# Minecraft Snapshot 23w04a

Tuesday is the new Wednesday, did you know? Here is snapshot 23w04a with a new experimental Armor Trim Smithing feature in the Update;;_;;1;;_;;20 experimental pack.

Happy trimming!

## Changes

-   Enchantment glint on items and armor is now more subtle

## Experimental Features

-   Added a new armor trimming system to visually customize your armor
-   Added Smithing Template items
-   Redesigned the Smithing Table
-   Changed how Netherite equipment is crafted

### Smithing Templates

-   Smithing Tables have been redesigned into a workstation for physical equipment upgrades and modifications
-   Alongside slots for combining a piece of equipment and materials, there is now a required slot for an item type called Smithing Templates
-   Smithing Templates define what type of upgrade you will be making to equipment
    -   It specifies both what type of items you can upgrade, and which ingredients are valid to customize the upgrade
    -   There are currently two categories of Smithing Templates: Armor Trim and Netherite Upgrade
-   Smithing Templates are consumed when used to upgrade an item in the Smithing Table
-   You can craft a copy of a Smithing Template in the Crafting Table with 7 diamonds + 1 block of material that the template is made out of + 1 smithing template, which will output 2 of the same Smithing Template

### Netherite Equipment

-   Netherite equipment crafting now also requires a Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template
-   Netherite Upgrade Smithing Templates can be found randomly in all Bastion Remnant chests, and there is a guarantee of 2 in every Treasure Room Bastion Remnant
-   This change was made for a variety of reasons:
    -   Increase the time players utilize Diamond equipment before Netherite
    -   Make Netherite equipment a more significant achievement in the game's progression
    -   Adapt Netherite more naturally into the new Smithing Table crafting system

### Armor Trims

-   You can now visually customize your armor with a variety of unique trims at the Smithing Table
    -   All armor is viable for trims except for leather armor
-   Armor trims are purely visual with no gameplay benefits, and can only be applied to Helmets, Chestplates, Leggings and Boots
    -   All trim patterns are visually the same on an armor's item icon, but the color will still change based on the trim material
    -   To check which trim pattern a piece of armor has, you can hover over it in the inventory
-   Armor Trim Smithing Templates can be found all throughout the world, and each of the following structures contain their own unique Smithing Template:
    -   Pillager Outpost
        -   Sentry Armor Trim
    -   Desert Pyramid
        -   Dune Armor Trim
    -   Shipwreck
        -   Coast Armor Trim
    -   Jungle Temple
        -   Wild Armor Trim
    -   Ocean Monument
        -   Tide Armor Trim
    -   Ancient City
        -   Ward Armor Trim
    -   Woodland Mansion
        -   Vex Armor Trim
    -   Nether Fortress
        -   Rib Armor Trim
    -   Bastion Remnant
        -   Snout Armor Trim
    -   Stronghold
        -   Eye Armor Trim
    -   End City
        -   Spire Armor Trim
-   Smithing Templates are found in chests in their respective structure, except for the Ocean Monument. Instead of finding it in chests, Elder Guardians sometimes drop a Smithing Template upon death
-   Some Armor Trim Smithing Templates are rarer than others, so be on the lookout for them to impress your friends!
-   An armor trim has two properties: a pattern and a material
    -   The pattern is defined by the Smithing Template used to apply the trim, and represents the visual pattern of the trim
    -   The material is defined by what ingredient you used to apply the trim, and represents the color of the trim
-   The viable ingredients you can use to define the color of your armor trim are the following:
    -   Iron
    -   Copper
    -   Gold
    -   Lapis
    -   Emerald
    -   Diamond
    -   Netherite
    -   Redstone
    -   Amethyst
    -   Quartz
-   Armor cannot have the same material it is made of applied to it as a trim
    -   For example, a Golden Chestplate cannot have a Golden Armor Trim

## Technical Changes

-   Added a new type of atlas configuration source: `paletted_permutations`
    
-   Armor Stands now preserve custom names when placed and broken
    
-   A new registry `trim_pattern` has been added for the armor trim system
    
-   A new recipe serializer `smithing_transform` has been added for the updated Netherite Upgrade recipe
    
-   A new recipe serializer `smithing_trim` has been added for the new Armor Trim recipe
    
-   Smithing table has temporarily two menu types
    
    -   Old menu without Smithing Template slot has been renamed to `legacy_smithing`
        -   Will be removed when Armor Trim feature stops being an experimental feature
    -   New menu with Smithing Template slot was added called `smithing`
-   Added new flag (value 128) to `HideFlags` NBT field for hiding armor trim item tooltips
    

### Paletted Permutations

-   `paletted_permutations` is a new type of atlas configuration source used to dynamically generate new textures in memory based on a set of color palettes
-   Color palettes allow you to swap out the colors of a texture without having to supply all files for the variants of a texture in a resource pack
-   This is useful for things like armor trims, where you want to be able to change the color of parts of the armor without having to create a new texture for each color
-   The `paletted_permutations` source has a set of required parameters:
    -   `textures` A list of namespaced locations of base textures
        -   These textures will be used to generate variants of them that have been modified by color palettes
    -   `palette_key` A namespaced location of a color palette key file
        -   A color palette key is used to define the set of key pixel colors we want to swap out with the color palettes defined below
    -   `permutations` A map of permutations from suffix to a namespaced location of a color palette file
        -   The suffix is appended at the beginning to the resource location of the output variant textures, with a `_` character separating the suffix and the base texture name
        -   The color palette is a texture file with a set of pixels that are used for replacing pixels that match the color palette key in each base texture
        -   The number of pixels in each color palette must be the same as that of the `palette_key` defined for this source
        -   Key matching is done by comparing the RGB values of each pixel in the `palette_key` to the RGB values of each pixel in the color palette
        -   Alpha channel is ignored for key matching, but in the resulting texture the alpha channel is multiplied with the color palette's alpha channel
        -   Pixels that do not match the `palette_key` are copied over to the resulting texture as-is
-   After defining a `paletted_permutations` source, you can then reference those namespaced output textures in other resources in your resource pack
    -   For example, if you have the following `paletted_permutations` source:
        
            {
                "type": "paletted_permutations",
                "textures": [
                    "minecraft:item/leather_helmet",
                    "minecraft:item/leather_chestplate",
                    "minecraft:item/leather_leggings",
                    "minecraft:item/leather_boots"
                ],
                "palette_key": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/leather_armor_color_key",
                "permutations": {
                    "red": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/red",
                    "green": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/green",
                    "blue": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/blue"
                }
            }
            
        
    -   You can then reference the resulting textures in other resources like this:
        
            {
                "textures": {
                    "layer0": "minecraft:item/leather_helmet_red",
                    "layer1": "minecraft:item/leather_chestplate_green",
                    "layer2": "minecraft:item/leather_boots_blue"
                }
            }
            
        

### Trim Patterns & Materials

-   Trim patterns and materials for armor are defined by the server through the `trim_pattern` and `trim_material` registry respectively
    -   As a result, new trim patterns and materials can be added via data packs
-   These are synchronized to clients when they join the server
    -   However, clients must have an accompanying resource pack to see those registered trim patterns and materials
    -   The paths to these textures are inferred based on the filename of the pattern json, and will try to find the textures within the same namespace as the trim pattern's `name` field
-   The following data is defined by a trim pattern:
    -   `asset_id` which is a namespaced id used to infer texture locations and localization
    -   `template_item` which is the id of the smithing template item used to apply the trim pattern
    -   `description` which is a text component used for displaying the pattern name of an armor trim when hovering an armor itemstack
-   The following data is defined by a trim material:
    -   `asset_name` which is a string used as a suffix for armor trim texture locations
    -   `ingredient` which is the id of the ingredient item used to apply the trim material
    -   `item_model_index` which is a float which defines the item model override each armor item model should target to change their visuals for this material
    -   `incompatible_armor_material` which is an optional id of the armor material this trim material cannot be applied to
    -   `description` which is a text component used for displaying the material name of an armor trim when hovering an armor itemstack
        -   The style defined in this description is applied to the armor trim pattern `description` as well

### Commands

-   New relation available for `execute on`: `origin`:
    -   shooter, if the executing entity is a projectile (like arrow, fireball, trident, firework, thrown potion, etc.)
    -   thrower, if the executing entity is an item
    -   source of effect, if the executing entity is an area effect cloud
    -   igniter, if the executing entity is a primed tnt
    -   summoner, if the executing entity is evoker fangs or a vex

### Commands

**`clone`**

The clone command now supports specifying the source and target dimensions. New syntax:

`clone [from <sourceDimension>] <begin> <end> [to <targetDimension>] <destination> ...`

Parameters:

-   `sourceDimension`: id of dimension to clone from
-   `targetDimension`: id of dimension to clone to

**`data`**

New source available:

-   `string <entity|block|storage> [path] [start] [end]` - reads a value as text, resulting in a string value

New arguments:

-   `start`: Index of first character to include at the start of the string

Parameters:

-   `pos`: Block position to check
-   `dimension`: A dimension id

**`execute on`**

New `execute` sub-command for selecting entities based on relation to the current executing entity:

-   `execute on <relation>`

Relations:

-   `vehicle` - entity that the executing entity is riding
-   `passengers` - all entities directly riding the executing entity (no sub-passengers)
-   `controller` - entity that is controlling the executing entity (for example: first passenger in a boat)
-   `owner` - owner of the executing entity, if it is a tameable animal (like cats, wolves or parrots)

    -   To retain existing functionality, you need to add an `s` suffix to pre-existing commands

**`ride`**

New command to allow entities to start or stop riding other entities

Syntax:

-   `ride <target> mount <vehicle>`
    -   Makes a single target mount a single vehicle
    -   The command will fail if:
        -   `vehicle` is a player
        -   `target` is already riding a vehicle
        -   `target` and `vehicle` are the same entity
        -   `vehicle` is already a passenger (direct or indirect) of `target`
-   `ride <target> dismount`
    -   Dismounts `target` from any vehicle it is riding
    -   Fails if `target` is not riding anything

### Game Rules

-   Added `commandModificationBlockLimit`, controlling the maximum number of blocks changed in one execution of `clone`, `fill` and `fillbiome`

### Chat components

**Translation fallback**

Added an optional `fallback` field to `translate` text components.
