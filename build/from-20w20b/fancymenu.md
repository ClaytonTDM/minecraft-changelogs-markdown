# Minecraft Snapshot 20w20b

This week we are releasing a bit of a smaller snapshot. However, if you're into switching game modes and completing advancements, this is right up your alley!

**Edit:** We've now released 20w20b to fix a bug

## Fixed Bug in 20w20b

-   [MC-183769](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-183769) NPE in server initialization

## New Features in 20w20a

-   Added new Game Mode Switcher debug menu
-   Added new Nether Advancements

​

### Game Mode Switcher

New F3 debug feature which allows you to switch game modes with traditional "tabbing" functionality. ​

-   Hold F3 and tap F4 to open the menu
-   Tapping F4 will cycle the game mode, or you can use the mouse
-   Release F3 to apply
-   Your last game mode is remembered and will be the first selected option, so you can quickly toggle between two game modes with a single press of F3 + F4!

​

#### F3 + N (Toggle Spectator)

A small change has been made to this debug combination. ​

-   By default, using this key would return to Creative after toggling from Spectator. It now will toggle back to the previous game mode you had.
-   As an example, if you were in Survival, then toggled to Spectator and back, you would be set back to Survival.

​

### New Advancements

-   `Hidden in the Depths` unlocks when obtaining Ancient Debris
-   `Cover Me in Debris` unlocks when obtaining full Netherite armor

-   `This Boat Has Legs` unlocks when riding a Strider with a Fungus on a Stick
-   `Hot Tourist Destinations` unlocks when visiting all Biomes in the Nether
-   `Those Were the Days` unlocks when entering a Bastion
-   `War Pigs` unlocks when looting a chest in a Bastion
-   `Oh Shiny` unlocks when distracting an angry Piglin with gold

​

## Changes in 20w20a

-   The `Bullseye` advancement now unlocks when hitting the bullseye of a target block from at least 30 meters away
-   The `Serious Dedication` advancement is now awarded for obtaining a Netherite Hoe
-   Obtaining Blackstone now also counts for the `Stone Age` advancement
-   Breeding Striders now counts for `The Parrots and the Bats` and is now required for `Two by Two`

​

## Technical Changes in 20w20a

-   Shulkers with "NoAI" can now be summoned with rotation.
-   Added `thrown_item_picked_up_by_entity` advancement trigger
-   Added `player_generates_container_loot` advancement trigger
-   Added `item_used_on_block` advancement trigger
-   Removed `safely_harvest_honey` advancement trigger

In this snapshot we made some changes to Redstone wire and we fixed a bunch of bugs.

## Changes in 20w18a

-   Redstone wire changes
-   The target block now conducts redstone signals

​

### Redstone wire

The blockstate, rendering and behavior of redstonewire are more in line with each other. Redstone will provide power to blocks on all sides it shows a visual connection to, and not do so on those sides without a visual connection. ​

-   A single redstone wire is now represented as a cross.
-   A wire on top of a block, which is redirected from below, will power the sides it is redirected to now. E.g. a fence gate above the redirecting wire will be powered.
-   Wires that redirect upwards to wires on non-conductive blocks used to only be redirected visually. Now this redirection applies to their behavior as well.
-   A wire that is redirected to go over a block will now always provide power to the block. This is most noticeable when the wire has signal strength 1.

​![Comparison between 1.15.2 and snapshot 20w18a](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/images/RedstoneChanges3_741x421.png)

## Technical Changes in 20w18a

-   Added a `enable-status` option to the server.properties file which if set to `false` will suppress replies to status requests from clients. This makes the server appear offline in the multiplayer screen.
-   Added control over how much entity data a server sends to clients
-   Advancement system changes

​

### Entity Broadcasting

It is now possible to control at what range the server sends data about entities to clients. ​

-   Added an `entity-broadcast-range-percentage` server property controlling how close entities need to be before being sent to clients. Higher values means entities are visible further away from players but cause more network traffic. Specifies percentage of default value, so for example `50` specifies half of the default range.

​

### Advancements

-   Added `player` check to every trigger (except `impossible`)
-   Entity checks in triggers can now use loot table condition syntax

​

#### Extended entity checks

Entity checks in triggers can now use loot table condition syntax. Old notation:

    {
      "trigger": "minecraft:player_killed_entity",
      "conditions": {
        "entity": {
          "type": "minecraft:blaze"
        }
      }
    }
    

is now equivalent to:

    {
      "trigger": "minecraft:player_killed_entity",
      "conditions": {
        "entity": [
          {
            "condition": "minecraft:entity_properties",
            "predicate": {
              "type": "minecraft:blaze"
            },
            "entity": "this"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    

**Note 1**: Like in loot tables, all conditions in top level array must be met for whole condition to trigger. ​ **Note 2**: To access new functionality, top level element must be JSON array. JSON object are interpreted as old notation.  
​ Full list of extended triggers:

-   New field `player` in every trigger
-   `bred_animals` - `parent`, `partner`, `child`
-   `channeled_lightning` - `victims`
-   `cured_zombie_villager` - `zombie`, `villager`
-   `fishing_rod_hooked` - `entity`
-   `killed_by_crossbow` - `victims`
-   `player_killed_entity` - `entity`
-   `entity_killed_player` - `entity`
-   `player_hurt_entity` - `entity`
-   `summoned_entity` - `entity`
-   `tame_animal` - `entity`
-   `target_hit` - `projectile`
-   `villager_trade` - `villager`

​

#### Miscellaneous trigger changes

-   Due to addition of `player`, existing contents of `location`, `slept_in_bed`, `hero_of_the_village`, `voluntary_exile` can now be placed in `location` field instead of top-level object. Old syntax is still supported, but depreciated.

-   Walls now create posts under more things, like pressure plates and banners
-   The "Singleplayer" button will jump directly to "Create World" screen if there are no worlds to select

## Technical Changes in 20w17a

-   Block storage format in chunks slightly changed to speed up various tasks (rendering, pathfinding, world generation, etc).
-   Chat component style can now select font.
-   Full range of Unicode characters is supported (some may know what that means 😉)
-   Added the `attribute` command

### World save format

-   Saving `level.dat` now uses randomly-named temporary files (instead of using `level.dat_new` every time)
-   `player/*.dat` are now saved in a way similar to `level.dat` (including leaving `.dat_old` files)

### Block storage

`BlockStates` in `Sections` elements no longer contain values stretching over multiple 64-bit fields. If number of bits per block is not power of two (i.e. single 64-bit value can't fill whole number of blockstates) some bits will not be used. For example, if single block state takes 5 bits, highest 4 bits of every 64-bit field will be unused. That also means slight increase in storage size (in case of 5 bits, from 320 to 342 64-bit fields).

### Commands

#### `attribute`

Adds modifies attribute on single entity. Possible syntax: Parameters:

-   `attribute <target> <attribute> get [<scale>]` - get total value of attribute
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> base set <value>` - sets base valye
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> base get [<scale>]` - get base value
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> modifier add <uuid> <name> <value> add|multiply|multiply_base` - adds modifier (fails if modifier is already present)
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> modifier remove <uuid>` - removes modifier
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> modifier value get <uuid> [<scale>]` - get value of modifier
-   `target` - single entity (note: only players, armor stands and mobs have attributes)
-   `attribute` - name of attribute (like `minecraft:generic.max_health`)
-   `name` - string (in optional quotes) describing human-readable name of modifier
-   `value` - floating point value (note: certain attributes have limits on final value, so your change might not be noticeable)

### Chat components

#### Hover event argument

-   `style.hoverEvent` parameter now has parameter `contents`, with contents depending on type:
    -   For `show_text` - chat component
    -   For `show_item` - either item id or object with fields `id`, `count` and `tag` (with last one being serialized NBT)
    -   For `show_entity` - object with fields: `id` (UUID), `name` (chat component) and `type` (entity type resource location)
-   Old style `value` argument is now deprecated (but still supported)

#### Colors

`color` property can now contain RGB value prefixed by `#`. For example `#55ff55` will result in the same color as `green`.

#### Custom fonts

Chat component style now supports `font` property, which is resource location for font in resource pack. No entry is equivalent to `minecraft:default`.

### Fonts

-   `Force Unicode` option now switches between normal and alternative font (called `uniform.json`) - no reload needed

---

Bastion remnants, or "home sweet home" as Piglins would call them, are finally here! This snapshot introduces the home of the Piglins. If you scour the world you might also find ruins of some old portals.

## New Features in 20w16a

-   Added Bastion Remnants!
-   Added Ruined Portals
-   Added chain blocks
-   Added a new music disc titled "Pigstep" by Lena Raine which can only be found in Bastions Remnants

### Bastion Remnants

What's made of Blackstone and full of piglins and hoglins? Bastion Remnants!

-   Added 4 separate Bastion Remnant types: Bridge, Hoglin Stable, Housing Units, and Treasure Room
-   You can find these sizable structures in all biomes in the Nether except the treacherous ash-dusted towers of Basalt Deltas
-   Explore, loot, and conquer a Bastion Remnant to call it your home...but beware, Piglins don't take kindly to intruders stealing their things

### Ruined Portals

Shattered remains of ancient nether portals. Wonder who built them?

-   They can be found in any overworld or nether biome
-   Some are hidden underground, under the sea, or buried in sand

## Changes in 20w16a

-   The piglin banner pattern can now be found in Bastion Remnants
-   Increased the amount of lava pools to make the deltas more "deltary"

## Technical Changes in 20w16a

-   Added a button in the GUI that generates a jigsaw structure starting from the jigsaw block, using given generation depth.
-   Expanded the max size per axis of Structure Blocks from 32 to 48
-   Added a JMX MBean to monitor dedicated server tick times

### JMX Monitoring

It is now possible to monitor the server tick times though JMX. The rationale for this is that JMX is a well known and supported monitoring technology with existing integrations and tools.

This enables server admins to hook alerts and graphing tools using ordinary JMX clients and dashboards.

#### Enabling JMX Monitoring

-   A new flag `enable-jmx-monitoring` has been added to the server.properties file which if set to `true` will expose an MBean with the Object name `net.minecraft.server:type=Server` and two attributes `averageTickTime` and `tickTimes` exposing the tick times in milliseconds.
-   In order for enabling JMX on the Java runtime you also need to add a couple of JVM flags to the startup as documented [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html).

It's a wonderful day here in Sweden today! The sun is shining and spring is in the air, and when I say "spring" I mean **pollen**. Let's remedy that by 1) Staying indoors and 2) Introduce an all new biome with a grain of basalt, blackstone, and magma cubes! To spice it up, we also have some new fine tunes for you to listen to while traversing the Nether. Enjoy the snapshot!

## New Features in 20w15a

-   Accessibility improvements
-   Added a piglin banner pattern
-   Added Basalt Deltas biome to the Nether
-   Added soul campfires. Warm your buns with the heat of one thousand souls!

### Accessibility

-   Added "Line Spacing" chat and accessibility option

### Basalt Deltas

Basalt Deltas can now be found in the Nether!

-   Remnants of volcanic eruptions, this biome sports a high concentration of Basalt columns and lava deltas
-   Walking through, you will be surrounded by flakes of flowing white ash
-   Magma Cubes finally have a place to call home, spawning very frequently
-   A new block, Blackstone, can be found in large patches here

### Nether Music

We're happy to announce that we've added three new tracks for the upcoming Nether Update, all composed by the very talented Lena Raine.

-   Rubedo will be played in the Nether Wastes
-   So Below will be played in Soul Sand Valleys and in Basalt Deltas
-   Chrysopoeia will be played in Crimson Forests

Some words from Lena:

-   "One of the primary instruments in Minecraft is the piano, and so one of my challenges to myself was to see how far I could push the sound of the piano until it resembled other things entirely–again, that alchemical process."
-   "I wanted each piece to feel like a progression of emotions, or a journey from place to place within this other world. There's a degree of beauty to the Nether, but it is also terrifying in both its details and scale."

Take a portal to the Nether, and stay awhile and listen...

## Changes in 20w15a

---

Even though we just added [every update imaginable to Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/article/every-update-imaginable-coming-minecraft), we thought that it might be good to pick up the Nether Update snapshots from where we left off. This snapshot introduces the Zoglins!

## New Features in 20w14a

-   Hoglins that somehow end up in the Overworld become Zoglins fairly quickly - but who would ever bring a Hoglin to the Overworld?
-   Compasses can now be enchanted with Curse of Vanishing

​

### Zoglins

​

-   Zoglins are zombified hoglins - the result of bringing a hoglin into the overworld
-   Unlike hoglins they can't be bred or fed, and they don't care about warped fungus
-   Beware - these beasts are raving mad and attack just about everything they see!

## Changes in 20w14a

-   The main menu background is now in the Nether
-   The General statistics list is now alphabetically sorted
-   Strider balancing

### Strider Balancing

-   Warped Fungus on a Stick now has 100 max item damage, and only takes 1 damage per Strider consume
-   When Warped Fungus on a Stick is used with Striders, the boost is a great way to traverse the lava seas

​

## Technical Changes in 20w14a

-   The compass now has `LodestonePos`, `LodestoneDimension` and `LodestoneTracked` data fields. If `LodestoneTracked` is zero, the game will skip checking for a Lodestone in the specified position.
-   Attributes are now added to game registry, similar to items, sound events, etc.
-   Region files are now opened in synchronous mode to increase reliability

​

### Attributes

Attributes have been moved to game registry. That means few changes: ​

-   Items and entities will no longer keep unknown attributes
-   Names of some attributes have been renamed to meet resource location requirements

#### Renames:

-   `generic.maxHealth` 🡆 `generic.max_health`

In this snapshot you can be on your merry way across the beautiful Soulsand Valleys with your freshly enchanted boots. It's a bit scary to be fair, so these boots will help you out with that bit...

## Before we dive into this snapshot, a word about Redstone

Redstone is one of the coolest things in Minecraft and many of you are members of communities that focus on building mind-blowing redstone contraptions, farms, computing machines and 256x256 piston doors.

A lot of redstone behaviour is currently categorized as “undefined”. This is when the behaviour of the block is not the result of intentional code but is a side-effect of unaccounted edge cases or quirks in the game code.​

We know that many players consider undefined behaviour as a very interesting aspect of redstone and enjoy experimenting with and using undefined behaviour to build unique contraptions to share with the rest of the community.​

However, the quirks of undefined behaviour can be quite surprising - even when building simple contraptions. This quirkiness can be a negative experience for players new to redstone and may turn them away from this very unique and exciting aspect of Minecraft as well as the vast redstone community behind it.​

Our goal is to bring all redstone components up to a level of quality that we are happy with and we will be making adjustments where it makes the most sense for redstone going forward.

Any changes we make will be communicated in the snapshot changelogs and as always we will be reading your feedback and comments.
