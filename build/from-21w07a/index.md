## Changes in 21w07a

-   Tweaks and updates to world generation and ores
-   Changes to the visuals of some ores and stone types
-   Reordered Redstone Tab in Creative Inventory

### World Generation

-   Tweaked huge caves to be more rare and decreased the chance that caves are filled with water
-   Changed ore generation to match the new world height and to add more strategy to mining
-   Tweaked size and positioning of diorite, andesite & granite generation
-   Exception: Diorite and Granite and Dirt no longer generate below y = 0
-   Strongholds are now mostly encased in stone
-   Mineshaft corridors are now supported by log pillars below or chains above when needed

### Visuals

-   Ores without unique shapes have been given new textures for accessibility reasons, so that each ore is distinguishable by shape alone
-   Being the most iconic ore, Diamond Ore texture is staying the same to keep that classic feel maintained
-   Blackstone, Polished Blackstone Bricks, and Cracked Polished Blackstone Bricks have had some minor touch ups

Hello, new snapshot! Hello, new cave generation!

Today's snapshot introduces a major change to how caves are generated within Minecraft. You could say that we're now introducing the cave part of Caves & Cliffs.

This is only the first step in our underground adventure, so please note that snapshots show features in early development and that there are two notable caveats with this snapshot:

-   You'll be unable to open old worlds in this snapshot as there is currently no upgrade path towards the new world height
-   All caves of the new type between y31 and y63 will be flooded with water

## New Features in 21w06a

-   Added noise caves and aquifers

### Noise caves and Aquifers

-   Noise caves are a new way of generating caves, providing more natural variety. They can get really huge sometimes! Noise caves come in two flavors:
    -   Cheese caves. Like the holes in swiss cheese. These often form caverns of various size.
    -   Spaghetti caves. Long squiggly tunnels, sometimes wide like tagliatelle.
-   No, they aren't loud. The "noise" part of noise caves is a technical term and has nothing to do with sound.
-   The old cave carvers and canyons still generate, combining with the noise caves to form interesting cave systems.
-   As with carvers, when noise caves intersect the surface they form cave entrances.
-   An aquifer is an area with local water level, independent of sea level. Aquifers are used during world generation to generate bodies of water inside noise caves. This sometimes results in large underground lakes!
-   For now, aquifers are only used below y31. This means all noise caves between y31 and sea level (y63) will be flooded with water, and noise cave entrances will essentially be lakes. This will be fixed later.
-   Magma sometimes generates at the bottom of underground bodies of water
-   Underwater cave carvers and underwater canyons have been removed, since aquifers are used to generate water in caves instead.

## Changes in 21w06a

-   Overworld build and generation limits have been expanded
-   Mineshafts adapted to larger caves
-   You can no longer crouch or jump to prevent a big dripleaf from tilting
-   A big dripleaf will now tilt rather than break when hit by a projectile
-   A redstone powered big dripleaf will not tilt (except when hit by a projectile)
-   The textures for hanging roots and small dripleaves have been updated

### World generation

-   Generation range and build limits have been expanded by 64 blocks up and 64 blocks down, to a total range of 384 blocks
-   Underground features, structures, and caves generate all the way down to y -64.

### Mineshaft changes

-   Mineshaft pieces don't generate if they would be fully floating in the air
-   Mineshaft corridors are supported by log pillars when needed
-   No floating cobwebs

## Fixed bugs in 21w06a

-   [MC-214346](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-214346) Big dripleaf can be broken with arrows in spawn protection
-   [MC-213813](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-213813) Small dripleaf can destroy any block

---

Snapshot 21w05b is a small snapshot to address a couple of bugs.

## Fixed bugs in 21w05b

-   [MC-203813](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-203813) Copper blocks are named inconsistently
-   [MC-213788](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-213788) The game can randomly freeze

## New Features in 21w05a

-   Azalea bushes as well as flowering azaela bushes!
-   Added cave vines and glow berries!
-   Added drip leaves!
-   Added decorative blocks for the upcoming lush caves: hanging roots and rooted dirt!
-   Added moss!
-   Added spore blossom!

### Cave vines and glow berries

-   Cave vines grow down from the ceiling, like weeping vines
-   When they grow they have a chance of producing glow berries
-   Glow berries are a natural light source as well as a food source
-   Foxes eat glow berries
-   Use glow berries to plant new cave vines
-   Bonemealing a cave vine will create glow berries

### Dripleaf

-   Small dripleaf needs moisture, so it grows on clay or underwater
-   Small dripleaf grow into big dripleaf when bonemealed.
-   Big dripleaf grows taller when bonemealed
-   If you stand on a big dripleaf it will tilt after a while and you will fall off
-   You can crouch or jump to prevent a big dripleaf from tilting
-   A tilted big drip leaf will tilt up again after a while
-   The big dripleaf will break when hit by a projectile
-   The wandering trader will sometimes sell small dripleaf plants

### Moss

-   Two new decorative blocks: Moss block and moss carpet
-   Moss carpet can be crafted from moss blocks

### Spore blossom

-   A beautiful large flower placed on ceilings
-   Particles drip from it

## Changes in 21w05a

-   The stonecutter can be used to craft the different copper block variants
-   The stages of copper oxidization are now called "Copper Block", "Exposed Copper Block", "Weathered Copper Block" and "Oxidized Copper Block" in sequence of least to most oxidized
-   Drowned now have a chance of dropping a copper ingot, they no longer drop gold ingots
-   Added new sculk sensor events
-   Changes to powder snow

### Sculk Sensor Changes

Added the following game events that the Sculk Sensor reacts to, along with corresponding frequency value:

Vibration Types

Frequency Value

Minecart Moving, Ring Bell, Block Change

6

Drinking Finish, Prime Fuse

7

Mob Interact

8

Equip, Shear, Ravager Roar

9

Entity Place

12

Entity Killed

13

Shulker Close

14

Shulker Open

15

-   `Block Change` is for when player or dispenser action has changed a block. Example: cake slice being eaten.
-   `Mob Interact` is for specific mob interaction events that cause vibrations.
-   `Prime Fuse` is for both TNT and Creepers.

### Powder Snow changes

-   Flaming arrows now get extinguished when they collide with Powder Snow
-   Skeletons now convert to Strays when frozen
-   Powder snow is now pushable by pistons and sticky pistons
-   Foxes can now walk on top of powder snow without falling in

## Technical Changes in 21w05a

-   Improved performance when using many overrides on an item model
-   Copper oxidization is now a random tick effect and thus affected by the randomTickSpeed game rule
