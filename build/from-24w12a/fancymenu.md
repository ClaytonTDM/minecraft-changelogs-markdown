# Minecraft Snapshot 24w12a

Here's snapshot 24w12a with new advancements and several tweaks.

Happy Mining!

## Experimental Features

### Trial Chambers

Trial Chambers now generate slightly more rarely and a bit more spaced out from each other

### Trial Chambers Explorer Map

-   Struggle no more to locate a Trial Chamber - level up your nearest Cartographer to Journeyman for the opportunity to trade for an Explorer Map pointing to a nearby Trial Chamber

### Heavy Core

-   Can now be waterlogged
-   Survives lava flows
-   Most efficient tool is now the pickaxe
-   Adjusted destroy time and explosion resistance

### Advancements

-   Added the following advancements:
    -   `Minecraft: Trial(s) Edition` - Step foot in a Trial Chamber
    -   `Under Lock & Key` - Unlock a Vault using a Trial Key
    -   `[Challenge - 40 exp] Blowback` - Kill a Breeze with a deflected Wind Charge
    -   `Who Needs Rockets?` - Use a Wind Charge to launch yourself upward at least 8 blocks
    -   `Crafters Crafting Crafters` - Be near a Crafter when it crafts a Crafter
    -   `Lighten Up` - Scrape a Copper Bulb with an Axe to make it brighter
    -   `Over-Overkill` - Deal 50 hearts of damage in a single hit using the Mace

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 36
-   The Resource Pack version is now 30
-   -   Particle `entity_effect` takes color argument when spawned from command
    -   `/particle entity_effect <r> <g> <b> <a>`
    -   4 float values ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 representing RGBA

## Data Pack Version 36

-   Added a `crafter_recipe_crafted` trigger which is triggered when a Crafter ejects a successfully crafted item into the world.
    -   `<player>` an entity predicate matching the player who is nearby
    -   `<recipe_id>` is the ID of the recipe being crafted
    -   `<ingredients>` is a list of item predicates matching the ingredients that form the recipe being crafted
-   Added a `fall_after_explosion` trigger which is triggered when a player begins falling after being knocked upwards by an explosion or wind burst
    -   `<player>` an entity predicate matching the player who is falling
    -   `<start_position>` a location predicate matching the position the player was at when they were hit by the explosion or burst
    -   `<distance>` a distance predicate matching how far the player must be from `start_position` to cause the trigger to activate
    -   `<cause>` an entity predicate matching the entity which caused the explosion or burst to happen
-   Added `storage` loot number provider to access values from command storage
-   New Entity Type Tag: `sensitive_to_smite` - for Entity Types that take extra damage from the Smite Enchantment
-   Expanded item predicate syntax used in `execute if|unless items` and `clear` commands
-   Removed redundant custom data section (`{...}`) from item arguments (it's fully replaced by `[custom_data={...}]`)
    -   To make this transition easier, `custom_data` item sub-predicate has been changed to allow unquoted SNBT
-   Added `wolf` entity sub-predicate for matching wolf variants
-   `wolf`, `cat`, `frog` and `painting` entity sub-predicates now accept tags and plain lists instead of just single elements
-   Changed texture asset paths in `wolf_variant` to better match other formats
-   Command arguments that previously accepted namespaced ids of loot tables, modifiers and predicates can now also accept inline definitions
-   Added new item stack components
-   Added new loot functions

### `wolf_variant` definitions

-   Field `texture` has been renamed to `wild_texture`
-   `wild_texture`, `tame_texture` and `angry_texture` no longer require values to be prefixed with `textures/` and suffixed with `.png`

### Commands

#### Inline loot values

Arguments in following commands that previously accepted namespaced ids of loot tables, modifiers and predicates can now also accept inline definitions:

-   `loot`
-   `item`
-   `execute if predicate` Values have same structure as matching JSON files, though they are encoded as SNBT. Example: `execute if predicate {condition:weather_check, raining:true}`

### Loot tables

#### `storage` number provider

-   This number provider is able to access numeric values from command storage directly
-   If selected storage does not exist or tag selected by path is not numeric or does not exist, provider returns 0
-   Fields:
    -   `storage` - namespaced id of command storage
    -   `path` - NBT path to field

#### `set_lore` function

-   The `replace` field has been removed
-   Now has `mode` like `set_fireworks` and `set_written_book_pages`

#### `set_written_book_pages` function

-   `pages` is now a JSON Object rather than a string containing JSON

#### `toggle_tooltips` loot function

-   This function can be used to modify item component tooltip visiblity
-   It works by setting fields like `show_in_tooltip` without changing other values
-   Format:
    -   `toggles` - a map of supported item component type to boolean value
-   Supported components: `trim`, `dyed_color`, `enchantments`, `stored_enchantments`, `unbreakable`, `can_break`, `can_place_on`, `attribute_modifiers`
-   Example:
    -   `{function:"toggle_tooltips","toggles":{"enchantments":false}}` will hide enchantments tooltip

#### Functions

-   Nested lists are no longer supported in function lists

### Item predicate argument

The item predicate syntax (used in `execute if|unless items` and `clear` commands) has been significantly expanded.

-   The general syntax is: `<type> [comma-separated list of <test>]`
-   `<type>` can be one of:
    -   item id
    -   item tag id prefixed with `#`
    -   `*` to match any item
-   `<test>` can have one of 3 forms:
    -   `<component_id>=<value>` - match exact value of component (same as in previous format)
        -   `<value>` is a representation of component value in SNBT format (same as in `item give` argument)
    -   `<component_id>` - check if component exists
    -   `<predicate_id>~<value>` - check item sub-predicate
        -   `<value>` is a representation of item sub-predicate in SNBT format (but otherwise same as one used for advancement and loot table JSON files)
        -   Example: `*[damage~{durability:{min:3}}]` will match any stack with at least 3 uses left
-   The special name `minecraft:count` can be used for matching the stack size
    -   `count=<positive int>` will pass only when the stack size equals the given value
    -   `count~<int range>` will pass when the stack size is in the specified range
        -   Example: `*[count~{max:2}]` will match any stack with count <= 2
    -   `count` will always pass
-   Any `<test>` entry can be negated by prefixing with `!`
    -   Example: `*[!count=1]` will match any stack that has count other than 1
-   `<test>` elements can be also joined with `|` to check multiple alternatives
    -   Example: `*[!damage|damage=0]` will look for items without damage component or with `0` damage
-   The syntax for custom data partial matching (`{}`) has been removed in favor of using `custom_data` predicates
    -   So `stick{a:2}` becomes `stick[custom_data~{a:2}]`

### Predicates

#### Item sub-predicates

-   Predicate `minecraft:custom_data` now accepts both SNBT data written as a string (existing format) and unflattened tags
    -   That means that `*[custom_data~{a:1}]` and `*[custom_data~"{a:1}"]` are equivalent
    -   Flattened string format has been kept since NBT type information can't be expressed in JSON

#### Entity sub-predicates

##### `wolf`

New `wolf` sub-predicate has been added to match wolf variants Fields:

-   `variant` - wolf variant to match (single entry, list of entries or tag)

##### `cat`, `frog`, `painting`

-   Field `variant` now accepts single entries, list of entries or tags

        -   `blocks`: single block, list of blocks, or `#`;;-;;prefixed block tag to match
        -   `speed` (optional): float, overrides the mining speed if present and matched
        -   `correct_for_drops` (optional): boolean, overrides whether this tool is considered 'correct' if present and matched
            -   `true` will cause the block to mine at its most efficient speed, and drop items if the targeted block requires that
    -   `default_mining_speed`: float, mining speed to use if no rules match and override mining speed (default: `1.0`)
    -   `damage_per_block`: non-negative int, amount of durability to remove each time a block is mined with this tool

Oh look, it's a rare case of snapshot Thursday! This week we're expanding your arsenal with a smashing new weapon, the Mace! Use this weapon's special smash attack while leaping from a high place and watch your enemies get knocked back. The longer you fall, the harder you hit – but make sure you time it right! Your fall damage is only negated if you land the blow. Craft this new weapon by combining a Breeze Rod with the Heavy Core, a new item you can find by unlocking Trial Chamber Vaults.

As usual, we invite you to share your thoughts about this new feature over at the feedback site: [Let's talk about the Mace!](https://aka.ms/mcmacefeedback)

Alongside this hefty new mob swatter, we're also bringing you new chambers and variations to Trial Chambers, updated loot tables for Vaults, new Pottery Sherds, Armor Trims and Banner Patterns—as well as the usual slew of bug fixes and polish.

Happy mace-ing!

## Experimental Features

-   Added the Mace
-   Added Breeze Rod
-   Added Heavy Core
-   Added 2 new Armor Trims
-   Added 3 new Pottery Sherds
-   Added 2 new Banner Patterns
-   Updated Vault loot table
-   Updated Trial Chambers

## Blocks

### Heavy Core

-   A mysterious, dense block which can be combined with a Breeze Rod to craft a brand-new weapon: the Mace!

## Items

### Breeze Rod

-   An item dropped by the Breeze that can be crafted into 4 Wind Charges, or used with the Heavy Core to craft the Mace

### Mace

-   A new heavy weapon to smash your enemies!
-   Leverage the weight of this new weapon to deal additional damage the farther you fall before hitting your target
    -   Try it out by jumping down toward your target, and hit them before you hit the ground
    -   Successfully striking a target in this way will negate any damage accumulated from the fall, similar to how a Wind Charge works
    -   Other entities near the struck enemy will be knocked back by the immense force of the Mace
-   Using a Mace will decrease its durability like any other weapon; repair it with Breeze Rods at an anvil
-   Players can use a Mace in combination with Wind Charges to launch up and deliver devastating smash attacks on their enemies

## Mobs

### Breeze

-   Drops 1-2 Breeze Rods when killed by a player
    -   The number of Breeze Rods dropped is affected by looting enchantments

-   Trial Spawners will now appear more frequently in the corridors
-   Changed the layout of the blocks around the Vaults
-   The loot tables of Vaults in Trial Chambers have been updated to address some inventory management issues
    -   You will now get no more than 1 unstackable item per Vault
    -   You will more often get rewards which can stack together
    -   Horse Armor and Saddles have been removed from the loot table
-   Vaults in Trial Chambers can now eject:
    -   Wind Charges
    -   Bolt Armor Trim Smithing Template
    -   Flow Armor Trim Smithing Template
    -   Flow Banner Pattern
    -   Guster Banner Pattern
    -   Heavy Core

## Changes

-   Adjusted flying behaviour for Bees and Parrot to keep them from overshooting their position when flying up and down
-   Status effect particle colors are no longer blended into one particle color
    -   All active visible status effect particles are now rendered separately
    -   The frequency of emitting status effect particles has been lowered to clutter the screen less
-   Updated the wolf armor crack textures
-   Menu background blur has been updated to look better and be more performant

### Wolf variants

When summon in other ways (e.g. using the Spawn Egg or using the `summon` command), the variant selection follows the natural spawning biome rules with the following extensions:

-   Rusty Wolf: will be selected in all Jungle biomes, including Jungle and Bamboo Jungle Biomes
-   Spotted Wolf: will be selected in all Savanna biomes, including Savanna and Windswept Savanna Biomes
-   Striped Wolf: will be selected in all Badlands biomes, including Badlands and Eroded Badlands Biomes

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 35
-   The Resource Pack version is now 29

## Data Pack Version 35

-   Removed `any` entity sub-predicate
-   Component-specific item predicate properties have been moved to separate field `predicates`
-   Added slot name `contents` for single-slot entities like item frames and item displays
-   Contents of `item` entity can now be accessed through `contents` slot name
-   Added new loot functions

### Predicates

#### Item sub-predicate

-   Some fields from item predicate have been moved to a map in an optional field `predicates`
-   The new field is similar to the `components` field on item stacks
-   This was done to simplify addition for future predicates and to allow sub-predicates to more closely resemble names of components they match
-   The following fields have been moved:
    -   `enchantments` - field moved to sub-predicate `minecraft:enchantments`
    -   `stored_enchantments` - field moved to sub-predicate `minecraft:stored_enchantments`
    -   `potions` - field moved to sub-predicate `minecraft:potion_contents`
    -   `custom_data` - field moved to sub-predicate `minecraft:custom_data`
-   `durability` field has been expanded to `minecraft:damage` predicate:
    -   This check now works for any item that has `minecraft:damage` component
    -   An item that does not have a `minecraft:damage` component can never match
    -   To check for unbreakable items, query value of `minecraft:unbreakable` component
    -   Fields:
        -   `damage` - optional bounds for value of `minecraft:damage` component
        -   `durability` - optional bounds for durability (max damage minus value of `minecraft:damage`)
-   Predicates `minecraft:enchantments`, `minecraft:stored_enchantments`, `minecraft:potion_contents` and `minecraft:damage` require matching component to exist on item
    -   That means that, for example, matching for empty enchantment list will not pass on items without `minecraft:damage` component
    -   Note: some components, like `minecraft:enchantments` have default values, so they will always match

##### Example:

Before:

    "item": {
      "enchantments": [
        {
          "enchantment": "minecraft:silk_touch",
          "levels": {
            "min": 1
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    

After:

    "item": {
      "predicates": {
        "minecraft:enchantments": [
            {
              "enchantment": "minecraft:silk_touch",
              "levels": {
                "min": 1
              }
            }
          ]
      }
    }

Woah, another snapshot day of the Wednesday variant! Today we are releasing 24w10a, featuring new Wolf Variants, some new Data Pack features, and lots of bug fixes.

Happy mining!

## New Features

-   Added variants of Wolves

### Wolf variants

-   New Wolf variants have been added
-   The variant is determined by the biome they spawn in
    -   Pale Wolf - The familiar Wolf variant that now spawns in the Taiga biome, with a default pack size of 4
    -   Woods Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Forest biome. This will be the dominant Wolf variant that you will be able to find in the Overworld, since the Forest biome is very common
    -   Ashen Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Snowy Taiga biome
    -   Black Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Old Growth Pine Taiga biome, in smaller packs of 2 to 4
    -   Chestnut Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Old Growth Spruce Taiga biome, in smaller packs of 2 to 4
    -   Rusty Wolf - A variant that spawns in a new location for wolves - the Sparse Jungle biome, in smaller packs of 2 to 4
    -   Spotted Wolf - A variant that spawns in a new location for wolves - the Savanna Plateau biome, in larger packs of 4 to 8
    -   Striped Wolf - A variant that spawns in a new location for wolves, the Wooded Badlands biome, in larger packs of 4 to 8
    -   Snowy Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Grove biome. A rare type, that always walks alone
-   Adjusted spawning conditions for Wolves, allowing them to spawn on Coarse Dirt and Podzol blocks

## Changes

-   Adjusted passive mobs spawning in Grove biome to only include Rabbits, Foxes and Wolves
-   Button tooltips will no longer appear when hovering outside the containing element

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 34

## Data Pack Version 34

-   Recipe results can now specify component data
-   Added new entity predicate field `slots`, for matching item slots
-   Added slot names for ranges, like `container.*`
-   Added `execute if|unless items` to check and count items
-   Banner Patterns are now data-driven
-   Changes to Item Stack Component formats
-   Player Head blocks now store a `custom_name` tag, which will be copied to and from the item form when broken or placed
-   The `SkullOwner` and `ExtraType` fields in Player Head blocks have been replaced with a `profile` field, with the same format as the item component
-   For now, the `count` field on Item Stacks is always stored again, even if `1`
    -   If the field is missing in data, will still fall back to `1`

### Recipes

-   Recipe types `crafting_shaped`, `crafting_shapeless`, `stonecutting` and `smithing_transform` now accept `components` for the `result` item stack
-   The `result` field for recipe types `smelting`, `blasting`, `smoking` and `campfire_cooking` is now an item stack format without a count, which means you'll need to specify an object with an `id` field
    -   This `result` now also accepts `components` data

### Predicates

#### `slots` entity sub-predicate

-   New entity field `slots` allows to check single or multiple slots on any entity
-   The field contains a map of slot names (same as ones used in `item` commands) to item predicate
-   For slot ranges, only one slot needs to match for whole entry to pass

Example:

    {
        "condition": "minecraft:entity_properties",
        "entity": "this",
        "predicate": {
            "slots": {
                "container.*": {
                    "items": "dirt"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    

### Slot names

-   Slot names (used in `item` commands and `slots` entity predicates) now include slot ranges
-   Unless specified, existing commands can still only work on single slots
-   New slot names:
    -   `container.*` - contains `container.0` to `container.53`
    -   `hotbar.*` - contains `hotbar.0` to `hotbar.8`
    -   `inventory.*` - contains `inventory.0` to `inventory.26`
    -   `enderchest.*` - contains `enderchest.0` to `enderchest.26`
    -   `villager.*` - contains `villager.0` to `villager.7`
    -   `horse.*` - contains `horse.0` to `horse.14`
    -   `weapon.*` - contains `weapon.mainhand` and `weapon.offhand`
    -   `armor.*` - contains `armor.head`, `armor.chest`, `armor.legs`, `armor.feed`, `armor.body`
    -   `player.cursor` - item held by player on screen
        -   Note: this information is not available in creative mode
    -   `player.crafting.0` - `player.crafting.3`, `player.crafting.*` - player's crafting slots
        -   Note: this includes only player's inventory crafting slots. Crafting table (or any other slots on other screens) are not included

#### `execute if|unless items`

-   `execute if|unless items <source> <slots> <item_predicate>` command can be used to count items
    -   `<source>` is the same as one used in `item` command, i.e.
        -   `block <x> <y> <z>`
        -   `entity <target>` (selector can return multiple entities)
    -   `<slots>` can accept single slot (like `container.0`) or a range (like `container.*`)
    -   `<item_predicate>` is the same as item predicate in `clear` command
-   If used alone, it will return total number of items in stacks that match predicates

### Banner Patterns

-   Banner Patterns will now be loaded into a dynamic registry from data packs (`data/<namespace>/banner_pattern/<id>`)
    -   These entries have two fields:
        -   `asset_id` (namespaced string) is used to resolve texture locations
            -   e.g. `custom:pattern` resolves to `assets/custom/textures/entity/banner/pattern.png`, `assets/custom/textures/entity/shield/pattern.png`
        -   `translation_key` (string) is a translation key prefix
            -   e.g. `block.minecraft.banner.custom.pattern` resolves to `block.minecraft.banner.custom.pattern.<dye color>`

### Item Stack Components

-   The `minecraft:profile` component no longer requires the `name` field to be present
-   Some additional Item Stack Components now support alternative, simple definitions:
    -   `minecraft:profile` can be defined as string player name (e.g. `profile="jeb_"`)
    -   `minecraft:dyed_color` can be defined as an integer rgb color (e.g. `dyed_color=16711680`)
    -   `minecraft:attribute_modifiers` can be defined as a direct list of modifiers (e.g. `attribute_modifiers=[{type:'generic.scale',uuid:[1,2,3,4],name:'Big!',amount:1.0,operation:'add_multiplied_base'}]`)
    -   `minecraft:potion_contents` can be defined as a single potion id (e.g. `potion_contents="invisibility"`)
    -   `minecraft:enchantments` and `minecraft:stored_enchantments` can be defined as an inline map of enchantment id to level (e.g. `enchantments={sharpness:1}`)
    -   These are only an alternative for defining the values, they will always be stored in their full formats
-   All container blocks now use the `minecraft:container` component when in item form, not just Shulker Boxes
-   The `minecraft:lodestone_target` component has been renamed to `minecraft:lodestone_tracker`
    -   The `pos` and `dimension` fields have been moved into a `target` object
    -   The `target` field is optional, and if not present, the compass will spin
-   The maximum number of lore and fireworks entries has been raised to 256

Hello! Here is a slightly bigger than usual snapshot with a lot of technical changes, refreshed UI, another iteration of Wolf Armor, and tweaks to new features.

Since the initial release of the Wolf Armor, we have been working on improving it to increase its protection, usability and add customization. For protection there is a new approach to armor, which considers the player's need to quickly see the state of the armor without using UI elements, and the ability to act quickly to help their pet wolf if needed. Please try it out and let us know what you think over at the feedback site: [Let's talk about Wolf Armor!](https://aka.ms/wolfarmorfeedback)

## Experimental Features

### Bogged

-   The Bogged drops 2 mushrooms (either both red/brown or one of each) when sheared
-   Updated Bogged texture and model

### Wind Charge

-   Removed randomness from the radius of both Breeze- and player-shot Wind Charges

### Vault

-   Additional changes to the Vault texture to even further distinguish from Trial Spawners

## Changes

-   Changes to Wolf Armor
-   The game's UI has been updated with a fresher look
-   Ctrl+Picking a renamed block (such as a Chest) in Creative Mode will now give a renamed item

### Wolf Armor

-   The Wolf Armor will protect the wolf from most damage sources until the armor loses all durability and breaks
-   Wolf Armor shows signs of increased breakage as durability goes down
-   Players can repair the Wolf Armor with Armadillo Scutes while it is equipped on the Wolf
-   Wolf armor can be dyed in similar fashion to Leather Armor
-   The Wolf's owner can now repair Wolf Armor on a Wolf

### UI

The UI has been updated to sport a fresher look and to be more consistent when it comes to the layout of different UI elements, all while retaining the essence and feel of the old screens.

As always, we're eager to hear your thoughts and opinions on further improvements or changes. Let us know what you think over at the [dedicated feedback site](https://aka.ms/JavaUIFeedback).

-   The menu background dirt texture has been replaced by a darkened background
    -   The dirt texture has been moved to the build-in Programmer Art Resource Pack
    -   Outside the game, the menu Panorama is displayed across all screen
    -   In the game, the world will be visible across all screens
    -   Paired with the darkened background is a blur
        -   The strength of the blur can be configured in Accessibility Settings
        -   In-game screens such as containers and books are not affected by these changes
-   Screen elements such as titles and buttons are positioned more consistently across different screens
-   The Player and World Backups screens in Realms have been updated
-   Lists now have clearer borders at the top and bottom
-   After defeating the Ender Dragon and entering the End Portal, the End Poem and credits are now displayed with a background based on the animated End Portal effect

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 33
-   The Resource Pack version is now 28
-   `playsound` command can now be used without specifying the player (assuming `@s`) and without specifying the mixer (assuming `master`)
-   In single player, when errors occur during loading or saving of chunks a warning will be shown in a toast
-   Trying join a single player world with less than 64 MB free disk space will show a warning screen
    -   Additionally, a warning toast will be shown periodically while in game

## Data Pack Version 33

-   Added `minecraft:bypasses_wolf_armor` for damage sources that can not be absorbed by Wolf Armor
-   Loot table entry with id `loot_table` now also accepts inline loot tables
-   Unstructured NBT data attached to stacks of items (`tag` field) has been replaced with structured 'components'

### Loot Tables

Loot table entry `loot_table` (which returns all items from provided nested loot table) now has the following syntax:

-   `value` - can be either:
    -   namespaced id - reference to another named loot table
    -   full loot table (same format as in standalone file)

### Item Stack Components

We are making some large changes to how Item Stack-specific properties are stored and represented in this snapshot, replacing the current NBT 'tag' with structured components.

This change has been made in order to:

-   Improve performance in cases where the game needs to frequently look up some property of an item (e.g. Armor Trims rendering every frame)
-   Validate item properties at load time, enabling easier identification of invalid data in commands and data packs
    -   This should avoid any 'silent' breakages in commands specifying custom item data for any potential future format changes
-   Continue to evolve the game to enable the creation of dynamic content

We understand that this is a significant breaking change for many datapacks and custom maps which will require significant effort to upgrade.

We do however believe that this builds critical foundations for future extensibility. We have taken care to ship these changes all at once, with the hope that this avoids future incremental changes requiring many small updates to packs.

The current NBT 'tag' has existed for quite some time, and we are aware that a lot of clever techniques have been developed with this for commands and data packs.

Although we have made our best effort to identify these cases, some of these techniques rely on undocumented or undefined behavior with certain tag configurations.

We want to ensure that no functionality is lost without a suitable alternative, but due to the undocumented nature of these techniques, we have very likely not caught everything!

We hope to address any regressions over the remaining course of this snapshot cycle.

With such a large change, we deeply value your feedback! You can share your thoughts on these changes over at the feedback site: [Let's talk about Item Stack Components!](https://aka.ms/ItemStackComponentsFeedback).

-   Unstructured NBT data attached to stacks of items (`tag` field) has been replaced with structured 'components'
    -   This data is parsed and validated when the item is loaded
    -   This should improve performance in certain scenarios (e.g. Armor Trim rendering) when item data was frequently compared or requested and parsed
    -   Custom data can still be stored in the `minecraft:custom_data` component
-   Item types (e.g. `minecraft:stick`) hold a set of default components on an item that individual item stacks can override
-   The format of serialized items and items in data packs has been updated for consistency and to support components
-   Item syntax in commands has been updated to support components
-   When advanced tooltips are enabled (F3+H), the number of components will be displayed instead of number of tags
-   Default component values for items are now listed in `items.json` generated in `reports` directory
-   The `ignoreTags` field on villager trades has been removed and replaced by a component predicate on damage
-   Block definitions are now added to `blocks.json` report (note: those definitions are not used yet and present only for informational purposes)
-   If the `key_item` field of Vault block is not present, the Vault cannot be unlocked

#### `minecraft:custom_data`

-   Copied to Shulker Box block when placed
-   Replaces `BlockEntityTag.Items` tag
-   Format: list of slots
    -   `slot`: integer ;;[;;0; 255;;];;, representing a slot in the container
    -   `item`: item stack
    -   e.g. `container=[{slot:7,item:{id:'diamond_pickaxe',components:{'minecraft:unbreakable':{}}}}]`
-   On Shulker Boxes, has an implicit default value of: `[]`

#### `minecraft:bees`

-   Holds the bees inside a Beehive or Bee Nest
-   Copied to Beehive or Bee Nest block when placed
-   Replaces `BlockEntityTag.Bees` tag
-   Format: list of bees
    -   `entity_data`: map of string to string
        -   `id`: entity id
        -   The remainder tags merged into the Bee when spawned
    -   `ticks_in_hive`: integer
    -   `min_ticks_in_hive`: integer

-   On Beehive and Bee Nest, has an implicit default value of: `[]`

#### `minecraft:lock`

-   Holds the lock state of a container-like block
    -   An item with a custom name of the same value must be used to open this container
-   Copied to container block when placed
-   Replaces `BlockEntityTag.Lock` tag
-   Format: string value, representing the key
    -   e.g: `lock='hunter2'`

#### `minecraft:container_loot`

-   Holds the unresolved loot table and seed of a container-like block

    -   `loot_table`: loot table id
    -   `seed`: long, pseudorandom seed to resolve the loot table with (optional)
        -   If not specified, or `0`, the seed will be picked randomly when the loot table is evaluated
    -   e.g. `container_loot={loot_table:'minecraft:chests/buried_treasure',seed:123}`

#### `minecraft:block_entity_data`

-   Stores unstructured NBT data to apply to a block entity when placing a block such as a Chest or Furnace
-   Replaces previous `BlockEntityTag` tag, with same behavior
-   Any block entity data moved into a dedicated item component is removed from this tag
-   This tag only works for Command Blocks, Lecterns, Signs, and Spawners if the player is an operator
-   Format: object with fields
    -   Must contain an `id` field with the block entity type
    -   Any additional fields will be merged into the block entity when placed

    -   If `false`, an item with a glint will not display this glint (either from enchantments or intrinsic properties of the item)
    -   e.g: `enchantment_glint_override=true`

### Commands

-   Commands such as `/give`, `/item`, `/loot`, and `/clear` have updated item syntax
-   Components can now be specified after the item name in square brackets
    -   Components are assigned with an `=` (e.g. `wooden_pickaxe[damage=23]`)
    -   Components are comma-separated (e.g. `netherite_hoe[damage=5,repair_cost=2]`)
-   Component types will be autocompleted, but values themselves will not
-   Values will however be validated, and the command will fail to parse if the component is improperly specified
    -   e.g. `/give @s wooden_pickaxe[damage=-34]` is not valid
-   The pre-existing NBT syntax (`{...}`) is rewired to set or match the `minecraft:custom_data` component
    -   e.g. `/give @s stick{foo:'bar'}` is equivalent to `/give @s stick[custom_data={foo:'bar'}]`
    -   If both `[...]` and `{...}` are specified, `[...]` must be ordered before `{...}`
-   Item predicate arguments (in `/clear`) have new semantics with respect to matching components and custom data
    -   Every specified component must be present on the target item, and have an exactly equal parsed value
    -   Components with defaults (e.g. `damage=0` by default) will be assumed to exist on the target item if not specified
        -   As such, `/clear @s diamond_pickaxe[damage=0]` will match only undamaged Diamond Pickaxes
        -   On the other hand, `/clear @s diamond_pickaxe` will match any Diamond Pickaxe, irrespective of damage
    -   Exact matching of component values applies even for the `minecraft:custom_data` component
    -   However, using the `{...}` custom data syntax will use pre-existing NBT partial match behaviour
        -   This requires that all tags specified in the predicate are present on the target item, but additional ones may be ignored
        -   Lists in the target must contain all items specified in the predicate, but additional may be present and order is ignored
-   Modifier operations in the `/attribute` command have been renamed:
    -   `add` -> `add_value`
    -   `multiply_base` -> `add_multiplied_base`
    -   `multiply` -> `add_multiplied_total`

### Item Stack Format

-   Along with format changes due to components, the structures of item stacks on disk and in data packs have been updated for consistency
-   Previous `id` (string) and `Count` (byte) fields have been replaced with `id` (namespaced string) and `count` (integer) fields
    -   This format is additionally applied to the `icon` field in advancements, items in chat component hover events, and the `result` field in smelting recipes (`result` and `count` are no longer inlined)
-   The `count` field is optional (defaults to `1`), and no longer stored if default
    -   Stack size is now limited to the maximum stack size of the item
-   The `tag` field has been removed, and any remaining contents will end up in the `minecraft:custom_data` component when upgrading
-   A new `components` field stores all components attached to an item
    -   Format: map of component id to component value (varies by component id)
        -   e.g. `{..., components: {'minecraft:damage': 12}}`
        -   Components with a `!` prefix (e.g. `"!minecraft:damage": {}`) will cause this component to be removed
    -   Components equal to their default value will not be stored
-   The item stack format no longer represents empty stacks (`air` item, or `count` 0)
    -   Instead, in places that support it, the field should be ommitted
    -   In some cases, such as lists of stacks (e.g. `HandItems` in living entities), an empty map (`{}`) is used to represent empty stacks

### Other Format Changes

-   Tipped Arrows no longer store their applied potion effects
    -   This is instead fetched from their held `item`
-   Area Effect Clouds now store potions in the same format as the `minecraft:potion_contents` component in a `potion_contents` field:
    -   `Potion` -> `potion_contents.potion`
    -   `Color` -> `potion_contents.custom_color`
    -   `effects` -> `potion_contents.custom_effects`
-   Banners now store applied patterns in the same format as the `minecraft:banner_patterns` component in a `patterns` field:
    -   `Patterns[].Pattern` (string short id) -> `patterns[].pattern` (string pattern registry id)
    -   `Patterns[].Color` (integer dye id) -> `patterns[].color` (string dye name)
-   Beehive format has also been updated:
    -   `Bees[].EntityData` -> `bees[].entity_data`
    -   `Bees[].TicksInHive` -> `bees[].ticks_in_hive`
    -   `Bees[].MinOccupationTicks` -> `bees[].min_ticks_in_hive`
    -   `FlowerPos` -> `flower_pos`
-   Villager Trades can be configured to accept only undamaged items by selecting for `'minecraft:damage': 0`
    -   By default, if no components are specified, any item will be accepted (similar to `components` field in item predicates)

### Loot Item Functions

-   Added `minecraft:set_components` function
    -   Adds or replaces the given component on the input item
    -   `conditions`: list of conditions (default: `[]`):
        -   Conditions to check before applying the function
    -   `components`: map of component id to component value (format varied by id)
        -   Components with a `!` prefix (e.g. `"!minecraft:damage": {}`) will cause this component to be removed
-   Added `minecraft:copy_components` function
    -   Copies components from a specified source onto an item
    -   This is now used in the Vanilla pack in place of the `minecraft:copy_name` and `minecraft:copy_nbt` functions
    -   `conditions`: list of conditions (default: `[]`):
        -   Conditions to check before applying the function
    -   `source`: source type to pull from
        -   Currently, can only and must be `"block_entity"`
    -   `components`: list of component ids to copy
-   `minecraft:set_nbt` and `minecraft:copy_nbt` functions have been renamed to `minecraft:set_custom_data` and `minecraft:copy_custom_data` respectively
    -   These now apply to the `minecraft:custom_data` component of the target item
-   `minecraft:set_attributes` function has been updated
    -   The modifier `slot` field now supports `any`, `armor`, and `hand` values
    -   The modifier `operation` values have been renamed:
        -   `addition` -> `add_value`
        -   `multiply_base` -> `add_multiplied_base`
        -   `multiply_total` -> `add_multiplied_total`

### Predicate Formats in Loot Tables & Advancements

-   Item predicate format has been updated:
    -   `tag` field has been removed
    -   `items` field now supports a single entry, hash-prefixed item tag, or list of items
    -   `potion` -> `potions`, and supports a single entry, hash-prefixed potion tag, or list of potions
    -   `nbt` predicate has been renamed to `custom_data` and now matches `minecraft:custom_data` component
    -   A new optional `components` field matches exact components
        -   All specified components must be present an exactly equal on the target item, but additional components may be ignored
        -   Components with defaults will be assumed to exist on the target item if not specified
        -   Format: map of component id to component value (varies by component id)
            -   e.g. `"components": { "minecraft:damage": 0 }` will match only undamaged items
-   Block predicate format has been updated:
    -   `tag` field has been removed
    -   `blocks` field now supports a single entry, hash-prefixed block tag, or list of blocks

-   Location predicate format has been updated:
    -   `biome` -> `biomes`, and supports a single entry, hash-prefixed biome tag, or list of biomes
    -   `structure` -> `structures`, and supports a single entry, hash-prefixed structure tag, or list of structures

### Enchantments

-   Projectile weapon Enchantments like `infinity`, `multishot` and `piercing` now work on both Crossbows and Bows, if placed onto the alternative weapon using data manipulation or a change to the `enchantable/*` tags)

## Resource Pack Version 27
