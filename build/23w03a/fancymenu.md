-   Auto-Jump is now off by default
-   Added a new "Notification Display Time" accessibility option
    -   Changes how long notifications such as unlocked recipes, advancements, subtitles and selected item names are visible for

**Arrow key navigation**

-   Menu screens can now be navigated by using the arrow keys
-   When navigating with arrow keys, sliders need to be activated by pressing Enter or Space to start changing the value

## Technical Changes

-   New `execute` sub-commands

### Network Protocol

-   Clients now reset their Secure Chat session state when receiving the login packet

**Packet bundles**

-   Added new delimiter packet to clientbound game protocol
-   All packets between two delimiters are guaranteed to be processed within same tick
-   For security reasons this feature is not supported in serverbound direction

### Block Behavior

-   Fire burns out faster in certain biomes, and this is now controlled by the `increased_fire_burnout` biome tag

### Mob Spawning

-   The `only_allows_snow_and_gold_rabbits` biome tag has been renamed to `spawns_gold_rabbits` to match its behavior
-   White Rabbit variants are now controlled by the `spawns_white_rabbits` biome tag
-   Fox variants are now controlled by the `spawns_snow_foxes` biome tag

### Mob Behavior

-   Snow Golems melting in warm biomes is now controlled by the `snow_golem_melts` biome tag

### Commands

**`clone`**

The clone command now supports specifying the source and target dimensions. New syntax:

`clone [from <sourceDimension>] <begin> <end> [to <targetDimension>] <destination> ...`

Parameters:

-   `sourceDimension`: id of dimension to clone from
-   `targetDimension`: id of dimension to clone to

**`data`**

New source available:

-   `string <entity|block|storage> [path] [start] [end]` - reads a value as text, resulting in a string value

New arguments:

-   `start`: Index of first character to include at the start of the string
-   `end`: Index of the first character to exclude at the end of the string

**`execute`**

**`execute if|unless`**

New conditions available for the `execute if|unless` sub-command:

-   `execute if|unless loaded <pos>` - checks if the position given is fully loaded (in regard to both blocks and entities)
-   `execute if|unless dimension <dimension>` - checks if the execution is in a matching dimension

Parameters:

-   `pos`: Block position to check
-   `dimension`: A dimension id

**`execute on`**

New `execute` sub-command for selecting entities based on relation to the current executing entity:

-   `execute on <relation>`

Relations:

-   `vehicle` - entity that the executing entity is riding
-   `passengers` - all entities directly riding the executing entity (no sub-passengers)
-   `controller` - entity that is controlling the executing entity (for example: first passenger in a boat)
-   `owner` - owner of the executing entity, if it is a tameable animal (like cats, wolves or parrots)
-   `leasher` - entity leading the executing entity with a leash (might be a leash knot in case of being attached to a fence)
-   `target` - attack target for the executing entity
-   `attacker` - last entity that damaged the executing entity in the previous 5 seconds

If the relation is not applicable to the executing entity or there are no entities matching it, selector returns zero elements.

**`title`**

-   All time arguments to `title times` are now time durations and work with `t`, `s` and `d` suffixes

**`weather`**

-   The duration of the weather change now matches the game's regular weather cycle if not specified
-   The `duration` parameter is now a time duration in ticks and works with `t`, `s` and `d` suffixes
    -   To retain existing functionality, you need to add an `s` suffix to pre-existing commands

**`ride`**

New command to allow entities to start or stop riding other entities

Syntax:

-   `ride <target> mount <vehicle>`
    -   Makes a single target mount a single vehicle
    -   The command will fail if:
        -   `vehicle` is a player
        -   `target` is already riding a vehicle
        -   `target` and `vehicle` are the same entity
        -   `vehicle` is already a passenger (direct or indirect) of `target`
-   `ride <target> dismount`
    -   Dismounts `target` from any vehicle it is riding
    -   Fails if `target` is not riding anything

### Game Rules

-   Added `commandModificationBlockLimit`, controlling the maximum number of blocks changed in one execution of `clone`, `fill` and `fillbiome`

### Chat components

**Translation fallback**

Added an optional `fallback` field to `translate` text components.

-   The new field is a string that will be used in place of translation if it is missing
-   If `fallback` is missing, the old behavior (i.e. using the key itself as the translation) is preserved

## Experimental Features

### Note block interaction

-   Mob heads can now be placed on top of note blocks without sneaking
