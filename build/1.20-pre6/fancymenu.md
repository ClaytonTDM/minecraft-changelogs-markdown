# 1.20-pre6

The sixth pre-release of the 1.20 update is here, yet again containing more bug fixes.

Happy mining!

## Technical Changes

-   `"item": "minecraft:air"` can no longer be used in datapack recipes
-   Ingredients in array form are now also allowed in `smithing_trim` and `smithing_transform` recipes on fields `template`, `base` and `addition`
    -   Those fields also allow empty arrays, which signalize that slot needs to be left empty

### Loot tables

#### Random sequences

The ID of the random sequence is now an optional field. If no sequence name is given, loot is drawn using a non-deterministic random source.
