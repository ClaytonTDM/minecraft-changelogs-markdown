# Minecraft Snapshot 20w46a

The snow is snowier than before.

For today’s snapshot, we’ve changed most of the textures introduced in the previous snapshot. This is simply to test if these textures give a better experience in exploring and building. We’re interested to hear what you think. Keep in mind, that some textures might be reverted or changed again in the future

## New Features in 20w46a

-   Added Powder Snow!

### Powder Snow

Snowier snow!

-   Powder Snow is a trap block that causes any entity that walks into it to sink in it
-   You can pick up and place Powder Snow with a bucket
-   Wear leather boots to prevent yourself from sinking into Powder Snow blocks
-   Leave a Cauldron outside in falling snow and it will fill with Powder Snow

#### Freezing

-   Standing in Powder Snow will slowly freeze an entity
-   Once frozen, freeze damage is done every few seconds to the frozen entity
-   Each piece of leather armor warn causes an entity to freeze more slowly
-   Wearing a full set of leather armor prevents freezing entirely

## Changes in 20w46a

-   The range in which a lightning rod attracts lightning has been doubled
-   Copper blocks are now crafted from 4 copper ingots
-   Sky color now varies smoothly when moving between different biomes
-   Buttons that change value (like `Difficulty`) can now be controlled with mouse wheel
-   Clicking on button that changes value while holding shift key changes to previous value
-   "Debug" world type can now be accessed while holding alt key (was shift)

### Textures

Changed a number of the textures for blocks and items introduced in the previous snapshot:

-   Cut Copper
-   Lightning Rod
-   Calcite
-   Amethyst Block
-   Budding Amethyst Block
-   Tinted Glass
-   Candle Item Icons
-   Copper Ingot Item Icon
-   Amethyst Shard Item Icon
-   Bundle Item Icon

## Technical Changes in 20w46a

-   Removed `/replaceitem` command
-   Added `/item` command
-   Added item modifiers, which reuse loot table functions syntax to describe item modification in `/item` command.
-   Data pack version is now 7
-   Loot tables can now access scoreboard values by UUID.
-   Loot table values inside random number generators can now be nested.
-   Default mode of structure blocks is now `Load`. `Data` is now hidden (but can be accessed by clicking mode button while holding alt key)

### Item modifiers

The function part of loot tables can now be defined as separate data pack resource in `item_modifiers` directory. Such files can contain a single function (i.e single JSON object) or an array of functions.

### Commands

#### `item`

Modifies item or block inventory.

This command has three forms:

-   `/item <target> replace <item stack> [<count>]` - same as old `replaceitem`
-   `/item <target> modify <modifier>` - modifies item (without copying).
-   `/item <target> copy <source> [<modifier>]` - copies item for source to target(s), optionally applying modifier

Possible sources and targets:

-   `entity <selector> <slot>`
-   `block <x> <y> <z> <slot>`

For example, `/item block ~ ~ ~ container.0 copy entity @s enderchest.0` will copy first item from player's enderchest to first slot of container player is currently standing on.

### Loot tables

#### New conditions

##### `value_check`

Checks range of value.

Parameters:

-   `value` - see "New value providers" section (currently combination of random generators and score)
-   `range` - min/max range

#### Changed conditions

##### `score`

`entity` parameter has now been replaced with `target`. It can either contain value from old `entity` field (like `this`) or be an score holder name in form `{"name": "..."}`.

#### Changed functions

##### `set_damage`

This function now has `add` parameter. If `true`, change will be relative to current damage. If `false`, damage will be replaced with current value (default behavior)

##### `set_count`

This function now has `add` parameter. If `true`, change will be relative to current item count. If `false`, item count will be replaced with current value (default behavior)

##### `copy_nbt`

`source` parameter can now be set to `{"storage": <namespaced id>}`, to access command storage.

#### New functions

##### `set_enchantments`

Modifies enchantments on item

###### Parameters

-   `enchantments` - map of enchantment id to level value (can be score or random number)
-   `add` - if `true`, change will be relative to current level. If `false`, level will be replaced with current value (default behavior)

#### New value providers

Note: value providers can be used in same places as random number generators.

##### `score`

Returns scaled scoreboard value.

###### Parameters

-   `score` - scoreboard name
-   `target` - same as `target` in `score` predicate
-   `scale` - scaling factor (float)

### Data Packs

Changes to data packs for version 7:

-   Removal of `/replaceitem` (replaced with `/item replace`)
-   `score` loot table condition: `entity` parameter has been replaced with `target`

## Resource Packs

Changes to resource packs for version 7:

-   Drowned texture mirroring has changed (see MC-174685)
-   slots for the game mode selector are now 26 pixels instead of 25

Good things come to those who wait, and we've believe you've waited long enough. The first Caves & Cliffs snapshot is finally here and ready to enter the Java Edition of Minecraft! We hope that you're as excited about this as we are, because this snapshot brings you a variety of features, some changes to existing features, and a few technical changes. All of it is listed in this blog post, and we can't wait to see you experiment with it all.

Happy mining!

## New Features in 20w45a

-   Added bundles!
-   Added candles!
-   Added lava cauldrons!
-   Added Copper!
-   Added Amethyst!
-   Added Lightning Rod!
-   Added the Spyglass!
-   Added Tinted Glass!
-   A Shulker hitting a Shulker with a Shulker Bullet can make a new Shulker.

### Amethysts

#### Amethyst Blocks

-   Amethyst comes in block form inside the geodes in two ways: Block of Amethyst and Budding Amethyst
-   All types of Amethyst blocks (clusters included) create beautiful sounds when you walk on them, break them, place them, or hit them with a projectile - go make some music!

#### Amethyst Clusters

-   Amethyst Clusters grow from Budding Amethyst, which can be found inside geodes
-   Clusters have 4 growth stages: Small Amethyst Bud, Medium Amethyst Bud, Large Amethyst Bud, and Amethyst Cluster
-   Clusters can only grow when they are placed on Budding Amethyst blocks
-   Fully-grown Amethyst Clusters drop 4 Amethyst Shards (or more with Fortune) when an Iron Pickaxe or higher is used, and drop nothing otherwise when broken
-   Clusters can be Silk Touched at any stage

#### Amethyst Geodes

-   These huge geodes can be found anywhere underground in the overworld
-   Amethyst geodes have an outer layer of a new stone called Tuff
-   Amethyst geodes have a second layer of another new block called Calcite
-   Amethyst geodes have an inner layer of various Amethyst blocks

#### Amethyst Shards

-   Amethyst Clusters drop 4 Amethyst Shards (or more with Fortune)

#### Budding Amethyst

-   On any side of a Budding Amethyst block where there is air, or a water source block, a Small Amethyst Bud will eventually grow
-   Amethyst Buds can only grow when attached to Budding Amethyst, and will grow until they become Amethyst Clusters

### Bundles

-   Bundles are items that hold other items.
-   A bundle can hold a mixture of items, but only one stack’s worth. For example, a bundle could fit:
    -   64 dirt
    -   32 dirt + 32 stone
    -   32 dirt + 8 ender pearls
    -   1 of every color of wool, concrete, carpet and terracotta (64 blocks in total)
    -   Or 1 diamond helmet
-   Use right click to put an item into a bundle.
-   Right-click a bundle to empty it.
-   Wrap a present in a bundle and give it to your friend!

### Candles

-   Candles come in all 16 colors + 1 uncolored variant
-   Up to 4 can be placed in one block
-   Candles allow you to properly wish someone a happy birthday
-   Waterloggable! (But you cannot light them underwater, silly)
-   Wish anybody a happy birthday with a candle cake!

### Cauldrons

-   Cauldrons can now be filled with buckets of lava!
-   Filled lava cauldrons give off a redstone signal of strength 1

### Copper

#### Copper blocks

-   Craft 9 copper ingots to a copper block
-   Craft cut copper, cut copper stairs and cut copper slabs
-   Use honeycomb to craft waxed copper blocks

#### Copper ore

-   Copper ore can be found in ore blobs across Overworld, similar to iron and coal (this is not the final generation for copper…)
-   Smelt copper ore to get a copper ingot

#### Lightning Rod

-   The Lightning Rod is crafted from three copper ingots
-   Keep your builds safe (well, as long as the closest area around the lightning rod is fire proof) during thunderstorms!
-   The lightning rod will protect an area of 4 \* 16 blocks around it from the, sometimes devastating, lightning strikes!
-   Lightning rods give off a redstone signal when struck by lightning

#### Oxidation

-   Copper will oxidize over time
-   There are for stages: copper, lightly weathered copper, semi-weathered copper and weathered copper
-   It takes 50 - 82 Minecraft days (in loaded chunks) for a copper block to oxidize one stage
-   Waxed copper blocks will not oxidize
-   You can wax any oxidation stage - how lovely that means you can keep that pretty lightly weathered copper block in it’s lightly weathered stage forever!

### Spyglass

-   You can use your spyglass to see faraway things
-   Pretend to be a sea captain, or catch your neighbor in the act as they dye your sheep lime green
-   The spyglass is crafted from two copper ingots and one amethyst shard

### Tinted Glass

-   Tinted Glass is a type of glass that does not allow light to pass through
-   Tinted Glass is crafted by putting a Glass block in the middle of 4 Amethyst Shards
-   Tinted Glass can be obtained without silk touch; it does not shatter like normal glass

## Changes in 20w45a

-   Experience orbs now sometimes merge when in large quantities to improve performance. This does not change the rate at which the player can absorb them, it simply limits the amount of separate orbs floating around in the world. Orbs that merge will gain the lifetime of the most recently created one.
-   Simple firework rockets with 1 gunpowder can now be crafted using the recipe book
-   Dirt paths (formerly grass path) can now be made by using a shovel on dirt, podzol, mycelium or course dirt (as well as grass)
-   Minecarts and rails work in water
-   Particles now appear when pistons break blocks

### Minecarts

Minecarts and rails now work in water

-   All rails can be waterlogged (works with a dispenser & water bucket too)
-   Flowing water doesn’t break rails
-   Minecarts can pass through water, but get slowed down more than usual

## Technical Changes in 20w45a

-   Entities are now saved separately from terrain chunks.
-   Added loot table function set\_banner\_pattern
-   Pack format in version.json has been split into data and resource versions
-   Servers can now require custom resource packs to be accepted

### Custom server resource packs

A dedicated server can enforce custom resource packs by setting `require-resource-pack` in `server.properties`. When this option is used, players will be prompted for a response and will be disconnected if they decline the required pack.

### Entity storage

Entities have been extracted from main (terrain) chunks and are now stored in separate `entities` directory (similar to POI storage). Those new files are still region files with NBT.

### Loot tables

#### New functions

##### `set_banner_pattern`

Sets tags needed for banner patterns. Parameters:

-   `patterns` - list of pattern objects:
    -   `pattern` - name of pattern (`square_bottom_left`, `bricks`, etc.)
    -   `color` - name of color (`light_gray`, etc.)
-   `append` - if `true`, new elements will be appended to existing ones instead of replacing

Today we're releasing Snapshot 20w30a for Minecraft Java Edition in which we've tweaked Bastion Remnants, and given you the ability to have lanterns under water.

## Changes in 20w30a

-   Modified how respawn positions are chosen for beds and respawn anchors
-   Lanterns can now be waterlogged
-   Soul Lanterns can now be waterlogged
-   Tweaked the Bastion Remnant chest loot
-   Chests in Bastion Remnants are now more likely to be located on top of gilded blackstone

### Respawn Block Positions

-   Respawn anchors will prioritize cardinal directions over corners
-   Beds will prioritize the side of the bed the player entered from and then spaces circling around the foot of the bed up to the head of the bed
-   Respawning players will now face the block that they respawned at
-   Placing players onto dangerous blocks is now avoided when possible

## Technical Changes in 20w30a

-   The sign edit screen will now intialize from existing sign text (should have no noticeable impact on vanilla)
-   Tags can now have optional entries

### Optional Tag Entries

Entries in tags can now be marked as optional. Failure to resolve optional entries does not prevent the whole tag from loading.

Example:

    {
      "replace": false,
      "values": [
        "#minecraft:beds", // existing syntax
        { "id":"#missing:tag", "required": false }, // optional sub-tag entry
    "minecraft:anvil", // existing syntax
    { "id":"minecraft:stone_button", "required": true }, // new syntax for required tags
    { "id":"missing:block", "required": false } // optional single-element entry
