-   If component does not exist, it will not be added
-   Fields:
    -   `conditions`\- list of conditions to filter this function
    -   `component` - target component
        -   Allowed values: `container`, `bundle_contents`, `charged_projectiles`

    -   `item` - new item type

#### `filtered`

-   Applies sub-function only to items that match item predicate

### New Item Sub-predicates

General rules of component predicates:

-   Unless otherwise specified, a field in predicate with the same name as a field in component that matches (i.e. has the same name as predicate) will match that field value
-   Those fields will usually have the same type as in the components, but will be optional.
-   Exceptions:
    -   List fields will be replaced with collection matchers (see below)
    -   Integer and float fields will be replaced with ranges
    -   Registry ids will be replaced with a type that accepts id, list of ids or a tag

#### Collection matcher

Collection matcher is a shared part of predicate used for matching collections. Every instance of this matcher will have same fields with same functionality, with only difference being type of matched element Fields:

-   `size` - integer range to match against collection size
-   `contains` - a list of element predicates
    -   All conditions must match for predicate to pass
    -   Not all elements in tested container have to be matched
    -   Elements can be in any order
    -   Single element can match multiple predicates
    -   Examples (when matching item stacks):
        -   `{contents:[{item:diamond}]}` - will match when there is at least one diamond item
        -   `{contents:[{item:diamond}, {item:dirt}]}` - will match when there is at least one diamond item and at least one dirt item
-   `count` - a list of matchers on element counts
    -   Entry fields:
        -   `test` - element matcher
        -   `count` - optional integer range to check against number of elements passing `test`
    -   Examples (when matching item stacks):
        -   `{count:[{count:3,test:{items:diamond}}]}}` will match only when there are exactly 3 stacks of diamonds (no matter the stack size)

#### `container`

-   Matcher for `container` component (like shulker box)
-   Fields:
    -   `items` - optional collection matcher
        -   Note: empty items are ignored. That means `container~{items:{size:3}}` will only pass if there are exactly 3 non-empty stacks in container

### `bundle_contents`

-   Matcher for `bundle_contents` component
-   Fields:
    -   `items` - optional collection matcher

### `firework_explosion`

### `fireworks`

-   Matcher for `fireworks` component
-   Fields:
    -   `explosions` - optional collection matcher for `firework_explosion` predicates
    -   `flight_duration` - optional integer range check for flight duration
-   Example: `minecraft:fireworks~{explosions:{contains:[{shape:small_ball}]}}]` - matches if firework has at least one explosion with `small_ball` shape

### `writable_book_content`

-   Matcher for `writable_book_content` component
-   Fields
    -   `pages` - optional collection matcher for strings (matching only unfiltered contents of page)

### `fireworks`

-   Matcher for `written_book_content` component
-   Fields
    -   `pages` - optional collection matcher for chat components (matching only unfiltered contents of page)
    -   `author` - optional string value
    -   `title` - optional string value (matching only value)
    -   `generation` - optional integer range check for generation
    -   `resolved` - optional boolean

### `attribute_modifiers`

-   Matcher for `attribute_modifiers` component
-   Fields:
    -   `modifiers` - optional collection matcher for following entries with following fields:
        -   `attribute` - optional id, list of ids or tag for attribute to be matched
        -   `id` - optional UUID
        -   `name` - optional string
        -   `amount` - optional double range check
        -   `operation` - optional operation type (same values as `operation` field from `attribute_modifiers` component)

-   Fields:
    -   `material` - optional id, list of ids or tag for material to be matched
    -   `pattern` - optional id, list of ids or tag for pattern to be matched

### Particle representation

-   Particle options in commands and in fields like `Particles` in Area Effect clouds now use the same representation as worldgen files (like existing biomes' ambient particle settings)
-   For example, command `/particle minecraft:dust 1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 ...` becomes `/particle minecraft:dust{color:[1.0, 0.0, 0.0], scale:2.0} ...`
-   The syntax for particles without extra options (like `minecraft:villager`) remains unchanged
-   Changes to block particles (`minecraft:block`, `minecraft:block_marker`, `minecraft:falling_dust`, `minecraft:dust_pillar`) options:
    -   Field `value` has been renamed to `block_state`
    -   Field `block_state` now also accepts plain block name to represent default block state
    -   Example transformations:
        -   `minecraft:block minecraft:redstone_lamp[lit=true]` -> `minecraft:block{block_state: {Name: "minecraft:redstone_lamp", Properties: {lit: "true"}}}`
        -   `minecraft:block minecraft:diamond_block` -> `minecraft:block{block_state: "minecraft:diamond_block"}`
-   Changes to `minecraft:item` options:
    -   Field `value` has been renamed to `item`
    -   Field `item` now also accepts plain item name to represent item stack with default components
    -   `count` field is now ignored
    -   Example transformations:
        -   `minecraft:item minecraft:dirt` -> `minecraft:item{item: {id: "minecraft:dirt"}}`
        -   `minecraft:item minecraft:dirt` -> `minecraft:item{item: "minecraft:dirt"}`
-   Changes to `dust_color_transition` options:
    -   Field `fromColor` has been renamed to `from_color`
    -   Field `toColor` has been renamed to `to_color`
    -   Example transformation: `dust_color_transition 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.5 0.0 1.0 0.5` -> `dust_color_transition{from_color: [1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f], scale: 0.5f, to_color: [0.0f, 1.0f, 0.5f]}`
-   Changes to `entity_effect` options:
    -   Field `value` has been renamed to `color`
    -   Field `color` now also accepts list of floats representing RGBA color

We're bringing you the first Pre-Release of 1.20.3 with updates to server resource pack handling and bug fixes!

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 26
-   The Resource Pack version is now 22
-   Changes to downloaded/world resource pack handling

### World resource packs

Changes apply to world resource packs (`resources.zip`), Realms resource packs and resource packs controlled by dedicated servers.

#### UI

-   Download screen has been replaced with a toast
-   World resource pack application will start together with chunk loading

#### Local storage

Downloaded packs are now stored in `downloads` directory (with different file organization than old `server-resource-packs`)

-   Files in this directory are no longer automatically cleaned (previously only up 10 packs were kept)
-   Additionally, inside this directory there is also log file `log.json` that stores information about downloaded files for debug purposes

#### Server config

Downloaded packs now have unique id (GUID/UUID) that can be used to differentiate them

-   This value for dedicated server pack can be configured with `resource-pack-id` option in `server.properties`
-   If the value is missing, it will be generated based on URL
-   If hash of a pack is not set, this pack will be redownloaded before every application
    -   Previously, if hash was missing, latest downloaded version of pack was applied

#### Packets

Some additional options are added for 3rd-party servers software:

-   Client can now accept multiple server resource packs
-   New packet was added to un-apply server resource packs
-   Resource packs are no longer cleaned when entering configuration phase

## Data Pack Version 26

-   Renamed `minecraft:grass` block and item to `minecraft:short_grass`

## Resource Pack Version 22

-   Renamed `minecraft:grass` block and item to `minecraft:short_grass`
