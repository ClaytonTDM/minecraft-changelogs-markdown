# Minecraft Snapshot 20w21a

In this snapshot, we're adding support for custom world settings and custom dimensions. This is an early release to hear your feedback about this feature - do note that this support is considered experimental and unsupported. Any custom world settings may change from one snapshot to the next, and worlds using custom settings will be clearly marked as experimental in your worlds list. ​

## New Features in 20w21a

​

-   Added the ability to toggle redstone wire between a cross and a dot
-   Added import/export world settings functionality
-   Added a new disableMultiplayer command line option - when used, the Multiplayer button is disabled
-   Added a new disableChat command line option - when used, receiving and sending online chat is disabled

​

### Redstone Toggle

​

-   When right clicking a single piece of redstone, it toggles between a the cross and the dot
-   A dot of redstone will not power its surrounding blocks

​

## Changes in 20w21a

​

-   Piglins no longer walk around when admiring gold
-   If you hurt a piglin while it is admiring an ingot, the ingot will now disappear
-   Increased the chance of ores to generate in the Basalt Deltas to balance against the reduced amount of Netherrack in this biome
-   Lily pads are now considered junk fishing loot rather than treasure
-   Updated logos for Mojang Studios and Minecraft
-   Temporarily removed structure settings from flat level preset strings (workaround: use import/export settings functionality)

​

## Technical Changes in 20w21a

​

-   Added the ability to control the height of the `spreadplayers` command
-   Added custom worlds and custom dimensions

​

### Commands

​

#### `spreadplayers`

​ Added an optional argument to specify maximum height. New syntax: `spreadplayers <center> <spreadDistance> <maxRange> [under <maxHeight>] <respectTeams> <targets>` ​

-   `maxHeight` - Specifies the maximum height for resulting positions

​

#### `locate`

​

-   Structure names are now specified as lowercase

​

### Custom Worlds

​

-   Added experimental support for new custom worlds
-   Edit world screen now has an option to export world settings to a JSON file
-   During world creation you can import previously exported world settings
-   A bunch of new parameters are exposed, but marked as experimental, meaning you can play with them, but there is no guarantee that any of them will continue working (even in the next snapshot!)
-   Flat level preset string lost structure settings (they are now stored in a common format for all worlds), we will restore some form of this functionality soon
-   Buffet world can no longer be created from server.properties, flat level settings changed a bit; better support for custom world creation on the server is coming soon

This week we are releasing a bit of a smaller snapshot. However, if you're into switching game modes and completing advancements, this is right up your alley!

A small change has been made to this debug combination. ​

-   By default, using this key would return to Creative after toggling from Spectator. It now will toggle back to the previous game mode you had.

In this snapshot we made some changes to Redstone wire and we fixed a bunch of bugs.

## Changes in 20w18a

-   Redstone wire changes
-   The target block now conducts redstone signals

​

### Redstone wire

The blockstate, rendering and behavior of redstonewire are more in line with each other. Redstone will provide power to blocks on all sides it shows a visual connection to, and not do so on those sides without a visual connection. ​

-   A single redstone wire is now represented as a cross.
-   A wire on top of a block, which is redirected from below, will power the sides it is redirected to now. E.g. a fence gate above the redirecting wire will be powered.
-   Wires that redirect upwards to wires on non-conductive blocks used to only be redirected visually. Now this redirection applies to their behavior as well.
-   A wire that is redirected to go over a block will now always provide power to the block. This is most noticeable when the wire has signal strength 1.

​![Comparison between 1.15.2 and snapshot 20w18a](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/images/RedstoneChanges3_741x421.png)

## Technical Changes in 20w18a

-   Added a `enable-status` option to the server.properties file which if set to `false` will suppress replies to status requests from clients. This makes the server appear offline in the multiplayer screen.
-   Added control over how much entity data a server sends to clients
-   Advancement system changes

​

### Entity Broadcasting

It is now possible to control at what range the server sends data about entities to clients. ​

-   Added an `entity-broadcast-range-percentage` server property controlling how close entities need to be before being sent to clients. Higher values means entities are visible further away from players but cause more network traffic. Specifies percentage of default value, so for example `50` specifies half of the default range.

​

### Advancements

-   Added `player` check to every trigger (except `impossible`)
-   Entity checks in triggers can now use loot table condition syntax

​

#### Extended entity checks

Entity checks in triggers can now use loot table condition syntax. Old notation:

    {
      "trigger": "minecraft:player_killed_entity",
      "conditions": {
        "entity": {
          "type": "minecraft:blaze"
        }
      }
    }
    

is now equivalent to:

    {
      "trigger": "minecraft:player_killed_entity",
      "conditions": {
        "entity": [
          {
            "condition": "minecraft:entity_properties",
            "predicate": {
              "type": "minecraft:blaze"
            },
            "entity": "this"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    

**Note 1**: Like in loot tables, all conditions in top level array must be met for whole condition to trigger. ​ **Note 2**: To access new functionality, top level element must be JSON array. JSON object are interpreted as old notation.  
​ Full list of extended triggers:

-   New field `player` in every trigger
-   `bred_animals` - `parent`, `partner`, `child`
-   `channeled_lightning` - `victims`
-   `cured_zombie_villager` - `zombie`, `villager`
-   `fishing_rod_hooked` - `entity`
-   `killed_by_crossbow` - `victims`
-   `player_killed_entity` - `entity`
-   `entity_killed_player` - `entity`
-   `player_hurt_entity` - `entity`
-   `summoned_entity` - `entity`
-   `tame_animal` - `entity`
-   `target_hit` - `projectile`
-   `villager_trade` - `villager`

​

#### Miscellaneous trigger changes

-   Due to addition of `player`, existing contents of `location`, `slept_in_bed`, `hero_of_the_village`, `voluntary_exile` can now be placed in `location` field instead of top-level object. Old syntax is still supported, but depreciated.
