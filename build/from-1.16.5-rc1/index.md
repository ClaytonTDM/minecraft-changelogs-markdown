We have now released 1.16.4 Release Candidate 1. If no further critical issues are found, we expect this version to be the full release of 1.16.4 on Thursday.

## Changes in 1.16.4 Release Candidate 1

-   Added an option to hide matched names

### Hide matched names

-   Some servers send chat messages in non-standard formats. With this option on, the game will attempt to apply chat hiding anyway by matching the text in messages

## Fixed bugs in 1.16.4 Release Candidate 1

-   [MC-202614](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-202614) Search function in social interactions screen only finds names that begin with the letters that you typed in

Time for another pre-release! This time around we've fixed some issues with the new social interactions screen and we've also fixed some crashes.

In case you haven't heard, yesterday we announced that Mojang accounts will be migrating into Microsoft accounts. With this pre-release, we are preparing for that by having the game understand the settings and block-list of Microsoft accounts. You can read more about that over [here](https://www.minecraft.net/article/java-edition-moving-house), and you can find answers to questions you might have in the [FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/articles/360050865492). The FAQ will be continuously updated.

We aim to release 1.16.4 sometime during next week.

The first pre-release for 1.16.4 is officially out! ​ If you’ve been on the Internet for some time, you’ve probably noticed that you occasionally run into other players that you don’t get along with. To alleviate some of that frustration, we’re introducing a UI element called the “social interactions screen”, which will let you disable chatting with certain players, thus hiding any messages you receive from them. Additionally, the 1.16.4 update will contain some fixes for critical bugs, but other than that, this will be it for this dot-release. ​ Please help us out by testing the new UI and reporting any bugs you find on the [Minecraft Issue Tracker](https://aka.ms/snapshotbugs?ref=launcher). ​

## New Features in 1.16.4 Pre-release 1

​

-   New UI called Social Interactions Screen

​

### Social Interactions Screen

A new screen available in Multiplayer which shows a list of all players on a server so you can can hide chat from any player. ​

​

## Technical Changes in 1.16.4 Pre-release 1
