# Minecraft: Java Edition 1.16.5

Happy Friday! We're now releasing 1.16.5, which fixes two critical stability issues. We are not releasing more information about these issues at this time to protect servers that have not yet updated.

This release is network compatible with 1.16.4 - this means you do not need to upgrade your game right away to play on an upgraded server. However, we highly encourage all server owners to update as soon as possible to apply the stability fixes.

Next week, we aim to release the next snapshot of Caves & Cliffs. Stay tuned!

It's time for the 1.16.4 release! This release adds the new social interactions screen and fixes a few crashes.

If you missed it, we recently announced that Mojang accounts will be migrating into Microsoft accounts. This release prepares for that by having the game understand the settings and block-list of Microsoft accounts. You can read more about it over [here](https://www.minecraft.net/article/java-edition-moving-house), and you can find answers to questions you might have in the [FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360050865492), which will be continuously updated.

## Features in 1.16.4

-   New UI called Social Interactions Screen
-   A button to open a link to the Accessibility Guide can now be found in the Accessibility Options screen

### Social Interactions Screen

A new screen available in Multiplayer which shows a list of all players on a server so you can hide chat from any player.

-   Opens with a configurable key binding, by default P
-   Which players are hidden resets when you disconnect from a server

### Blocked Players

-   When logging in with a Microsoft account, players blocked in your account are now also blocked in the game, and account restrictions are now respected
