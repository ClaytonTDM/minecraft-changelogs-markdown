# Minecraft Snapshot 20w11a

In this snapshot you can be on your merry way across the beautiful Soulsand Valleys with your freshly enchanted boots. It's a bit scary to be fair, so these boots will help you out with that bit...

## Before we dive into this snapshot, a word about Redstone

Redstone is one of the coolest things in Minecraft and many of you are members of communities that focus on building mind-blowing redstone contraptions, farms, computing machines and 256x256 piston doors.

A lot of redstone behaviour is currently categorized as “undefined”. This is when the behaviour of the block is not the result of intentional code but is a side-effect of unaccounted edge cases or quirks in the game code.​

We know that many players consider undefined behaviour as a very interesting aspect of redstone and enjoy experimenting with and using undefined behaviour to build unique contraptions to share with the rest of the community.​

However, the quirks of undefined behaviour can be quite surprising - even when building simple contraptions. This quirkiness can be a negative experience for players new to redstone and may turn them away from this very unique and exciting aspect of Minecraft as well as the vast redstone community behind it.​

Our goal is to bring all redstone components up to a level of quality that we are happy with and we will be making adjustments where it makes the most sense for redstone going forward.

Any changes we make will be communicated in the snapshot changelogs and as always we will be reading your feedback and comments.

## Changes in 20w11a

-   TNT and Campfires will now ignite when hit by any burning projectile

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w10a

Today's snapshot is loud! It comes with a bunch of new ambient sound that adds some really nice flavour to the Nether biomes. Apart from this, you now have to use the smithing table to craft Netherite. Happy mining!

## New Features in 20w10a

-   Added crimson and warped hyphae – all-sided "stem" blocks including stripped variations
-   Use a smithing table to fuse the Netherite ingot with your diamond weapon/tool/armor
-   New ambient sounds for the Nether biomes

​

## Changes in 20w10a

​

-   Hoes are now more like other tools used to break blocks
-   Fish now despawn when further than 64 blocks away from the closest player
-   Updated netherite item textures

​

### Hoe Changes

​ We've made some changes to Hoes to make them more useful in the Nether. ​

-   Each tier has different speed at which Hoes mine blocks they are effective against
-   Hoes can now be enchanted with the following enchantments: Efficiency, Fortune, Silk Touch
-   Those enchantments can now be provided through the enchanting table.

​

## Technical Changes in 20w10a

​

### Entity UUIDs

​

-   UUIDs of the owners of projectiles, such as arrows or snowballs, are now stored as an array of four integers. All UUIDs will be stored in this format in the future

​

### New tags for item frames

​

-   `Invisible` - makes item frame invisible (item inside frame remains visible)
-   `Fixed` - prevents item frame from being broken and the item inside from being removed

​

### `target_hit` advancement trigger type

​ Conditions:

-   `signal_strength` matches the signal strength output from the block on hit

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w09a

Today is a sad day for Obsidian... It's crying. If you're not into crying you could always take aim at the new Target that we've added.

This update can also be found on [minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-20w09a).

If you find any bugs, please report them on the official [Minecraft Issue Tracker](https://aka.ms/snapshotbugs?ref=reddit).

## New Features in 20w09a

-   Added the Target Block!
-   Added new Crying Obsidian block! It's sad and it cries purple energy

### Target Block

Because let’s face it, your aim could use some practice

-   The closer you hit to the center, the larger the redstone signal!
-   Test your skills with a variety of projectiles, including eggs, snowballs, tridents, and more!
-   You will need one hay block and four redstone for this recipe

### Zombified Piglin

-   Zombie Pigmen are now known as Zombified Piglins, and they now have ears... or well, one at least

## Changes in 20w09a

-   Bartering loot has been restructured to be more appealing to Survival players
-   Crying Obsidian can now be obtained from Piglin Bartering
-   Entities now get pushed by flowing lava
-   Huge Fungi will now grow only on its matching type of Nylium
-   Can now place Warped/Crimson roots and fungi into pots
-   Nether wart blocks and warped wart block can be cleared quickly using a hoe
-   Weeping vines are now climbable!
-   Biome fog color smoothly blends between biomes. Smooth
-   Changed ambient block lighting in the Nether to be on parity with other editions

### Block Renames

Some blocks have been renamed. Turns out singular Fungus in the Nether attempted to falsely present itself as many Fungi - very sneaky!

-   Crimson Fungi is now called Crimson Fungus
-   Warped Fungi is now called Warped Fungus

## Technical Changes in 20w09a

-   New particle types: `dripping_obsidian_tear`, `falling_obsidian_tear`, `landing_obsidian_tear`
-   Piglins now have an `IsImmuneToZombification` data value that prevents them from zombifying in the overworld

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w08a

A wild snapshot appears! To tell you the truth, we hadn't actually planned to do a snapshot this week, but the Villagers were in dire need of neurosurgery.

## Fixed bug in 20w08a

-   [MC-172078](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-172078) All villagers with saved memory disappear when upgrading to 20w07a

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w07a

Ahh, a freshly baked snapshot! It undoubtedly smells better than the piglins that we just added...

## Features in 20w07a

-   Endermen can now pick up some of the new Nether blocks
-   Endermen will no longer pick up Netherrack
-   Gave Hoglins some actual functionality
-   Added Piglins
-   Netherite blocks can be used as the base of a beacon and Netherite ingots can be used as the fuel for a beacon. Weird flex but ok.

### Advancements

-   Piglins and hoglins are now required for Monster Hunter and Monsters Hunted

### Hoglins

-   Hoglins are big aggressive beasts that live in crimson forests in the nether
-   They attack players on sight, so be careful, they can easily knock you off a ledge!
-   Hoglins drop pork and sometimes leather, but not willingly
-   You can breed hoglins by feeding them crimson fungi, but do so at your own risk
-   Hoglins get hunted by piglins sometimes, but they don't go down without a fight!
-   Despite this, hoglins and piglin aren't enemies - they are more like an ecosystem
-   Baby hoglins like to pretend they are tough - but don't worry, they are more like angry puppies with no teeth
-   Want to keep hoglins off your back? Pro tip: Hoglins hate the smell of warped fungi!

### Piglins

-   Piglins are an aggressive civilization that live in the nether
-   They mostly hang around in the crimson forest, but you might find some in the nether wastes too
-   They think of players as target practice and will attack on sight
-   However if you dress appropriately they will see you as a respectable figure, or tolerable at least
-   Piglins are suspicious of strangers and if they see you opening a chest, or mining a block of gold, they will assume that you're stealing and will treat you accordingly
-   Piglins LOVE gold and get very distracted by gold items
-   Gold ingots are currency to piglins and you can throw ingots at them or right-click them with an ingot to barter for various goods
-   Piglins sometimes get hungry and hunt hoglins for food. Or they try at least. They results... vary.
-   Piglins prefer to hunt and fight in groups, and when a fight is happening everyone wants in
-   Piglins that somehow end up in the overworld become zombified fairly quickly
-   Piglins are creeped out by soul fire and zombified piglins, and will stay clear whenever possible
-   Wither skeletons are a historic enemy and piglins will attack on sight
-   Baby piglins are not as dangerous, but they can be mischievous so watch your back
-   ... and they like to play with baby hoglins
