# Minecraft Snapshot 20w17a

This week's snapshot brings you some tweaks, bugfixes, and technical changes!

We also have a survey up so that you can tell us what you think about the Nether Update. You can find it by clicking [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SF65G2F). We would very much appreciate if you could take the time and fill it out.

## New Features in 20w17a

-   Added an Entity Distance scale option ranging from 50% to 500%
-   Difficulty and game rules can now be changed from "Create World" screen

## Changes in 20w17a

-   Improved Smithing Table UI
-   Ruined portals now spawn less frequently
-   Renamed "Soul Fire Torch" and "Soul Fire Lantern" to "Soul Torch" and "Soul Lantern"
-   Tweaked Bastion Remnant loot
-   Walls now create posts under more things, like pressure plates and banners
-   The "Singleplayer" button will jump directly to "Create World" screen if there are no worlds to select

## Technical Changes in 20w17a

-   Block storage format in chunks slightly changed to speed up various tasks (rendering, pathfinding, world generation, etc).
-   Chat component style can now select font.
-   Full range of Unicode characters is supported (some may know what that means ðŸ˜‰)
-   Added the `attribute` command

### World save format

-   Saving `level.dat` now uses randomly-named temporary files (instead of using `level.dat_new` every time)
-   `player/*.dat` are now saved in a way similar to `level.dat` (including leaving `.dat_old` files)

### Block storage

`BlockStates` in `Sections` elements no longer contain values stretching over multiple 64-bit fields. If number of bits per block is not power of two (i.e. single 64-bit value can't fill whole number of blockstates) some bits will not be used. For example, if single block state takes 5 bits, highest 4 bits of every 64-bit field will be unused. That also means slight increase in storage size (in case of 5 bits, from 320 to 342 64-bit fields).

### Commands

**`attribute`**

Adds modifies attribute on single entity. Possible syntax: Parameters:

-   `attribute <target> <attribute> get [<scale>]` - get total value of attribute
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> base set <value>` - sets base valye
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> base get [<scale>]` - get base value
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> modifier add <uuid> <name> <value> add|multiply|multiply_base` - adds modifier (fails if modifier is already present)
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> modifier remove <uuid>` - removes modifier
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> modifier value get <uuid> [<scale>]` - get value of modifier
-   `target` - single entity (note: only players, armor stands and mobs have attributes)
-   `attribute` - name of attribute (like `minecraft:generic.max_health`)
-   `name` - string (in optional quotes) describing human-readable name of modifier
-   `value` - floating point value (note: certain attributes have limits on final value, so your change might not be noticeable)

### Chat components

**Hover event argument**

-   `style.hoverEvent` parameter now has parameter `contents`, with contents depending on type:
    -   For `show_text` - chat component
    -   For `show_item` - either item id or object with fields `id`, `count` and `tag` (with last one being serialized NBT)
    -   For `show_entity` - object with fields: `id` (UUID), `name` (chat component) and `type` (entity type resource location)
-   Old style `value` argument is now deprecated (but still supported)

**Colors**

`color` property can now contain RGB value prefixed by `#`. For example `#55ff55` will result in the same color as `green`.

**Custom fonts**

Chat component style now supports `font` property, which is resource location for font in resource pack. No entry is equivalent to `minecraft:default`.

### Fonts

-   `Force Unicode` option now switches between normal and alternative font (called `uniform.json`) - no reload needed

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w16a

Bastion remnants, or "home sweet home" as Piglins would call them, are finally here! This snapshot introduces the home of the Piglins. If you scour the world you might also find ruins of some old portals.

## New Features in 20w16a

-   Added Bastion Remnants!
-   Added Ruined Portals
-   Added chain blocks
-   Added a new music disc titled "Pigstep" by Lena Raine which can only be found in Bastions Remnants

### Bastion Remnants

What's made of Blackstone and full of piglins and hoglins? Bastion Remnants!

-   Added 4 separate Bastion Remnant types: Bridge, Hoglin Stable, Housing Units, and Treasure Room
-   You can find these sizable structures in all biomes in the Nether except the treacherous ash-dusted towers of Basalt Deltas
-   Explore, loot, and conquer a Bastion Remnant to call it your home...but beware, Piglins don't take kindly to intruders stealing their things

### Ruined Portals

Shattered remains of ancient nether portals. Wonder who built them?

-   They can be found in any overworld or nether biome
-   Some are hidden underground, under the sea, or buried in sand

## Changes in 20w16a

-   The piglin banner pattern can now be found in Bastion Remnants
-   Increased the amount of lava pools to make the deltas more "deltary"

## Technical Changes in 20w16a

-   Added a button in the GUI that generates a jigsaw structure starting from the jigsaw block, using given generation depth.
-   Expanded the max size per axis of Structure Blocks from 32 to 48
-   Added a JMX MBean to monitor dedicated server tick times

### JMX Monitoring

It is now possible to monitor the server tick times though JMX. The rationale for this is that JMX is a well known and supported monitoring technology with existing integrations and tools.

This enables server admins to hook alerts and graphing tools using ordinary JMX clients and dashboards.

**Enabling JMX Monitoring**

-   A new flag `enable-jmx-monitoring` has been added to the server.properties file which if set to `true` will expose an MBean with the Object name `net.minecraft.server:type=Server` and two attributes `averageTickTime` and `tickTimes` exposing the tick times in milliseconds.
-   In order for enabling JMX on the Java runtime you also need to add a couple of JVM flags to the startup as documented [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html).

## Fixed bugs in 20w16a

-   [MC-37557](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-37557) Sometimes a minecart sound plays/subtitle shown when loading a world
-   [MC-91163](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-91163) Certain subtitles show up when the player is too far away to hear the sound
-   [MC-154617](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-154617) Server hangs on stop due to rcon
-   [MC-171020](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-171020) New nether biomes don't work properly in buffet worlds
-   [MC-175919](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-175919) Villagers sometimes stop farming
-   [MC-177136](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-177136) All compasses and lodestone compasses point to the same target, regardless of what type of compass it is
-   [MC-177238](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-177238) Windows symbolic link in saves/ is no longer followed as of 20w14a
-   [MC-177253](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-177253) Running a set;;_;;attributes function throws java.lang.NullPointerException if it contains an undefined attribute
-   [MC-177316](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-177316) Lodestone compass in item frame does not update after turning
-   [MC-178368](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-178368) When rotating a lodestone compass is put in the item frame the compass don't work

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w15a

It's a wonderful day here in Sweden today! The sun is shining and spring is in the air, and when I say "spring" I mean **pollen**. Let's remedy that by 1) Staying indoors and 2) Introduce an all new biome with a grain of basalt, blackstone, and magma cubes! To spice it up, we also have some new fine tunes for you to listen to while traversing the Nether. Enjoy the snapshot!

## New Features in 20w15a

-   Accessibility improvements
-   Added a piglin banner pattern
-   Added Basalt Deltas biome to the Nether
-   Added soul campfires. Warm your buns with the heat of one thousand souls!

-   Added chiseled nether bricks, cracked nether bricks, and quartz bricks!
-   Added a new set of stone blocks called Blackstone with regular, polished, and polished brick variants!
-   Added Gilded Blackstone - Blackstone which has been imbued with gold and has a chance of dropping gold nuggets when broken
-   Blackstone can be used to craft furnaces and stone tools

### Accessibility

-   Added "Line Spacing" chat and accessibility option
-   Added "Chat Delay" accessibility option

### Basalt Deltas

Basalt Deltas can now be found in the Nether!

-   Remnants of volcanic eruptions, this biome sports a high concentration of Basalt columns and lava deltas
-   Walking through, you will be surrounded by flakes of flowing white ash
-   Magma Cubes finally have a place to call home, spawning very frequently
-   A new block, Blackstone, can be found in large patches here

### Nether Music

We're happy to announce that we've added three new tracks for the upcoming Nether Update, all composed by the very talented Lena Raine.

-   Rubedo will be played in the Nether Wastes
-   So Below will be played in Soul Sand Valleys and in Basalt Deltas
-   Chrysopoeia will be played in Crimson Forests

Some words from Lena:

-   "One of the primary instruments in Minecraft is the piano, and so one of my challenges to myself was to see how far I could push the sound of the piano until it resembled other things entirelyâ€“again, that alchemical process."
-   "I wanted each piece to feel like a progression of emotions, or a journey from place to place within this other world. There's a degree of beauty to the Nether, but it is also terrifying in both its details and scale."

Take a portal to the Nether, and stay awhile and listen...

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w14a

Even though we just added [every update imaginable to Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/article/every-update-imaginable-coming-minecraft), we thought that it might be good to pick up the Nether Update snapshots from where we left off. This snapshot introduces the Zoglins!

## New Features in 20w14a

-   Hoglins that somehow end up in the Overworld become Zoglins fairly quickly - but who would ever bring a Hoglin to the Overworld?
-   Compasses can now be enchanted with Curse of Vanishing

â€‹

### Zoglins

â€‹

-   Zoglins are zombified hoglins - the result of bringing a hoglin into the overworld
-   Unlike hoglins they can't be bred or fed, and they don't care about warped fungus
-   Beware - these beasts are raving mad and attack just about everything they see!

## Changes in 20w14a

-   The main menu background is now in the Nether
-   The General statistics list is now alphabetically sorted
-   Strider balancing

### Strider Balancing

-   Strider speed while mounted has been significantly increased to more closely resemble boat speeds
-   Warped Fungus on a Stick now has 100 max item damage, and only takes 1 damage per Strider consume
-   When Warped Fungus on a Stick is used with Striders, the boost is a great way to traverse the lava seas

â€‹

## Technical Changes in 20w14a

-   The compass now has `LodestonePos`, `LodestoneDimension` and `LodestoneTracked` data fields. If `LodestoneTracked` is zero, the game will skip checking for a Lodestone in the specified position.
-   Attributes are now added to game registry, similar to items, sound events, etc.
-   Region files are now opened in synchronous mode to increase reliability

â€‹

### Attributes

Attributes have been moved to game registry. That means few changes: â€‹

-   Items and entities will no longer keep unknown attributes
-   Names of some attributes have been renamed to meet resource location requirements

**Renames:**

-   `generic.maxHealth` ðŸ¡† `generic.max_health`
-   `zombie.spawnReinforcements` ðŸ¡† `zombie.spawn_reinforcements`
-   `horse.jumpStrength` ðŸ¡† `horse.jump_strength`
-   `generic.followRange` ðŸ¡† `generic.follow_range`
-   `generic.knockbackResistance` ðŸ¡† `generic.knockback_resistance`
-   `generic.movementSpeed` ðŸ¡† `generic.movement_speed`
-   `generic.flyingSpeed` ðŸ¡† `generic.flying_speed`
-   `generic.attackDamage` ðŸ¡† `generic.attack_damage`
-   `generic.attackKnockback` ðŸ¡† `generic.attack_knockback`
-   `generic.attackSpeed` ðŸ¡† `generic.attack_speed`
-   `generic.armorToughness` ðŸ¡† `generic.armor_toughness`
