Hello! This very technical snapshot contains vibration changes, data pack and resource pack changes, some network optimizations, new debug tools, and a some bug fixes. Enjoy!

## Changes

-   Changes to vibration mechanic

### Vibrations

-   Vibrations no longer risk being lost on simulation distance limit
-   Unequipping items emits a new `unequip` vibration of frequency 4
-   Chiseled Bookshelves emit a `block_change` vibration of frequency 11 when receiving books from Hoppers
-   Turtle Eggs cracking emit a `block_change` vibration of frequency 11
-   Turtle Eggs hatching emit a `block_destroy` vibration of frequency 12
-   Using Bone Meal emits an `item_interact_finish` vibration of frequency 3
-   Fire being doused by Water Potion emits a `block_destroy` vibration of frequency 12
-   Evokers evoking Vexes or Fangs emit an `entity_place` vibration of frequency 14
-   Carrots being eaten by Rabbits emit a `block_change` vibration of frequency 11
-   Sweet Berries being eaten by Foxes emit a `block_change` vibration of frequency 11
-   Camels eating Cactus emit an `eat` vibration of frequency 8

## Technical Changes

-   The resource pack version is now 17
-   A bug involving hunger icons was fixed in the slicer tool released with last snapshot. Here is [the new version](https://github.com/Mojang/slicer/releases/tag/v1.1.1)
-   The data pack version is now 17
-   Optimized networking to improve the experience on low bandwidth connections

### Resource Pack Version 17

-   The text field background is now a nine-sliced sprite at `widget/text_field` and `widget/text_field_highlighted`
-   The scroll bar in lists and text fields is now a nine-sliced sprite at `widget/scroller`

### Data Pack Version 17

-   Changed mob effect storage on items, entities and block entities

#### Mob effect storage changes

-   Game no longer uses numeric values when storing mob effects to world (so, for example, `4` becomes `minecraft:mining_fatigue`)
-   Various mob effect fields have been renamed for consistency with new structures

##### Mob Effect Instance

This structure is used in many places, so changes are described separately.

-   `Id` -> `id`, also changed from number to string id
-   `Ambient` -> `ambient`
-   `Amplifier` -> `amplifier`
-   `Duration` -> `duration`
-   `ShowParticles` -> `show_particles`
-   `ShowIcon` -> `show_icon`
-   `HiddenEffect` -> `hidden_effect`, also since it's mob effect instance, changes apply recursively
-   `FactorCalculationData` -> `factor_calculation_data`

##### Items

###### `potion`, `lingering_potion`, `splash_potion`, `tipped_arrow`

-   `CustomPotionEffects` -> `custom_potion_effects`, contents tranformed as a list of mob effect instances

###### `suspicous_stew`

-   `Effects` -> `effects`, for each entry:
    -   `EffectId` -> `id`, also changed from number to string id
    -   `EffectDuration` -> `duration`

##### Entities

###### `mooshroom`

-   Removed `EffectId` and `EffectDuration`
-   Added `stew_effects` with the same format as `suspicious_stew.effects` tag (i.e. list of effect id and duration)

###### `area_effect_cloud`

-   `Effects` -> `effects`, contents tranformed as a list of mob effect instances

###### `arrow`

-   `CustomPotionEffects` -> `custom_potion_effects`, contents tranformed as a list of mob effect instances

###### Players, Armor Stands and mobs

-   `ActiveEffects` -> `active_effects`, contents tranformed as a list of mob effect instances

##### Block Entities

###### `beacon`

-   `Primary` -> `primary_effect`, also changed from number to string id
-   `Secondary` -> `secondary_effect`, also changed from number to string id

#### Loot Tables

-   Added `sequence` loot function
    -   Contains 1 field:
        -   `functions`: an array of sub-functions to run in sequence
    -   Can also be declared as an inline array with out a type
        -   This matches the existing behavior where loot function JSON files can be declared as an array of composite functions
-   `all_of` predicates in loot tables can now be declared implicitly as an inline array without a type
    -   This similarly matches the existing behavior where loot predicate JSON files can be declared as an array of sub-predicates

### Network optimizations

-   Gameplay packets are now packed into bigger TCP-packets to reduce overhead from TCP-headers, significantly reducing network usage
-   Opening the debug screen with CTRL + F3 will now show charts for ping and received network traffic

### Secure Chat

-   Clients will no longer disconnect themselves when receiving an invalid chat message
    -   A placeholder message will instead be shown in chat
