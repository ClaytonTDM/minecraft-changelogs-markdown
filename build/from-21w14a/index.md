# Minecraft Snapshot 21w14a

A new snapshot is ready to be served, although somewhat… raw. Gordon Ramsey would be furious. Please don’t tell him, we don’t want to be called donuts. :(

Most of us have just gotten back from being off for a few days during Easter, so this snapshot is a bit on the smaller side.

## New Features in 21w14a

-   Added Raw Copper, Raw Iron and Raw Gold items
-   Tuff blobs can now be found between heights 0 and 16

### Smeltable Ore Drops

-   Ores that are smeltable now drop raw item forms of the ore instead of the ore block, and these can be smelted just like before
-   This is to prevent cluttering the inventory, and have consistency with Fortune on all ores
-   Ore blocks from old worlds and silk-touched ore blocks will continue to be smeltable

## Changes in 21w14a

-   Fully oxidized copper can now be waxed

An absolutely shocking snapshot arrives! This snapshot adds some new functionality to Copper, some general tweaks, a fancy new way of getting performance metrics, and a bunch of bugfixes.

Happy mining!

## New Features in 21w11a

-   Lightning rods can now, for the very first time ever, be waterlogged
-   New functionality for applying and removing wax from copper
-   Bonemealing rooted dirt now grows hanging roots underneath

### Waxing Copper and Oxidization

-   Right click with honeycomb on copper blocks to wax them
-   Use honeycomb in a dispenser to wax copper blocks
-   Axes can scrape off wax and oxidation of copper blocks
-   Lightning strike hitting copper will clean its oxidation

## Changes in 21w11a

-   Waxed copper blocks can be crafted into 4 copper ingots
-   Tweaked the cave sizes
-   Slightly increased the frequency of diamond ore blobs
-   Hanging roots block now renders randomly offset
-   Breaking a Big Dripleaf stem now drops a Big Dripleaf block
-   Moss blocks can be crafted with cobblestone or stone bricks to make the mossy versions of those blocks
-   The facing direction of Small Dripleaf blocks is now determined by which direction the player is facing when placing it
-   Fully-grown Amethyst Clusters now drop 4 Amethyst Shards (or more with Fortune) when mined with a pickaxe, and drop 2 Amethyst Shards when broken by hand, piston, or other means

## Technical Changes in 21w11a

-   Added F3+L shortcut to generate and persist performance metrics from in-game

### In-game client metrics reporting

Pressing F3+L while in the game will start a recording for 10 seconds capturing metrics such as tick durations, used heap sizes and other more detailed stats. These will be saved to a zip file in `debug/profiling/<yyyy-MM-dd_HH.mm.ss>.zip` and could be used for performance regression analysis if included in bug reports.

The exact metrics, output format and names are susceptible to change between versions, and our plan is to continue iterating on which metrics to capture.

A truly fabulous snapshot enters the arena! This snapshot brings fundamental changes to our rendering pipeline with the introduction of the brand new tech that is OpenGL Core 3.2. On top of that, we're finally introducing the Lush Caves biome. However, as with the Dripstone Caves, this is only available through creating a custom world.

There's an important note about this snapshot for those of you with older computers: With the introduction of OpenGL Core 3.2 there is a chance Minecraft Java will no longer run on computers that do not meet the [minimum system requirements](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360035131371-Minecraft-Java-Edition-system-requirements-). Computers that meet the [minimum system requirements](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360035131371-Minecraft-Java-Edition-system-requirements-) should not be affected.

## New Features in 21w10a

-   Added Lush Caves underground biome!
-   Added Cracked Deepslate Bricks and Cracked Deepslate Tiles
-   There is now an Infested variant of Deepslate found in the underground
-   While they will not generate in the world by default, Deepslate versions of copper, emerald and coal ores have been added for use by creators of maps and data packs

### Lush caves biome

The Lush Caves underground biome now exists for use in single-biome worlds. It does not yet generate in other world types.

-   Moss covers the floors and ceilings
-   Spore Blossoms grow from the ceiling and drip particles
-   Contains clay pools with dripleaf plants grow out of them
-   Contains azalea bushes and flowering azalea bushes
-   The azalea tree loves to have its roots in lush caves, so if you find an azalea tree (either overground or in a cave) you know there is a lush cave beneath you
-   Cave vines with glow berries grow from the ceiling and light up the caves

## Changes in 21w10a

-   Cobbled Deepslate can now be smelted into Deepslate.
-   Deepslate can now be placed along any axis
-   Lightning rods can now be waterlogged
-   Fossils in the deepest part of the underground generate with deepslate diamond ore instead of coal ore
-   Some ore textures have been updated

### Ore distribution

Overworld ore generation has been tweaked.

-   More emeralds in mountains
-   More lapis
-   Less copper, gold, and redstone
-   Smaller diamond blobs, but slightly more frequent. Less diamond ore overall though
-   Less iron, and it generates lower down
-   Reduced air exposure for coal

## Technical Changes in 21w10a

-   The game now runs using OpenGL 3.2 core profile
-   The maximum size that slimes can be summoned with is now 128
-   The `give` command can only give up to 100 stacks of items at a time (e.g. 6400 stone or 100 iron swords)

### OpenGL

Rendering is now using OpenGL 3.2 core profile. All fixed function rendering has been replaced with shader based rendering.

#### Shaders

Shaders are now included for all supported render states. Any shader except for the `blit` shader can also be replaced in resource packs. For now replacing these shaders is **not officially supported** and the way it works may change in the future.

The current rendering engine uses a system similar to the post processing shader pipeline. There are some differences between both system that cater to the slightly different requirements.

---

In this snapshot, our new beloved stone type has suffered a grim fate and has been renamed to Deepslate. How mysterious!

## Changes in 21w08a

-   Tweaked cave sizes further
-   Canyon and cave carvers now apply below y=0
-   Cracks can now be found carved into the ground
-   Grimstone has been changed into Deepslate

![Snapshot 21w08a texture comparison.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/images/snapshot-21w08a-texture-comparison.jpg)

### Deepslate

-   Grimstone is now called Deepslate
-   Deepslate now has a top texture, and a new block called Cobbled Deepslate drops from Deepslate
-   The cobbled variant is the same but without the top texture, and is used to craft all Deepslate variants instead
-   Deepslate now has a unique set of sounds! Very crunchy indeed

### Deepslate ores

-   Added Deepslate versions of iron, gold, lapis, redstone and diamond ores that generate wherever those ores replace Deepslate
-   Twice as tough to mine as normal ores

### Ore Distribution Tweaks

Hello, new snapshot! Hello, new cave generation!

Today's snapshot introduces a major change to how caves are generated within Minecraft. You could say that we're now introducing the cave part of Caves & Cliffs.

This is only the first step in our underground adventure, so please note that snapshots show features in early development and that there are two notable caveats with this snapshot:

-   You'll be unable to open old worlds in this snapshot as there is currently no upgrade path towards the new world height
-   All caves of the new type between y31 and y63 will be flooded with water

## New Features in 21w06a

-   Added noise caves and aquifers

### Noise caves and Aquifers

-   Noise caves are a new way of generating caves, providing more natural variety. They can get really huge sometimes! Noise caves come in two flavors:
    -   Cheese caves. Like the holes in swiss cheese. These often form caverns of various size.
    -   Spaghetti caves. Long squiggly tunnels, sometimes wide like tagliatelle.
-   No, they aren't loud. The "noise" part of noise caves is a technical term and has nothing to do with sound.
-   The old cave carvers and canyons still generate, combining with the noise caves to form interesting cave systems.
-   As with carvers, when noise caves intersect the surface they form cave entrances.
-   An aquifer is an area with local water level, independent of sea level. Aquifers are used during world generation to generate bodies of water inside noise caves. This sometimes results in large underground lakes!
-   For now, aquifers are only used below y31. This means all noise caves between y31 and sea level (y63) will be flooded with water, and noise cave entrances will essentially be lakes. This will be fixed later.
-   Magma sometimes generates at the bottom of underground bodies of water
-   Underwater cave carvers and underwater canyons have been removed, since aquifers are used to generate water in caves instead.

## Changes in 21w06a

-   Overworld build and generation limits have been expanded
-   Mineshafts adapted to larger caves
-   You can no longer crouch or jump to prevent a big dripleaf from tilting
-   A big dripleaf will now tilt rather than break when hit by a projectile
-   A redstone powered big dripleaf will not tilt (except when hit by a projectile)
-   The textures for hanging roots and small dripleaves have been updated

### World generation

-   Generation range and build limits have been expanded by 64 blocks up and 64 blocks down, to a total range of 384 blocks
-   Underground features, structures, and caves generate all the way down to y -64.

### Mineshaft changes

-   Mineshaft pieces don't generate if they would be fully floating in the air
-   Mineshaft corridors are supported by log pillars when needed
-   No floating cobwebs

## Fixed bugs in 21w06a

-   [MC-214346](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-214346) Big dripleaf can be broken with arrows in spawn protection
-   [MC-213813](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-213813) Small dripleaf can destroy any block

### Cave vines and glow berries

-   Cave vines grow down from the ceiling, like weeping vines
-   When they grow they have a chance of producing glow berries
-   Glow berries are a natural light source as well as a food source
-   Foxes eat glow berries
-   Use glow berries to plant new cave vines
-   Bonemealing a cave vine will create glow berries

### Dripleaf

-   Small dripleaf needs moisture, so it grows on clay or underwater
-   Small dripleaf grow into big dripleaf when bonemealed.
-   Big dripleaf grows taller when bonemealed
-   If you stand on a big dripleaf it will tilt after a while and you will fall off
-   You can crouch or jump to prevent a big dripleaf from tilting
-   A tilted big drip leaf will tilt up again after a while
-   The big dripleaf will break when hit by a projectile
-   The wandering trader will sometimes sell small dripleaf plants

### Moss

-   Two new decorative blocks: Moss block and moss carpet
-   Moss carpet can be crafted from moss blocks

### Spore blossom

-   A beautiful large flower placed on ceilings
-   Particles drip from it

## Changes in 21w05a

-   The stonecutter can be used to craft the different copper block variants
-   The stages of copper oxidization are now called "Copper Block", "Exposed Copper Block", "Weathered Copper Block" and "Oxidized Copper Block" in sequence of least to most oxidized
-   Drowned now have a chance of dropping a copper ingot, they no longer drop gold ingots
-   Added new sculk sensor events
-   Changes to powder snow

### Sculk Sensor Changes

-   `Mob Interact` is for specific mob interaction events that cause vibrations.
-   `Prime Fuse` is for both TNT and Creepers.

### Powder Snow changes

-   Flaming arrows now get extinguished when they collide with Powder Snow

Today's Caves & Cliffs snapshot is particularly shiny! You could almost say it's glowing... Oh wait, that's a squid.

## New Features in 21w03a

​

-   Added Glow Lichen!
-   Added the Glow Squid!

​

### Glow Lichen

-   A dim light source that generates in caves
-   Use shears to pick it up
-   Use bonemeal to spread it along block surfaces

Glow squids have been added, but do not yet spawn naturally. You can find spawn eggs for them in the creative inventory.

-   Glow Squids are well-lit and can be seen from even far distances!
-   When killed, Glow Squids drop Glow Ink Sacs
-   Glow Ink Sacs can be used on signs to make the text super visible, even at night! Works with colors!
-   Craft a Glow Item Frame by combining a Glow Ink Sac with an Item Frame in a Crafting Table. Any item in a Glow Item Frame is perfectly illuminated, even at night!
-   Use an Ink Sac on a sign to remove the glow effect
-   Axolotls will attack any Glow Squids they see, so...be careful
