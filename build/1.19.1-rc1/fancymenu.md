# Minecraft 1.19.1 Release Candidate 1

We're now releasing the first (and hopefully only) release candidate for Minecraft 1.19.1. We have also now created a help article on chat reporting, available [here](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/articles/7149823936781).

If there are no major issues following this release, no further changes will be done before the full release on Tuesday.

Happy mining!

## Changes in 1.19.1 Release Candidate 1

-   Updated the categories for chat reporting
    -   The "Profanity", "Nudity or pornography" and "Extreme violence or gore" categories have been removed
    -   The description for the "Drugs and alcohol" category has been updated to "Someone is encouraging others to partake in illegal drug related activities or encouraging underage drinking"
    -   The description of the "Harassment and bullying" category has been extended with the following: or posting private personal information about you or someone else without consent ("doxing").

## Technical changes in 1.19.1 Release Candidate 1

-   The `run_command` click event for text components no longer supports sending chat messages directly
    -   Only commands are supported, so a command such as `/say` should be used instead
    -   This means values now always need to be '/'-prefixed
-   Increased the amount of chat context sent with each chat report
