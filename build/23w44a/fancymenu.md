# Minecraft Snapshot 23w44a

In this week's Snapshot we're taking a break from new features to improve ones we've already added, including fixes to Commands and the ability to use Loot Tables with Decorated Pots.

## Changes

-   Copper Doors & Copper Trapdoors has updated textures

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 23

## Data Pack Version 23

-   Decorated Pots can now utilize loot tables and will read from the `LootTable` tag key
-   Additional changes to command functions

### Commands

#### `tick`

-   The `<time>` parameter in the `tick step` command is now optional. The default value is 1

#### `return`

-   `return run` will now always return
    -   If there are no valid results from returned command, function containing `return run` will fail (i.e. `success=0` and `result=0`)
-   `return run` will now propagate success value together with results value (previously it always set success to `1`)
-   `return run` now also allows storing values - that means `execute store ... run return run some_command` will both store value and return it outside function
-   New subcommand `return fail` is added to make whole function fail (i.e. return `success=0` and `result=0`)

#### `function`

-   If `function <function tag>` runs multiple functions in combination with `return run`, execution will stop after first `return` in any of the functions
-   A single call to the `function` command will always have return when run with `return run`
    -   For example, `return run execute [split context] run function <some function with conditional return>` will always return after processing the first context

#### `execute if|unless function`

-   `execute if|unless function` will no longer always fail if all functions had no return
    -   If there were no `returns` in called functions, `if` will fail and `unless` will pass
    -   First `return` in any of called functions will return (for a single context)
