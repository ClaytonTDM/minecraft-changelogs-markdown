# Minecraft 1.19.1 Pre-Release 3

Hi everyone,

Before we jump into today's pre-release, we would like to take a moment and dedicate some thoughts to a person who over the years has made an incredible impact on the Minecraft community and touched the lives of many. **Technoblade** became synonymous with a source of good – a positive force that time and time again made many, many people happy and someone we are proud to have as part of our giant family.

Minecraft is its community, which is why it should come as no surprise that so many of us mourn the loss of him, with tributes and love pouring in from across the world.

On behalf of the Java Team – thank you Technoblade for the memories, for all the fun and the laughter. You will be dearly missed. Our thoughts are with your family and friends.

* * *

Regarding 1.19.1: We still have a number of fixes in the pipeline, set for another pre-release in the near future. After that, once everything is tested and verified, we'll be aiming for a release candidate.

## Changes in 1.19.1 Pre-Release 3

-   The list of players on the Social Interactions screen now places entries for players with recently seen messages at the top of the list
-   The `msg_command` chat type has been split apart into `msg_command_incoming` and `msg_command_outgoing`
-   The `team_name` chat type parameter has been renamed to `target`
    -   This chat type parameter is now used by `msg_command_outgoing`

## Fixed bugs in 1.19.1 Pre-Release 3

# Minecraft 1.19.1 Pre-Release 2

Hey everyone! As a few of you might have noticed, we’ve made the decision to postpone the release of 1.19.1 and we're now going back into pre-release mode. This is in order to address a few of our more noticeable issues. We've yet to fully decide on a new release date, but it won't be too far in the future.

We’ve received a lot of feedback regarding the Player Chat Report feature, which is something we address specifically in a newly released post [here](https://www.minecraft.net/article/addressing-player-chat-reporting-tool), as well as in our [FAQ](https://aka.ms/chatreportingfaq) which hopefully answers all your questions!

## Changes in 1.19.1 Pre-Release 2

We've added the ability to see the signing status of chat messages – this is so you can easily tell when a server is tampering with, or removing the signing security of, their players' messages.

### Chat Trust Status

-   Messages that are not signed with the Secure Chat system, or have been tampered with by the server will now be marked
    -   Messages with missing or invalid signatures are marked as "Not Secure"
    -   Messages that are detected as modified are marked as "Modified"
-   The trust status of messages are displayed with both a colored indicator and an icon
    -   The colored indicator is always visible
    -   The icon is only visible when the chat screen is open
-   Hovering over the icon will provide more information about the trust status
    -   For modified messages, the original secure text will also be displayed in the tooltip

## Technical changes in 1.19.1 Pre-Release 2

### Chat Types

-   Chat types added to the `chat_types` registry are now only used for player chat, and not system messages
    -   The `system` and `game_info` chat types have been removed
-   Chat types have been simplified and are now only required to define `chat` and `narration` decorations
    -   Chat types no longer support overlays
    -   A system message should instead be used to display overlays

### server.properties

-   `enforce-secure-profile` is now defaulted to `true` for dedicated servers

## Fixed Bugs in 1.19.1 Pre-Release 2

-   [MC-253112](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-253112) The game output console is logged with warnings regarding chat packets with invalid signatures when using entity selectors within commands
-   [MC-253121](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-253121) Entities and other non-player chat message sources appear as players on the Select Chat Messages to Report screen
-   [MC-253493](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-253493) The descriptions of report categories can once again overlap the "Description:" subtitle
-   [MC-253495](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-253495) Selection boxes of fields within the "Select Report Category" menu list don't contain white outlines when selected using the TAB key
-   [MC-253497](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-253497) Entities and other non-player chat message sources appear in the Social Interactions menu
-   [MC-253501](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-253501) Long messages within the "Select Chat Messages to Report" menu can extend beyond selection boxes and past the scroll bar
-   [MC-253517](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-253517) Online players cannot connect to offline server because "invalid profile public key signature"

# Minecraft 1.19 Pre-Release 2

A recent change made it possible for more types of mobs to spawn inside Nether Portals, which caused them to instantly change dimensions after spawning. We will not be making any further changes to this before the release of 1.19, but our intent for the future is to prevent most mobs from spawning in Nether Portals and the ones that do will not immediately travel through the portal. Expect to see these changes in a coming version.

## Changes in 1.19 Pre-release 2

​

-   If the Warden is stuck in a liquid, it will angrily despawn instead of digging
-   Reverted using `generic equip` sound when equipping blocks in the head slot

## Technical Changes in 1.19 Pre-release 2

-   Added game event `teleport` with a vibration frequency of 5
