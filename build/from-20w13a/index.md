In this snapshot you can be on your merry way across the beautiful Soulsand Valleys with your freshly enchanted boots. It's a bit scary to be fair, so these boots will help you out with that bit...

## Before we dive into this snapshot, a word about Redstone

Redstone is one of the coolest things in Minecraft and many of you are members of communities that focus on building mind-blowing redstone contraptions, farms, computing machines and 256x256 piston doors.

A lot of redstone behaviour is currently categorized as “undefined”. This is when the behaviour of the block is not the result of intentional code but is a side-effect of unaccounted edge cases or quirks in the game code.​

We know that many players consider undefined behaviour as a very interesting aspect of redstone and enjoy experimenting with and using undefined behaviour to build unique contraptions to share with the rest of the community.​

However, the quirks of undefined behaviour can be quite surprising - even when building simple contraptions. This quirkiness can be a negative experience for players new to redstone and may turn them away from this very unique and exciting aspect of Minecraft as well as the vast redstone community behind it.​

Our goal is to bring all redstone components up to a level of quality that we are happy with and we will be making adjustments where it makes the most sense for redstone going forward.

Any changes we make will be communicated in the snapshot changelogs and as always we will be reading your feedback and comments.

Today's snapshot is loud! It comes with a bunch of new ambient sound that adds some really nice flavour to the Nether biomes. Apart from this, you now have to use the smithing table to craft Netherite. Happy mining!

## New Features in 20w10a

-   Added crimson and warped hyphae – all-sided "stem" blocks including stripped variations
-   Use a smithing table to fuse the Netherite ingot with your diamond weapon/tool/armor
-   New ambient sounds for the Nether biomes

​

## Changes in 20w10a

​

-   Hoes are now more like other tools used to break blocks
-   Fish now despawn when further than 64 blocks away from the closest player
-   Updated netherite item textures

​

### Hoe Changes

​ We've made some changes to Hoes to make them more useful in the Nether. ​

-   Each tier has different speed at which Hoes mine blocks they are effective against
-   Hoes can now be enchanted with the following enchantments: Efficiency, Fortune, Silk Touch
-   Those enchantments can now be provided through the enchanting table.

​

## Technical Changes in 20w10a

​

### Entity UUIDs

​

-   UUIDs of the owners of projectiles, such as arrows or snowballs, are now stored as an array of four integers. All UUIDs will be stored in this format in the future

​

### New tags for item frames

​

-   `Invisible` - makes item frame invisible (item inside frame remains visible)
-   `Fixed` - prevents item frame from being broken and the item inside from being removed

​

### `target_hit` advancement trigger type

​ Conditions:

-   `signal_strength` matches the signal strength output from the block on hit
-   `projectile` matches the projectile entity
-   `shooter` matches the player who shot or threw the projectile
