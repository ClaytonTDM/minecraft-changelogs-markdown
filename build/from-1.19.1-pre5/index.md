We are now releasing pre-release 5 for Minecraft 1.19.1. This pre-release includes the remaining fixes for a known exploit regarding player report context. It also fixes some other crashes and bugs.

## Changes in 1.19.1 Pre-release 5

### Chat

    -   The indicator will either appear to the left of the chat input field, or to the left of the chat preview if chat preview is being used
    -   The indicator will be green when the displayed message is signed
    -   The indicator will be orange when Chat Preview is enabled and a preview is waiting to be signed
-   The background of the chat preview will also display slightly faded when a preview is waiting to be signed

### Chat Preview

    -   To confirm sending a message, a second hit of the Enter/Return key is required
    -   The previous "ON" setting has been renamed to "On Modified"
-   The "On Modified" mode no longer displays previews if the message has not been modified by the server
-   Chat Preview is now enabled in singleplayer, and will display when using commands that have selector substitution such as `/say`

Hi everyone,

Before we jump into today's pre-release, we would like to take a moment and dedicate some thoughts to a person who over the years has made an incredible impact on the Minecraft community and touched the lives of many. **Technoblade** became synonymous with a source of good – a positive force that time and time again made many, many people happy and someone we are proud to have as part of our giant family.

Minecraft is its community, which is why it should come as no surprise that so many of us mourn the loss of him, with tributes and love pouring in from across the world.

On behalf of the Java Team – thank you Technoblade for the memories, for all the fun and the laughter. You will be dearly missed. Our thoughts are with your family and friends.

Hey everyone! As a few of you might have noticed, we’ve made the decision to postpone the release of 1.19.1 and we're now going back into pre-release mode. This is in order to address a few of our more noticeable issues. We've yet to fully decide on a new release date, but it won't be too far in the future.

We’ve received a lot of feedback regarding the Player Chat Report feature, which is something we address specifically in a newly released post [here](https://www.minecraft.net/article/addressing-player-chat-reporting-tool), as well as in our [FAQ](https://aka.ms/chatreportingfaq) which hopefully answers all your questions!

## Changes in 1.19.1 Pre-Release 2

We've added the ability to see the signing status of chat messages – this is so you can easily tell when a server is tampering with, or removing the signing security of, their players' messages.

### Chat Trust Status

-   Messages that are not signed with the Secure Chat system, or have been tampered with by the server will now be marked
    -   Messages with missing or invalid signatures are marked as "Not Secure"
    -   Messages that are detected as modified are marked as "Modified"
-   The trust status of messages are displayed with both a colored indicator and an icon
    -   The colored indicator is always visible
    -   The icon is only visible when the chat screen is open
-   Hovering over the icon will provide more information about the trust status
    -   For modified messages, the original secure text will also be displayed in the tooltip

## Technical changes in 1.19.1 Pre-Release 2

### Chat Types

-   Chat types added to the `chat_types` registry are now only used for player chat, and not system messages
    -   The `system` and `game_info` chat types have been removed
-   Chat types have been simplified and are now only required to define `chat` and `narration` decorations
    -   Chat types no longer support overlays
    -   A system message should instead be used to display overlays

### server.properties

-   `enforce-secure-profile` is now defaulted to `true` for dedicated servers

## Fixed Bugs in 1.19.1 Pre-Release 2

-   [MC-253112](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-253112) The game output console is logged with warnings regarding chat packets with invalid signatures when using entity selectors within commands
