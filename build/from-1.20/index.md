    -   Suspicious Sand can be found in Desert Temples, Desert Wells and Warm Ocean Ruins
    -   Suspicious Gravel can be found in Cold Ocean Ruins and Trail Ruins
    -   These fragile blocks are hard to spot and easy to destroy, so be careful!
    -   Brushing Suspicious Sand or Suspicious Gravel with a Brush will extract objects that were buried long ago
-   Added the Trail Ruins, a buried structure from a lost culture
    -   Four types of Armor Trim Templates can be found here
    -   Trail Ruins can be found in Taigas, Snowy Taigas, all Old Growth forest biomes and Jungles
    -   A new music disc can be found by brushing suspicious blocks in this structure
        -   When put in a Jukebox, "Relic" by Aaron Cherof is played
-   Added Pottery Sherds

    -   A total of 20 sherd have been distributed between the 5 Archaeology sites: Desert Wells, Desert Temples, Cold Ocean Ruins, Warm Ocean Ruins, and Trail Ruins
    -   They cannot be crafted, and are only found by brushing Suspicious Sand or Suspicious Gravel

#### Decorated Pots

-   Crafting four Pottery Sherds together will create a Decorated Pot with a picture on each side
-   Brick items can be used instead of Pottery Sherds in the Decorated Pot recipe
    -   The sides that were made from Brick items will not have pictures
-   Smash a Decorated Pot with any block-breaking tool to break it apart and get the Pottery Sherds back
    -   Hitting the pot with bare hands, silk touch tools, or any other item will drop an intact pot instead
-   Crafted Decorated Pots with at least one pattern have a hover tooltip displaying the Sherd & Brick ingredients

### Sniffer

-   The Sniffer is the mob vote winner of Minecraft Live 2022
-   Sniffers are passive, friendly mobs
-   Sniffers sniff the air and occasionally dig for seeds, which produces a Torchflower Seed or a Pitcher Pod item
-   Sniffers can only dig grass and dirt-like blocks
-   Sniffers can be tempted by, and bred with Torchflowers Seeds

#### Sniffer Egg

-   Can be found by brushing the Suspicious Sand of Warm Ocean Ruins
-   When two Sniffers breed they do not immediately spawn a Snifflet; instead, a Sniffer Egg is dropped
-   When placed in the world, the Sniffer Egg will hatch after some time
    -   When placed on Moss, the Egg will hatch in approximately 10 minutes
    -   On all other blocks, it will hatch in approximately 20 minutes

#### Torchflowers

-   The Sniffer can occasionally sniff up a Torchflowers seed, and it can be used to breed two Sniffers
-   The Torchflower seed can be planted on Farmland and grows into a Torchflower
-   The full-grown flower can be harvested and replanted
-   The Torchflower can be crafted into Orange Dye

#### Pitcher Plant

-   The Sniffer can occasionally sniff up a Pitcher Pod item
-   The Pitcher Pod, when planted on Farmland, grows into a Pitcher Crop
-   The Pitcher Crop has five growth stages
-   Once fully grown, the Pitcher Crop can be harvested, yielding a two-block-tall Pitcher Plant
-   The Pitcher Plant can be crafted into Cyan Dye

### Camel

-   Camels can be equipped with a Saddle and ridden by two players
-   Camels spawn naturally when Desert Villages generate
-   Camels can be tempted by holding Cactus
-   Feed Cactus to Camels to breed them
-   Camels are tall
    -   Most hostile mobs will not be able to reach you when you are on a Camel
    -   They can walk over Fences and Walls
-   Camels randomly sit down
    -   While sitting, it is difficult to convince them to move
-   Camels can either walk slowly or sprint quickly
-   They can also dash forward but will lose stamina for a while when doing so

### Smithing

-   Smithing Tables have been redesigned into a workstation for physical equipment upgrades and modifications
-   Alongside slots for combining a piece of equipment and materials, there is now a required slot for an item type called Smithing Template
-   Smithing Templates define what type of upgrade you will be making to a piece of equipment
    -   It specifies both what type of items you can upgrade, and which ingredients are valid to customize the upgrade
    -   There are currently two categories of Smithing Templates: Armor Trim and Netherite Upgrade
-   Smithing Templates are consumed when used to upgrade an item in the Smithing Table
-   You can craft a copy of a Smithing Template in the Crafting Table with 7 diamonds + 1 block of material that the template is made out of + 1 smithing template, which will output 2 of the same Smithing Template

#### Netherite Equipment

-   Netherite equipment crafting now also requires a Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template
-   Netherite Upgrade Smithing Templates can be found randomly in all Bastion Remnant chests
    -   Every Treasure Room Bastion Remnant will contain 2 Smithing Templates
-   This change was made for a variety of reasons:
    -   Increase the time players utilize Diamond equipment before Netherite
    -   Make Netherite equipment more significant achievement in the game's progression
    -   Adapt Netherite more naturally into the new Smithing Table crafting system

#### Armor Trims

-   You can now visually customize your armor with a variety of unique trims at the Smithing Table
-   Armor trims are purely visual with no gameplay benefits
-   Armor trims can be applied to Helmets, Chestplates, Leggings and Boots
    -   All trim patterns are visually the same on an armor's item icon, but the color will still change based on the trim material
    -   To check which trim pattern a piece of armor has, you can hover over it in the inventory
-   Armor Trim Smithing Templates can be found all throughout the world, and each of the following structures contain their own unique Smithing Templates:
    -   Trail Ruins: Wayfinder, Raiser, Shaper, and Host Armor Trims
    -   Pillager Outpost: Sentry Armor Trim
    -   Desert Pyramid: Dune Armor Trim
    -   Shipwreck: Coast Armor Trim
    -   Jungle Temple: Wild Armor Trim
    -   Ocean Monument: Tide Armor Trim
    -   Ancient City: Ward and Silence Armor Trims
    -   Woodland Mansion: Vex Armor Trim
    -   Nether Fortress: Rib Armor Trim
    -   Bastion Remnant: Snout Armor Trim
    -   Stronghold: Eye Armor Trim
    -   End City: Spire Armor Trim
-   Smithing Templates are found in chests in their respective structure
    -   Trail Ruins have no chests, Smithing Templates are instead found by brushing Suspicious Gravel
    -   The Ocean Monument has no chests, Elder Guardians sometimes instead drop a Smithing Template upon death
-   Some Armor Trim Smithing Templates are rarer than others, so be on the lookout for them to impress your friends!
-   An armor trim has two properties: a pattern and a material
    -   The pattern is defined by the Smithing Template used to apply the trim, and represents the visual pattern of the trim
    -   The material is defined by which ingredient you used to apply the trim, and controls the color of the trim
-   The viable ingredients you can use to define the color of your armor trim are the following:
    -   Iron, Copper, Gold, Lapis, Emerald, Diamond, Netherite, Redstone, Amethyst, Quartz

### Cherry Groves

-   Added a new Cherry Grove biome, with pretty cherry blossom trees
    -   The biome can be found in the mountains, in similar places as Meadows
-   Added a new Cherry wood set, with all the corresponding wooden things you can craft from it
-   Pink particles fall from beneath Cherry Leaves
-   Added a new Pink Petals block with lots of pink flowers on the ground
    -   Each Pink Petal block can contain up to 4 petals
    -   Using Bone Meal on it increases the number of petals
    -   Placing a Pink Petal into an already placed block increases the number of petals
    -   Drops the number of petals in the block when mined

### Bamboo Wood Set

-   Added a new Bamboo wood set, with all the corresponding wooden things you can craft from it
-   Block of Bamboo can be crafted from 9 Bamboo and can be stripped like other wood logs
-   Bamboo Planks crafted from Block of Bamboo yield only 2 planks compared to 4 for wood logs
-   Added a new "Mosaic" plank variant that is unique to Bamboo called the Bamboo Mosaic
    -   It can be crafted with 1x2 Bamboo Slabs in a vertical strip
    -   You can craft Stair and Slab variants of Bamboo Mosaic
    -   Bamboo Mosaic blocks cannot be used as a crafting ingredient where other wooden blocks are used, but they can be used as fuel
-   Added a unique Bamboo Raft and Bamboo Chest Raft which can be crafted like normal boats, but with Bamboo Planks
    -   They function the same as ordinary boats, but have a unique look to them

### Chiseled Bookshelf

-   A new, chiseled variation of the Bookshelf
-   Crafted with 6 planks and 3 wooden slabs
-   Can store Books, Book and Quills, Written Books, Enchanted Books, and Knowledge Books
    -   Holds up to 6 books
    -   These can be added or removed from any slot by targeting the specific slot
-   The Comparator signal strength corresponds to the number of the last book that was inserted or removed
    -   The numbering of book slots starts from 1 at the top-left, and increments from left-to-right
-   Works with Hoppers

### Hanging Signs

-   Hanging Signs are a more expensive version of normal Signs
    -   Crafted with 2 chains and 6 stripped logs of your preferred wood type
    -   Crafting results in 6 Hanging Signs
-   Can be hung up in the following ways:
    -   Underneath a block that can provide support in the center, like a full block or a fence
    -   Attached to the solid side of a block
    -   Attached to the side or underneath another Hanging Sign
-   Unlike normal Signs, they cannot be placed directly on the ground without support from the side or above
    -   However, Hanging Signs that have a horizontal bar will not pop when the supporting block is removed

### Signs

The following changes have been made for both Signs and Hanging Signs.

-   Sign text can now be edited after being placed in the world
    -   This can be done by interacting with the Sign
    -   Signs with non-text chat components can not be edited
-   Both sides of the Sign can now have separate text and colors, allowing for further customization options
    -   By default, a Sign will prompt you to input the front side's text when placed
    -   To apply text to the back-side, you must walk to the other side and interact with that face to edit it
-   Signs can now also be waxed with Honeycomb, preventing any further edits to its text
-   Opening the sign edit screen in singleplayer no longer pauses the game

### Calibrated Sculk Sensors

-   A new variant of Sculk Sensors that allows you to filter vibrations based on their frequency level
-   They are not found naturally and can only be crafted with 1 Sculk Sensor and 3 Amethyst Shards in the Crafting Table
-   One side of the Calibrated Sculk Sensor can receive a redstone signal as input
    -   The strength of that redstone signal is the only vibration frequency the Sculk Sensor will listen to
-   They have a combined active and cooldown phase that lasts 20 game ticks
    -   They output their redstone signal for the first 10 game ticks
-   They can detect vibrations up to 16 blocks away

### Vibration Resonance

-   Blocks of Amethyst have a new behavior when placed adjacent to Sculk Sensors
    -   If that Sculk Sensor receives a vibration, the Block of Amethyst will re-emit its frequency as a separate vibration at its location
-   This behavior is called Vibration Resonance, and allows players to move vibration frequencies across long distances without having to recreate the vibration naturally

### Playable Mob Sounds

-   When placing a Mob Head on a Note Block, that Note Block will now play one of the ambient sounds of that mob when played by a player or powered by Redstone
-   Mob Heads can be placed on top of Note Blocks without sneaking

### Piglin Mob Head

-   Piglins will now drop their heads when killed by a charged Creeper
-   Placing the Piglin head on a Note Block will play one of the Piglin's ambient sounds
-   The Piglin head will flap its ears when powered by Redstone, or when worn by a player while walking

### New Music

-   Added the following new music tracks by Aaron Cherof to Cherry Groves, Desert, Jungle, Badlands, and Flower Forest biomes:
    -   A Familiar Room
    -   Bromeliad
    -   Crescent Dunes
    -   Echo in the Wind
-   Added a new music disc with the track "Relic" by Aaron Cherof, found in Trail Ruins

### Windows Aarch64/ARM64 support

    -   Added the ability to scroll upwards by pressing the `up arrow` key
-   The game will now display a message box on startup if user enabled text-to-speech functionality, but it is not available
-   Removed Herobrine

### Sculk Changes

-   If a vibration is scheduled to be received by a Sculk Sensor or Sculk Shrieker, they will stay queued until all adjacent chunks are loaded and ticking
    -   Prevents vibration resonance setups from breaking when unloading their chunks from a distance
-   Waterlogging a Sculk Shrieker will now silence their shriek sounds
-   Sculk Sensors' default redstone output has been modified to be more reliable for distance calculations
-   Sculk Sensors and Calibrated Sculk Sensors now strongly power the block they are placed on
-   Both types of Sculk Sensors now stay in their Cooldown phase for 10 ticks, with other phase timings being adjusted to compensate

#### Sculk Sensor Phases

-   Sculk Sensors and Calibrated Sculk Sensors have three phases: Inactive, Active and Cooldown
-   The default phase is Inactive
    -   This phase lasts indefinitely until the block receives a vibration
    -   During this phase, the block is able to listen to nearby vibrations until one has been scheduled
-   When a scheduled vibration is received, the block switches to the Active phase
    -   This phase lasts 30 game ticks for Sculk Sensors, and 10 game ticks for Calibrated Sculk Sensors
    -   During this phase, the block stops listening to nearby vibrations, wiggles its tendrils and emits a redstone signal and light
-   After the Active phase has finished, the block switches to a Cooldown phase
    -   This phase lasts for 10 game ticks
    -   During this phase, the block keeps wiggling its tendrils, but no longer emits a redstone signal nor light
    -   Finally, once this phase is finished, the block will switch back to the Inactive phase
-   Previously, some of these phases had different timing values:
    -   Active: 40 game ticks for Sculk Sensors and 20 game ticks for Calibrated Sculk Sensors
    -   Cooldown: 1 game tick for both types of Sculk Sensors
-   These phase timings were tweaked so that it is less common for activated contraptions to recursively activate the Sculk Sensor that powered them

#### Vibration Frequencies

In preparation for the Calibrated Sculk Sensor, vibration frequencies have been greatly simplified to prevent unwanted interference. The following are category descriptions for each frequency and the expected events that they correspond to:

1.  Movement in any medium (land, water and air)
2.  Landing on any surface (land or water)
3.  Item interactions
4.  Gliding with an elytra or unique mob actions (Ravager roar, Wolf shaking, etc)
5.  Dismounting a mob or equipping gear
6.  Mounting a mob or interacting with a mob
7.  Mobs and players getting damaged
8.  Consuming items (drinking and eating)
9.  Blocks 'deactivating' (door close, chest close, button unpress, etc)
10.  Blocks 'activating' (door open, chest open, button press, etc)
11.  Blocks changing (cauldron water level rising, adding food to campfire, etc.)
12.  Blocks being destroyed
13.  Blocks being placed
14.  Mobs and players teleporting or spawning
15.  Mobs and players dying or an explosion

### Step Sounds

-   Walking on a block will now always play a step sound
    -   It was previously not the case if you were walking along the edge of a block with air or fluid besides it
-   Walking on the ocean floor will produce a step sound for the block you are walking on at a lower volume and pitch
-   When walking on Carpets, Snow, Nether Sprouts, Warped Roots, and Crimson Roots, a combination of step sounds will be played
    -   The top-most block you are walking on is played as normal
    -   The block underneath is played at a lower volume and pitch

### Advancements

-   Breeding Camels and Sniffers now count for "The Parrots and the Bats" and are now required for "Two by Two"
-   Hanging Signs now count for "Glow and Behold"
-   Visiting a Cherry Grove is now required for "Adventuring Time"

## Technical Changes

-   Improved performance of the light engine
-   The data pack version is now 15, accounting for sign data format, item display orientation and advancement changes
-   Removed `update_1_20` feature flag and built-in datapack - features are no longer experimental
-   Added a `return` command
-   Tweaked display entity interpolation
-   Added a `capped` rule structure processor that limits the number of replaced blocks for a structure piece to a configured maximum
-   Configuring block entity fields in a `rule` processor rule is now delegated to a referenced `block_entity_modifier` instead of the previously fixed `output_nbt` configuration
-   Random sequences for loot tables are now deterministic
-   Added a `reference` loot table function
-   Loot table condition/predicate changes:
    -   Renamed `alternative` to `any_of`
    -   Added `all_of`
-   Advancement trigger changes:
    -   Added `recipe_crafted`
    -   Changed format of `placed_block`, `item_used_on_block` and `allay_drop_item_on_block` triggers
-   Ingredients in array form are now also allowed in `smithing_trim` and `smithing_transform` recipes on fields `template`, `base` and `addition`
    -   Those fields also allow empty arrays, which signalize that slot needs to be left empty
-   Added new damage types: `outside_border` and `generic_kill`
-   Game events have changed vibration frequency and some have been removed
-   The resource pack version is now 15, accounting for the font and credits update
    -   Updated the sprite layout of `minecraft.png`
    -   Removed the overriding `minecraft.png` from the Programmer Art resource pack
    -   Updated the sprite layout of `invite_icon.png`
    -   `legacy_unicode` glyph provider has been removed
    -   Bitmaps used by `uniform` font have been removed
    -   `uniform` font has been updated to use Unifont 15.0.06
        -   That changes shape of multiple characters, while also adding support for new ones
        -   Combining characters no longer include circle overlayed over them (so M◌̆ now renders as M ̆)
    -   Added second level of organization of entries in credits.json on top of `titles`, called `disciplines`
-   Font textures are included in debug texture dump (F3 + S)
-   Added new font glyph providers: `unihex` and `reference`, removed `legacy_unicode`
-   Added support for Quick Play
-   Removed the `server` & `port` commandline arguments as their functionality has been replaced by Quick Play
-   Updates to telemetry
-   Changed encoding of `server.properties` to UTF-8
-   Added validation for symbolic links in world saves

### Light Engine

The light engine is responsible for calculating the brightness of each block in the world. Light is calculated during world generation as well as updated when a block is changed in the world. Behavior of the light engine has not been changed.

-   The performance of calculating light has been improved
    -   Reduces one source of lag spikes when crossing chunk borders
    -   Improves FPS in situations when a lot of light updates occur
    -   Improves how quickly chunks can be generated

### Commands

#### `return`

The `return` command can be used to control execution flow inside functions and change their return value. Effects:

-   Remaining separate top-level commands in the currently executing function (if any) are skipped
-   The result value of the `function` command that triggered the function is changed from the number of commands executed to `value`
-   The result value of the `return` command is also `value`

Syntax:

`return <value>`

Parameters:

-   `value`: An integer return value

#### `data`

-   `string` data sources now accept negative boundaries, which are interpreted as index counted from the end of the string

### Display Entity

#### Interpolation Changes

-   Previous values are always discarded if `interpolation_duration` is `0`
-   Made sure that render properties are applied at the same time (so `block_state` is applied at the same time as transformation, i.e. at the next tick after receiving an update)
-   Display entities are not rendered until their initial data is received. That means display entities might not be shown on the first tick.
-   Note: due to how the game handles updates, changes to entities made after summoning might be delivered to clients within a later tick

#### Rendering Changes

-   `item_display` items have been rotated 180 degrees around the Y axis to better match the transformation that is applied when rendering items on an Armor Stand head and in Item Frames
    -   For reference, the order of transformations applied to model (starting from innermost) is `item_transform`, rotate Y 180, `transformation` field, entity orientation (billboard option + `Rotation` field + `Pos` field)

### Structure post-processors

#### Capped post-processor

-   A `capped` post-processor has been added which can limit how many blocks a delegated post-processor randomly transform in a structure
-   This can be used to configure a structure piece to have an exact amount of specific blocks, instead of using random distribution
-   The `capped` post-processor has following required parameters:
    -   `delegate` A post-processor which performs the actual block transformation
    -   `limit` Maximum amount of blocks that the delegated post-processor can transform
        -   The blocks inside a structure are all randomly passed to the delegated post-processor until it has transformed the limited amount
        -   Either constant or random number generator sampled during post-processing

#### Rule post-processor block entity configuration

-   Previously a rule could specify an optional fixed `output_nbt` which would be added to the processed output block entity
-   This field has now been changed to reference a `block_entity_modifier`
-   Existing `block_entity_modifier`'s are:
    -   `passthrough` Retains existing fields on the block entity
        -   This is the default if no `block_entity_modifier` is specified
    -   `append_static` Similar to previous `output_nbt` this provides fixed fields to add to the block entity
        -   A minor change is that this modifier appends configured fields to the processed block instead of replacing existing fields
    -   `clear` Removes any existing fields on the block entity
    -   `append_loot` Appends a loot table and seed to the block entity through required parameter:
        -   `loot_table` Referenced loot table to add to block entity as `LootTable` field
        -   Field `LootTableSeed` is also added to the block entity using random seeded by block position

### Loot Tables

#### Random Sequences

The game now uses named random sequences to deterministically produce loot for loot tables. Each random sequence produces a unique sequence based on the world seed and sequence ID, which means a loot table will produce the same results when ran with the same parameters in the same world.

The ID of the random sequence to use for a loot table is specified in a new optional field called `random_sequence`. If no sequence name is given, loot is drawn using a non-deterministic random source.

#### `reference`

New function `reference` allows functions to call sub-functions (similar to `reference` condition).

Fields:

-   `name` - location of function to call

#### `any_of`/`all_of`

-   Loot condition `alternative` has been renamed to `any_of`
-   Added new loot condition `all_of` that passes only when all sub-conditions pass
    -   Has the same syntax as `any_of`

### Advancements

#### New Triggers

##### `recipe_crafted`

-   Triggered when crafting a recipe
-   Conditions:
    -   `recipe_id` - the resource location of the recipe crafted
    -   `ingredients` - an array of predicates for the item stacks used in the recipe
        -   A single item stack can only be used to fulfill one predicate
        -   Each predicate needs to be fulfilled to trigger the advancement. This allows for separation between recipes that have same identifier but use different ingredients.
        -   This field is optional. When not provided, or left empty, only the `recipe_id` will dictate the success of the trigger

#### Changed Triggers

-   All fields in `placed_block`, `item_used_on_block` and `allay_drop_item_on_block` have been collapsed into a single `location` field
-   The new `location` is similar to the `player` field - it is a list of loot conditions/predicates
-   All conditions in this list must match for a trigger to run
-   Conditions are evaluated in a new loot context called `advancement_location`. It has access to:
    -   Player as `this` entity
    -   Position of the placed block
    -   Block state of the placed/interacted block
    -   Held/used item as "tool"
-   Migration guide:
    -   Contents of old `location` field should be migrated to `location_check` condition
    -   Contents of `item` field should be migrated to `match_tool` condition
    -   Contents of `block` + `state` fields should be migrated to `block_state_property` condition

**Example** (from `make_a_sign_glow` advancement):

Before:

    {
        "conditions": {
            "item": {
                "items": [
                    "minecraft:glow_ink_sac"
                ]
            },
            "location": {
                "block": {
                    "tag": "minecraft:all_signs"
                }
            }
        },
        "trigger": "minecraft:item_used_on_block"
    }
    

After:

    {
        "conditions": {
            "location": [
                {
                    "condition": "minecraft:match_tool",
                    "predicate": {
                        "items": [
                            "minecraft:glow_ink_sac"
                        ]
                    }
                },

                            "tag": "minecraft:all_signs"
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        },
        "trigger": "minecraft:item_used_on_block"
    }
    

### Damage Types

-   Players outside the world border are now hurt by the damage type `outside_border` instead of `in_wall`
-   Forcibly removing an entity using the `/kill` command now uses damage type `generic_kill` instead of `out_of_world`

### Tags

#### Block Tags

-   Removed `replaceable_plants` since it was only used as a subset of the blocks for the tag above, and not as universally
-   Added `replaceable_by_trees` to better express blocks that are replaced when the tree grows through them
-   Added `replaceable` with all the blocks that can be replaced
    -   This tag only represents the internal state of the game, changing this tag does not make blocks replaceable
-   Added `sword_efficient` to represent blocks that are broken 50% faster by a sword than normal
-   Added `maintains_farmland` to represent which blocks will not cause farmland to be converted into dirt due to drying out when placed on top of it
-   Added `combination_step_sound_blocks` that controls which blocks produce a combination of step sounds

-   Added `enchantment_power_transmitter` to control which blocks are allowed between an Enchantment Table and a Bookshelf (or other Power Transmitter)
-   Added `vibration_resonators` to control which blocks transmit vibration signals when placed next to Sculk Sensors
-   Added `trail_ruins_replaceable` for blocks that Trail Ruins can replace when generating
-   Added `sniffer_diggable_block` to control which blocks Sniffers can dig
-   Added `sniffer_egg_hatch_boost` to that control on which blocks Sniffer Eggs hatch twice as fast
-   Added `ceiling_hanging_signs`
-   Added `wall_hanging_signs`
-   Added `all_hanging_signs`
-   Added `stone_buttons` block tag
-   Added `cherry_logs` block tag
-   Added `bamboo_blocks` block tag

-   Added `decorated_pot_ingredients`
-   Added `decorated_pot_sherds`
-   Added `sniffer_food`
-   Added `trimmable_armor`
-   Added `trim_materials`
-   Added `trim_templates`
-   Added `stone_buttons` item tag
-   Added `cherry_logs` item tag
-   Added `bamboo_blocks` item tag

### Game Events

-   Removed `piston_contract` game event in favor of `block_deactivate`
-   Removed `piston_extend` and `dispense_fail` game events in favor of `block_activate`
-   Many game events have new vibration frequencies:
    -   1: `step`, `swim`, `flap`
    -   2: `projectile_land`, `hit_ground`, `splash`
    -   3: `item_interact_finish`, `projectile_shoot`, `instrument_play`

    -   7: `entity_damage`
    -   8: `drink`, `eat`
    -   9: `container_close`, `block_close`, `block_deactivate`, `block_detach`
    -   10: `container_open`, `block_open`, `block_activate`, `block_attach`, `prime_fuse`, `note_block_play`
    -   11: `block_change`
    -   12: `block_destroy`, `fluid_pickup`
    -   13: `block_place`, `fluid_place`
    -   14: `entity_place`, `lightning_strike`, `teleport`
    -   15: `entity_die`, `explode`

### Fonts

#### New `unihex` Glyph Provider

-   New glyph provider for reading Unifont HEX files
    -   HEX format describes font glyphs using a bitmap
        -   The height of every glyph is 16 pixels
        -   The width of glyph can be 8, 16, 24 or 32 pixels
    -   Every line is made of two hexadecimal numbers separated by `:`
    -   The first value describes a codepoint - it must have 4, 5 or 6 hex digits
    -   The second value describes the glyph as a stream of bits, line by line
-   When rendering, empty columns on left and right side of glyphs are removed
    -   Custom glyph widths can be set with `size_overrides`
-   This provider requires two fields:
    -   `hex_file` - path to ZIP archive containing one or more `*.hex` files (files in archive with different extensions are ignored)
    -   `size_overrides` - list of codepoint ranges that should have width different from auto-detected (based on empty space in glyph). Fields:
        -   `from`, `to` - start and end of codepoint range (inclusive)
        -   `left`, `right` - integers describing the position of the left-most and right-most columns of the glyph in range
            -   Any bits in columns outside of this range will be discarded

#### New `reference` Glyph Provider

-   New glyph provider that can be used to include providers from other fonts
    -   Providers are guaranteed to be loaded only once, no matter how many times they are included
-   Provider has one field `id`, that describes another font to be included in the currently loaded one
    -   Inclusion is performed after all fonts are loaded, so it will include all providers for a given font defined in all datapacks

#### Removed `legacy_unicode` Glyph Provider

-   The `legacy_unicode` glyph provider has been removed
-   This functionality has been replaced by the `unihex` provider

### Quick Play

-   Added support for four new command line arguments that allow the game to be launched directly into a world
-   `quickPlayPath` takes a specified path for logging (relative to the run directory)
    -   If a path is provided the following will be logged upon joining a world:
        -   `type`: is either `singleplayer`, `multiplayer`, or `realms`
        -   `identifier`: represents the world you want to join
            -   For singleplayer, the folder name of the world
            -   For multiplayer, the IP address of the server
            -   For realms, the Realms ID
        -   `port`: represents the server port and is only logged for multiplayer
        -   `name`: The name of the world
        -   `gamemode`: The gamemode of the world
        -   `lastPlayedTime`: The time you joined the world
    -   Example:
        -   `--quickPlayPath "quickPlay/log.json"` will resolve into `.minecraft/quickPlay/log.json`
-   `quickPlaySingleplayer`, `quickPlayMultiplayer` and `quickPlayRealms` all take their respective `identifier`
    -   If one of these arguments is provided, the game will try to launch directly into the given world
    -   Examples:
        -   `--quickPlaySingleplayer "New World"`
        -   `--quickPlayMultiplayer "localhost:25565"`
        -   `--quickPlayRealms "1234"`

### Telemetry

#### All Events

-   Added new property: `launcher_name`
    -   This is set based on the `minecraft.launcher.brand` system property
    -   This will help us troubleshoot game launch related bugs more effectively, as we will be able to see whether the issue originated in the Minecraft launcher or a third-party program

#### Updated Required Events

-   `world_loaded`
    -   Added new property: `realms_map_content`
        -   When loading into a Realms Map Content world (Minigame), the `world_loaded` event will receive the name of that map
        -   This is to help us understand how Java Realms players interact with Java Realms adventure or minimap content

#### New Optional Events

-   `advancement_made`
    -   This event is triggered when a player completes an advancement, and allows us to see the advancement ID and the time when the advancement was completed
    -   This helps us as a studio understand player progress and limits, which informs our game design
-   `game_load_times`
    -   This event is triggered when the game client is loaded
    -   Includes the time it took for the client to load
    -   This is so that we can work on improving and reducing the time it takes to load the game client

### `server.properties`

-   File is now read in UTF-8 initially, with previous encoding (ISO 8859-1/Latin 1) as a fallback
-   File is now written with UTF-8 encoding

### Symbolic Link Validation

To improve safety, the game will now detect symbolic links used inside world directory. For a detailed explanation, check our [help article](https://aka.ms/MinecraftSymLinks).

-   If the target of a symbolic link is not on the user-configured allow-list, the game will not proceed with loading the world
    -   Note: the world directory itself can still be linked
-   The list of allowed symbolic link targets is stored in file `allowed_symlinks.txt` in the client or server top directory
-   The file consists of entries (one per line) with following formats allowed:
    -   Lines starting with `#` are comments and are ignored
    -   `[type]pattern`, where `type` can be `glob`, `regex` or `prefix`
        -   `prefix` matches start of path with given pattern (so for `/test` paths `/test`, `/test/` and `/test/foo.txt` would match)
        -   `regex` matches regular expression against whole path
        -   `glob` uses OS-specific path matching mechanism (for example `*.txt` would usually match files with `txt` extension)
        -   Note: paths will use OS-specific separators
    -   `pattern`, which uses default `prefix` type

### Commands

#### `clone`

The clone command now supports specifying the source and target dimensions.

New syntax:

`clone [from <sourceDimension>] <begin> <end> [to <targetDimension>] <destination> ...`

Parameters:

-   `sourceDimension`: id of dimension to clone from
-   `targetDimension`: id of dimension to clone to

#### `damage`

New command to apply damage to entities.

Syntax:

-   `damage <target> <amount> [<damageType>] [at <location>]`
-   `damage <target> <amount> [<damageType>] [by <entity>] [from <cause>]`

Parameters:

-   `target`: The entity to damage
-   `amount`: Amount of damage to inflict
-   `damageType`: The type of damage to inflict
    -   This determines how the damage affects the entity as well as which death message is displayed
-   `entity`: The entity inflicting the damage
-   `cause`: The cause of the damage, in the case of indirect damage
    -   Example: When shot by an Arrow, the `entity` is the Arrow projectile while `cause` might be a Skeleton
-   `location`: The location the damage originated at (when no entity caused the damage)
    -   For instance, `location` might represent the location of a Bed exploding in the Nether

#### `data`

New source available:

-   `string <entity|block|storage> [path] [start] [end]` - reads a value as text, resulting in a string value

New arguments:

-   `start`: Index of first character to include at the start of the string
-   `end`: Index of the first character to exclude at the end of the string

#### `effect`

-   `infinite` is now a valid option for effect durations
    -   Infinite effect durations show up as "∞" in the player inventory view

#### `execute`

##### `execute if|unless`

New conditions available for the `execute if|unless` sub-command:

-   `execute if|unless loaded <pos>` - checks if the position given is fully loaded (in regard to both blocks and entities)
-   `execute if|unless dimension <dimension>` - checks if the execution is in a matching dimension

Parameters:

-   `pos`: Block position to check
-   `dimension`: A dimension id

##### `execute on`

New `execute` sub-command for selecting entities based on relation to the current executing entity:

-   `execute on <relation>`

Relations:

-   `vehicle` - the entity that the executing entity is riding
-   `passengers` - all entities directly riding the executing entity (no sub-passengers)
-   `controller` - the entity that is controlling the executing entity (for example: first passenger in a boat)
-   `owner` - the owner of the executing entity, if it is a tameable animal (like cats, wolves or parrots)
-   `leasher` - the entity leading the executing entity with a leash (might be a leash knot in case of being attached to a fence)
-   `target` - the attack target for the executing entity
-   `attacker` - the last entity that damaged the executing entity in the previous 5 seconds
-   `origin`:
    -   shooter, if the executing entity is a projectile (like Arrow, Fireball, Trident, Firework, Thrown Potion, etc.)
    -   thrower, if the executing entity is an item
    -   source of effect, if the executing entity is an Area Effect Cloud
    -   igniter, if the executing entity is a Primed TNT
    -   summoner, if the executing entity is Evoker Fangs or a Vex

If the relation is not applicable to the executing entity or there are no entities matching it, the selector returns zero elements.

##### `execute positioned over`

New `execute` sub-command for finding positions on top of a heightmap. Changes the height of the execution position to be on top of the given heightmap.

Syntax:

-   `execute positioned over <heightmap>`

###### Heightmaps

A heightmap records the highest position in a column of blocks according to some criteria. Available options:

-   `world_surface`: Any non-air block
-   `motion_blocking`: Any motion blocking material (e.g. ignores flowers and grass)
-   `motion_blocking_no_leaves`: Any non-leaf motion blocking material
-   `ocean_floor`: Any non-fluid motion blocking material

##### `execute summon`

New `execute` sub-command for summoning a new entity and binding the context (`@s`) to it. Meant to simplify entity setup and reduce the need for raw NBT editing.

Syntax:

-   `execute summon <entity id>`

#### `fillbiome`

-   The amount of network data transmitted when using the `fillbiome` command has been optimized

### `title`

-   All time arguments to `title times` are now time durations and work with `t`, `s` and `d` suffixes

#### `weather`

-   The duration of the weather change now matches the game's regular weather cycle if not specified
-   The `duration` parameter is now a time duration in ticks and works with `t`, `s` and `d` suffixes
    -   To retain existing functionality, you need to add an `s` suffix to pre-existing commands

#### `ride`

New command to allow entities to start or stop riding other entities.

Syntax:

-   `ride <target> mount <vehicle>`
    -   Makes a single target mount a single vehicle
    -   The command will fail if:
        -   `vehicle` is a player
        -   `target` is already riding a vehicle
        -   `target` and `vehicle` are the same entity
        -   `vehicle` is already a passenger (direct or indirect) of `target`
-   `ride <target> dismount`
    -   Dismounts `target` from any vehicle it is riding
    -   Fails if `target` is not riding anything

### Damage Types

Damage Types are a new registry that can be extended through data packs. A Damage Type determines how damage is handled by the game. This includes which attributes the damage has as well as which death message is used when an entity dies due to that type of damage.

Example:

    {
      "exhaustion": 0.1,
      "message_id": "arrow",
      "scaling": "when_caused_by_living_non_player"
    }
    

Fields:

-   `message_id`: The message id used for deaths caused by this damage type
    -   Will be combined with other string fragments to form a translation key
-   `exhaustion`: The amount of hunger exhaustion caused by this damage type
-   `scaling`: Whether this damage type scales with difficulty levels. Possible values:
    -   `never`: Damage is always the same
    -   `always`: Damage always scales with difficulty
    -   `when_caused_by_living_non_player`: Damage scales with difficulty if it was caused by a living entity who is not a player
-   `effects`: Optional field controlling how damage manifests when inflicted on players. Possible values:
    -   `hurt` (default): the default hurt sound
    -   `thorns`: Thorns hurt sound
    -   `drowning`: Drowning sound
    -   `burning`: A single tick of burning sound
    -   `poking`: Berry bush poke sound
    -   `freezing`: Freeze tick sound
-   `death_message_type`: Optional field that controls if special death message variants are used. Possible values:
    -   `default` (default): No special death message logic is applied
    -   `fall_variants`: Show a variant of fall damage death instead of a regular death message, e.g. `death.fell.assist.item`
    -   `intentional_game_design`: Show the intentional game design message instead of a regular death message

Damage type tags control many aspects of how damage from different sources are interpreted.

### Predicates

#### Damage Type Predicates

The following fields have been removed from damage type predicates: `is_projectile`, `is_explosion`, `bypasses_armor`, `bypasses_invulnerability`, `bypasses_magic`, `is_fire`, `is_magic`, `is_lightning`.

A new `tags` array has been added, with the predicate matching if all entries match. Each entry has two fields:

-   `id`: The ID of a damage type tag
-   `expected`: Whether the damage is expected to have or not have the tag for the predicate to match

### Game Rules

-   Added `commandModificationBlockLimit`, controlling the maximum number of blocks changed in one execution of `clone`, `fill` and `fillbiome`
-   Added `doVinesSpread` game rule, determining if vines will spread to nearby blocks
    -   Defaults to `true`

### Text components

Added an optional `fallback` field to `translate` text components.

-   The new field is a string that will be used in place of translation if it is missing
-   If `fallback` is missing, the old behavior (i.e. using the key itself as the translation) is preserved

### Display entities

Three new entities have been added for flexible display of items, blocks and text

-   Those entities, similarily to `marker`, don't tick and have no collisions or physics
-   Models render at entity position, with normal rotation around X and Y axis (so it can be controlled by teleport commands), but also with additional arbitrary model transform

#### Common data types

Tag contents for display entities include some new data types with a complex structure. Any form can be used for modifying data, but only one form is used for saving.

##### Transformations

Arbitrary affine transform.

-   Matrix form: array of 16 numbers, describing row-major matrix
-   Decomposed form (used for saving): object with following fields:
    -   `translation` - 3d vector
    -   `left_rotation`, `right_rotation` - `rotation`
    -   `scale` - 3d vector
    -   Transforms are composed in order `translation`, `left_rotation`, `scale`, `right_rotation`

##### Rotations

-   Quaternion form (used for saving): array of 4 numbers, describing components (x, y, z, w)
-   Axis-angle form: object with following fields:
    -   `axis` - unit 3d vector
    -   `angle` - in radians

#### Interpolation

Some properties of display entities can be interpolated. That means that clients will see gradual changes over time instead of instantaneous jumps.

Display entities keep track of current and previous values of interpolated values:

-   All properties marked as "interpolated" are part of a single interpolation set
-   Any update to interpolated property will cause all values of interpolation set to be saved as "current"
    -   Data command executions that do not change value of property (even if it's present in NBT) do not count as updates
    -   Updates are synchronized to clients at most once per tick, so multiple updates within command will still count as a single update
-   The last values generated before an update are saved as "previous"
-   If interpolation is enabled, the entity will transition between "previous" and "current" values over `interpolation_duration` ticks
-   Interpolation can be started by writing to the `start_interpolation` field (this field is not normally present in NBT)
    -   The value in this field is a delay in ticks between client receiving the update and interpolation start
    -   A value of `0` ticks means that interpolation will start in next client tick after receiving the update
    -   Positive values increase this delay further
-   Interpolation will end (entity fully in "current" state) in `start_interpolation` + `interpolation_duration` ticks after receiving the update
-   The interpolation target can be updated without setting `start_interpolation`, but it will still behave as if it was started at the moment of the last update to `start_interpolation`
    -   That means that if the value is updated, but more than `interpolation_duration` ticks have passed since last `start_interpolation` update, the entity will immediately jump to new values

#### Common properties

All display entity types have the following fields:

-   `transformation` - the transformation applied to model (after normal entity orientation). Defaults to identity. Interpolated
-   `billboard` - option to control if entity should pivot to face player when rendered:
    -   `fixed` - no rotation (default)
    -   `vertical` - entity can pivot around its vertical axis
    -   `horizontal` - entity can pivot around its horizontal axis
    -   `center` - entity can pivot around its center point
-   `brightness` - if present, overrides light values used for rendering. Omitted by default (which means rendering uses values from entity position). Object has two fields:
    -   `sky` - value of skylight, 0..15
    -   `block` - value of block light, 0..15
-   `view_range` - maximum view range of this entity. Actual distance depends on client-side render distance and entity distance scalling. Default value 1.0 (roughly the same as fireball)
-   `shadow_radius` - size of shadow. Defaults to 0 (no shadow). Interpolated
-   `shadow_strength` - strength of the shadow. Controls the opacity of the shadow as a function of distance to block below. Defaults to 1. Interpolated
-   `width`, `height` - describe size of culling bounding box
    -   Bounding box spans vertically `y` to `y+height` and horizontally `width/2` in all directions from entity position
    -   If either field is set to `0`, culling is disabled
    -   Both default to `0`
-   `glow_color_override` - override glow border color. Defaults to `-1` (use team color). Alpha component is ignored

#### `item_display`

Displays a single item stack.

-   Stack can be changed with commands by setting slot `container.0`

Fields:

-   `item` - item stack to display. Same format as in inventory (example: `{id: "minecraft:dirt", Count: 1}`)
-   `item_display` - describes item model transform applied to item (as defined in `display` section in model JSON)
    -   Values: `none` (default), `thirdperson_lefthand`, `thirdperson_righthand`, `firstperson_lefthand`, `firstperson_righthand`, `head`, `gui`, `ground`, `fixed`

#### `block_display`

Displays a block state.

-   Does not display all block entities, even if they would normally be created on block placement (like chests)

Fields:

-   `block_state` - block state to display. Same format as item held by endermen (example `{Name:"minecraft:dirt"}`)

#### `text_display`

Displays a text component.

Fields:

-   `text` - text to display. Components are resolved with the context of the display entity
-   `line_width` - line width used to split lines (note: new lines can be also added with `\n` characters). Defaults to 200
-   `text_opacity` - opacity (alpha component) of rendered text. Defaults to 255. Interpolated
-   `background` - color of background. Includes alpha channel. Defaults to 0x40000000. Interpolated
-   `default_background` - if true, rendering uses default text background color (same as in chat). Defaults to false
-   `shadow` - whether the text should be displayed with a shadow. Defaults to false
-   `see_through` - whether the text should be visible through blocks. Defaults to false
-   `alignment` - how the text should be aligned
    -   Values: `center` (default), `left`, `right`

Note: text display backgrounds uses new shader types `rendertype_text_background` and `rendertype_text_background_see_through`.

### Interaction Entities

A new type of entity that records attacks ("left clicks") and interactions ("right clicks"). Interactions are invisible and of a custom size.

Fields:

-   `width`: Width of the entity's bounding box (default `1`)
-   `height`: Height of the entity's bounding box (default `1`)
-   `attack`: Records the last attack action on the entity
-   `interaction`: Records the last interaction action on the entity
-   `response`: Boolean specifying if interacting should trigger a response (arm swing, sound effects, etc - default `false`)

#### Action Format

When an action is stored, it always has two fields:

-   `player`: The UUID (in standard integer array format) of the player performing the action
-   `timestamp`: The timestamp of the game tick when the event happened (stored as a long)

#### Advancement Triggers

-   Interacting with an Interaction entity triggers `player_interacted_with_entity`
-   Attacking an Interaction entity triggers `player_hurt_entity`

#### `execute on` with Interactions

The Interaction entity targets the player who last interacted with it. That makes the following possible:

-   `execute on attacker`: execute as the last player who attacked the entity
-   `execute on target`: execute as the last player who interacted with the entity

### Tags

#### Block Behavior

-   Fire burns out faster in certain biomes, and this is now controlled by the `increased_fire_burnout` biome tag

#### Mob Spawning

-   The `only_allows_snow_and_gold_rabbits` biome tag has been renamed to `spawns_gold_rabbits` to match its behavior
-   White Rabbit variants are now controlled by the `spawns_white_rabbits` biome tag
-   Fox variants are now controlled by the `spawns_snow_foxes` biome tag

#### Mob Behavior

-   Snow Golems melting in warm biomes is now controlled by the `snow_golem_melts` biome tag
-   Only mobs in the `dismounts_underwater` entity tag will now force the rider to dismount when underwater

### Network Protocol

-   Clients now reset their Secure Chat session state when receiving the login packet

#### Packet bundles

-   Added new delimiter packet to clientbound game protocol
-   All packets between two delimiters are guaranteed to be processed within same tick
-   For security reasons this feature is not supported in the serverbound direction

### Paletted Permutations

-   `paletted_permutations` is a new type of atlas configuration source used to dynamically generate new textures in memory based on a set of color palettes
-   Color palettes allow you to swap out the colors of a texture without having to supply all files for the variants of a texture in a resource pack
-   This is useful for things like armor trims, where you want to be able to change the color of parts of the armor without having to create a new texture for each color
-   The `paletted_permutations` source has a set of required parameters:
    -   `textures` A list of namespaced locations of base textures
        -   These textures will be used to generate variants of them that have been modified by color palettes
    -   `palette_key` A namespaced location of a color palette key file
        -   A color palette key is used to define the set of key pixel colors we want to swap out with the color palettes defined below
    -   `permutations` A map of permutations from suffix to a namespaced location of a color palette file
        -   The suffix is appended at the beginning to the resource location of the output variant textures, with a `_` character separating the suffix and the base texture name
        -   The color palette is a texture file with a set of pixels that are used for replacing pixels that match the color palette key in each base texture
        -   The number of pixels in each color palette must be the same as that of the `palette_key` defined for this source
        -   Key matching is done by comparing the RGB values of each pixel in the `palette_key` to the RGB values of each pixel in the color palette
        -   The alpha channel is ignored for key matching, but in the resulting texture the alpha channel is multiplied with the color palette's alpha channel
        -   Pixels that do not match the `palette_key` are copied over to the resulting texture as-is
-   After defining a `paletted_permutations` source, you can then reference those namespaced output textures in other resources in your resource pack

For example, if you have the following `paletted_permutations` source:

    {
        "type": "paletted_permutations",
        "textures": [
            "minecraft:item/leather_helmet",
            "minecraft:item/leather_chestplate",
            "minecraft:item/leather_leggings",
            "minecraft:item/leather_boots"
        ],
        "palette_key": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/leather_armor_color_key",
        "permutations": {
            "red": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/red",
            "green": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/green",
            "blue": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/blue"
        }
    }
    

You can then reference the resulting textures in other resources like this:

    {
        "textures": {
            "layer0": "minecraft:item/leather_helmet_red",
            "layer1": "minecraft:item/leather_chestplate_green",
            "layer2": "minecraft:item/leather_boots_blue"
        }
    }
    

### Trim Patterns & Materials

-   Trim patterns and materials for armor are defined by the server through the `trim_pattern` and `trim_material` registry respectively
    -   As a result, new trim patterns and materials can be added via data packs
-   These are synchronized to clients when they join the server
    -   However, clients must have an accompanying resource pack to see those registered trim patterns and materials
    -   The paths to these textures are inferred based on the filename of the pattern json, and will try to find the textures within the same namespace as the trim pattern's `name` field
-   The following data is defined by a trim pattern:
    -   `asset_id` which is a namespaced id used to infer texture locations and localization
    -   `template_item` which is the id of the smithing template item used to apply the trim pattern
    -   `description` which is a text component used for displaying the pattern name of an armor trim when hovering an armor itemstack
-   The following data is defined by a trim material:
    -   `asset_name` which is a string used as a suffix for armor trim texture locations
    -   `ingredient` which is the id of the ingredient item used to apply the trim material
    -   `item_model_index` which is a float which defines the item model override each armor item model should target to change their visuals for this material
    -   `override_armor_materials` which is an optional map of armor material to overridden color palette
        -   Map key is the armor material that this trim material wants to override with a different color palette
        -   Map value is the name of the color palette that will be used when this trim material is applied to an armor piece with the corresponding armor material
    -   `description` which is a text component used for displaying the material name of an armor trim when hovering an armor item stack
        -   The style defined in this description is applied to the armor trim pattern `description` as well

## Experimental Features

The following changes only apply when one or more Experiments is turned on, either by activating the corresponding experimental data pack or by turning it on in the Experiments screen while creating the world.

-   Added Smithing Template items
-   Redesigned the Smithing Table
-   Changed how Netherite equipment is crafted
-   Added a new armor trimming system to visually customize your armor
-   Added Sniffer mob and Torchflowers
-   Added the Cherry Grove biome
-   Added Archaeology
-   Mob Heads can now be placed on top of Note Blocks without sneaking

### Smithing Templates

-   Smithing Tables have been redesigned into a workstation for physical equipment upgrades and modifications
-   Alongside slots for combining a piece of equipment and materials, there is now a required slot for an item type called Smithing Templates
-   Smithing Templates define what type of upgrade you will be making to equipment
    -   It specifies both what type of items you can upgrade, and which ingredients are valid to customize the upgrade
    -   There are currently two categories of Smithing Templates: Armor Trim and Netherite Upgrade
-   Smithing Templates are consumed when used to upgrade an item in the Smithing Table
-   You can craft a copy of a Smithing Template in the Crafting Table with 7 diamonds + 1 block of material that the template is made out of + 1 smithing template, which will output 2 of the same Smithing Template

### Netherite Equipment

-   Netherite equipment crafting now also requires a Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template
-   Netherite Upgrade Smithing Templates can be found randomly in all Bastion Remnant chests, and there is a guarantee of 2 in every Treasure Room Bastion Remnant
-   This change was made for a variety of reasons:
    -   Increase the time players utilize Diamond equipment before Netherite
    -   Make Netherite equipment a more significant achievement in the game's progression
    -   Adapt Netherite more naturally into the new Smithing Table crafting system

### Armor Trims

-   You can now visually customize your armor with a variety of unique trims at the Smithing Table
-   Armor trims are purely visual with no gameplay benefits, and can only be applied to Helmets, Chestplates, Leggings and Boots
    -   All trim patterns are visually the same on an armor's item icon, but the color will still change based on the trim material
    -   To check which trim pattern a piece of armor has, you can hover over it in the inventory
-   Armor Trim Smithing Templates can be found all throughout the world, and each of the following structures contain their own unique Smithing Template:
    -   Pillager Outpost: Sentry Armor Trim
    -   Desert Pyramid: Dune Armor Trim
    -   Shipwreck: Coast Armor Trim
    -   Jungle Temple: Wild Armor Trim
    -   Ocean Monument: Tide Armor Trim
    -   Ancient City: Ward Armor Trim
    -   Woodland Mansion: Vex Armor Trim
    -   Nether Fortress: Rib Armor Trim
    -   Bastion Remnant: Snout Armor Trim
    -   Stronghold: Eye Armor Trim
    -   End City: Spire Armor Trim
-   Smithing Templates are found in chests in their respective structure
    -   The Ocean Monument has no chests, Elder Guardians sometimes instead drop a Smithing Template upon death
-   Some Armor Trim Smithing Templates are rarer than others, so be on the lookout for them to impress your friends!
-   An armor trim has two properties: a pattern and a material
    -   The pattern is defined by the Smithing Template used to apply the trim, and represents the visual pattern of the trim
    -   The material is defined by what ingredient you used to apply the trim, and represents the color of the trim
-   The viable ingredients you can use to define the color of your armor trim are the following:
    -   Iron, Copper, Gold, Lapis, Emerald, Diamond, Netherite, Redstone, Amethyst, Quartz

### Sniffer

-   The Sniffer is the mob vote winner of Minecraft Live 2022
-   Sniffers cannot be tempted or tamed
-   Sniffers are passive, friendly mobs
-   Sniffers sniff the air and occasionally dig for seeds, which produces a Torchflower Seed
-   Sniffers can be bred by feeding them Torchflower Seeds
-   The Sniffer is currently only available as a Spawn Egg in the creative inventory

### Torchflowers

-   The Torchflower seed can be planted on farmland and grows into a flower
-   The seed can be used to breed two Sniffers
-   The full-grown flower can be harvested and replanted but can also be crafted into a dye

### Cherry Groves

-   Added a new Cherry Grove biome, with pretty cherry blossom trees
    -   The biome can be found in the mountains, in similar places as Meadows
-   Added a new Cherry wood set, with all the corresponding wooden things you can make from it
-   Cherry Leaves have pink particles falling underneath
-   Added a new Pink Petals block with lots of pink flowers on the ground
    -   Each pink petal block can contain up to 4 petals
    -   Using bone meal on it increases the number of petals
    -   Placing a petal on a block increases the number of petals
    -   Mining the block gives you the number of petals in the block

### Archaeology

#### The Brush

-   The brush is a craftable item you can use to brush things

#### Suspicious Sand

-   Can be found in Desert Temples and Desert Wells
-   This fragile block is hard to spot and easy to destroy, so be careful!
-   Brushing the Suspicious Sand with a Brush will extract objects that were buried long ago

#### Pottery Shards

-   Pottery Shards have pictures on them
-   They cannot be crafted and are only found by brushing Suspicious Sand

#### Decorated Pots

-   Crafting four Pottery Shards together will create a Decorated Pot with a picture on each side
-   Brick items can be used instead of Pottery Shards in the Decorated Pot recipe
    -   The sides that were made from Brick items will not have pictures
-   Smash a Decorated Pot with any block-breaking tool to break it apart and get the Pottery Shards back
    -   Hitting the pot with bare hands, silk touch tools, or any other item, will drop an intact pot instead

-   Game elements controlled by flags are hardcoded
-   Feature flags are stored in world

#### Configuration and datapack changes

-   Feature flags are enabled by datapacks
    -   New pack metadata section called `features` is added, containing enabled feature flags in list named `enabled`

### Commands

-   New command: `fillbiome`
-   New execute sub-command: `execute if|unless biome`
-   Improvements to the `publish` command

#### `fillbiome`

Changes biome entries for an area. Note that biomes are not stored per-block, so affected positions may not match input precisely.

Syntax:

`fillbiome <from> <to> <biome> [replace <filter>]`

Parameters:

-   `from`: One corner of the area to fill
-   `to`: The other corner of the area to fill
-   `biome`: The biome to set
-   `filter`: A biome or biome tag to replace

#### `execute`

Execute commands can now be conditional on biomes.

Syntax:

`execute if|unless biome <pos> <biome>`

#### `publish`

The `publish` command has new arguments to enable commands and set the default gamemode.

Syntax:

`publish [allowCommands] [gamemode] [port]`

### Telemetry

This release includes the WorldUnloaded event, a required event, as well as several opt-in events. Diagnostic tracking is a tool that helps us understand what you like about Minecraft, which allows us to make those things better.

The reason that WorldUnloaded, along with [WorldLoaded](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-21w38a), is a required event is that the information we’re looking at is, well, required. As a part of Xbox, we all need to follow a standard of practice, you can find a detailed description of it [here](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement). The parameters for what data we consider to be critical to our work are set by our team at Mojang Studios in alignment with Xbox.

What we want to find out is how fun you think Minecraft is. There are lots of ways to figure that out, like feedback, playtests, experience, and magic. We want to add data to that mix, which is where WorldLoaded and WorldUnloaded come in. WorldLoaded measures when you boot a session up, and WorldUnloaded measures when you shut it down. Together, they will measure how fun Minecraft is, using metrics such as playtime and the game modes that players choose to play. That’s it. All the data we collect, whether it’s required or opt-in, follows GDPR and CCPA best practices to keep your information safe.

The rest of the current telemetry events are opt-in, which means that you can choose whether or not you want to send us additional data. The only players that can’t opt-in are Microsoft child accounts, but everyone can still send in all of their feedback to [feedback.minecraft.net](http://feedback.minecraft.net/).

Just like all the thoughts and comments we get from you on our feedback site, this is something that greatly helps us improve Minecraft. We want to make a game that you want to play, so we want to know what that game needs. Even if it’s more lava.

#### Transparency

-   Added Telemetry Data Collection Screen
    -   This screen displays information about the type of data that is sent
    -   The level of data sent can be controlled between "Minimal" and "All"
        -   "Minimal" sends only the required data
        -   "All" sends the required data, as well as optional data
    -   The default data level is "Minimal" (only the required data)
-   Every telemetry event sent from the client is now logged to disk
    -   Old log files are removed after 7 days
    -   These can be found under the `logs/telemetry` directory
        -   A shortcut to this directory is available via the "Open My Data" button on the Telemetry Data Collection screen

#### Required events

-   Added WorldUnloaded event
-   Removed client Java version from the WorldLoaded event

##### WorldLoaded & WorldUnloaded

Understanding how Minecraft is played allows us to focus game updates and improvements on the areas that are most relevant to players. The data that tells us this includes game mode, client or server modded status, and game version.

WorldLoaded & WorldUnloaded are two paired events that calculate how long the world session has lasted (in seconds and ticks). Data from WorldLoaded is sent when a world is launched, and data from WorldUnloaded is sent when a world is shut down (quitting to title, disconnecting from a server).

#### Optional events

-   Added PerformanceMetrics and WorldLoadTimes events

##### PerformanceMetrics

Knowing the overall performance profile of Minecraft helps us tune and optimize the game for a wide range of machine specifications and operating systems.

The periodic performance metrics includes data such as frame-rates, rendering performance, memory usage, operating system, and the modded status of the client and server.

Game version is included to help us compare the performance profile for new versions of Minecraft.

##### WorldLoadTimes

It’s important for us to understand how long it takes to join a world, and how that changes over time. For example, when we add new features or do larger technical changes, we need to see what impact that had on load times.

This event includes the total time in milliseconds for the world to load, whether this was a new world, as well as game version and platform details.

### Game Rules

-   Added `blockExplosionDropDecay`, `mobExplosionDropDecay` and `tntExplosionDropDecay` game rules
    -   When set to `false`, all blocks drop loot
    -   When set to `true`, blocks drop loot randomly depending on how far from the explosion center
    -   Defaults to `false` for tnt, true for block and mob
-   Added `snowAccumulationHeight` game rule
    -   When it is snowing, this game rule determines the maximum number of layers can be accumulated in each block
    -   Defaults to `1`
    -   Set to `0` makes no snow form at all
    -   Set to `8` or above lets snow form up to the level of a full block
-   Added `waterSourceConversion` and `lavaSourceConversion` game rules
    -   When set to `true`, allows new sources of that fluid to form
    -   Defaults to `true` for water and `false` for lava
-   Added `globalSoundEvents` game rule, controlling whether certain gameplay moments are heard by all players regardless of location
    -   Defaults to `true`

### Recipes

#### Crafting book categories

-   Crafting book categories/tabs can now be controlled by recipe definitions
-   Categories available for `shaped`/`shapeless` and various special crafting recipes:
    -   `building`
    -   `redstone`
    -   `equipment`
    -   `misc` (default)
-   Categories available for `smelting`, `blasting`, `smoking`, `campfire_cooking`
    -   `food`
    -   `blocks`
    -   `misc` (default)
-   Some crafting books collapse multiple categories into a single tab
-   The exact mappings might change in the future

### Resource Packs

-   The Resource Pack version is now 12
-   Removed "fixers" for resource packs with versions 3 and 4 (pre-flattening)
    -   The game will no longer try to adapt packs with those versions to the current version
-   Game now loads all block models and blockstate definitions in appropriate directories
    -   That means that if a pack has invalid model it will prevent pack from loading, even if this model is unused

#### Texture loading changes

-   Context: When the game loads all textures used by block and item models need to be stitched (merged) into a single image, called the "atlas"
    -   Individual textures that are stitched onto the atlas are called "sprites"
-   To improve loading performance, block and item textures are now loaded before they are processed by block and item models
    -   By default, textures not in the `textures/item` and `textures/block` directories will no longer be automatically recognized and will fail to load
-   Resource packs can now have configuration files, located in `atlases` directory, that control which images are included in the atlases

##### Atlas configuration files

-   New directory `atlases` is now present for resource packs
-   This directory contains JSON entries for configuring atlases:
    -   `blocks` - textures used by block and item models
    -   `banner_patterns`, `beds`, `chests`, `shield_patterns`, `shulker_boxes`, `signs` - used to render some special-case models
    -   `mob_effects` - textures used for effect icons in the UI
    -   `paintings` - textures used for paintings
    -   `particles` - textures used for particles (referenced by the `textures` field in files within the `particles` directory)
-   If multiple packs include those files, they are merged by their order within the pack (same as tags in data packs)
-   Inside these files is a JSON object with a single list called `sources`
    -   Every entry in `sources` runs in during load, in order of definition, adding or removing new files to the texture list; to be later referenced by block models, particles, etc
-   Types of sources:
    -   `directory` - lists all files in a directory and its subdirectories, across all namespaces
        -   `source` - directory in pack to be listed (relative to `textures` directory)
        -   `prefix` - string to be appended to the sprite name when loaded
    -   `single` - adds a single file
        -   `resource` - location of a resource within the pack (relative to `textures` directory, implied `.png` extension)
        -   `sprite` - sprite name (optional, defaults to `resource`)
    -   `filter` - removes sprites matching the given pattern
        -   `namespace`, `path` - patterns (regular expressions, regex) of ids to be removed (only works for entries already in the list)
            -   If omitted, any value will be matched
    -   `unstitch` - copies rectangular regions from other images
        -   `resource` - location of a resource within the pack (relative to `textures` directory, implied `.png` extension)
        -   `divisor_x`, `divisor_y` - used for determining the units used by regions
        -   `regions` - list of regions to copy from the source image
            -   `sprite` - sprite name
            -   `x`, `y` - coordinates of the top-left corner of the region
            -   `width`, `height` - size of the region
        -   Values such as `x` are transformed to real image coordinates via dividing by their divisor, and then multiplying by the real image size
-   Example: if a pack has a file named `assets/test/textures/fancy/iridium.png` and source is `{"type": "directory", "source": "fancy", "prefix": "custom/"}`, the texture will be available in models as `test:custom/iridium`

### Custom Player Head Note Block sounds

-   Player Heads can now contain a `note_block_sound` field
    -   When present, this determines the sound a note block makes when the head is placed on top of it

### New entity sub-predicate types

-   Added new entity sub-predicates for some entity types with variants:
-   `axolotl`
    -   `variant` - values: `lucy`, `wild`, `gold`, `cyan`, `blue`

# Minecraft: Java Edition 1.19

Oh, hello. I didn’t see you there! I was too busy inspecting these mangrove tree roots. They’re all tangled up! What do you mean they’re supposed to be? Hey, that’s pretty neat.

-   In periodic pulses, will lower the overall brightness of the world so that the darkness creeps up towards light sources
-   The icon for the Darkness effect is only shown in the inventory
-   A new Accessibility slider has been added in your Options menu called “Darkness Effect”
    -   Controls strength of the Darkness lighting effect
    -   Does not affect the fog distance

### Music Disc 5

A new music disc has been added to the game

-   Unlike other discs, it can only be obtained by finding and crafting 9 Disc Fragments together
-   These Disc Fragments can be found rarely in Ancient City Chests

### Recovery Compass

A new Recovery Compass can be crafted with Echo Shards, another new item which can only be found in Ancient City Chests

-   Unlike a normal Compass, the Recovery Compass will point to the last place you died
-   If you are not in the dimension you last died, or you haven't died yet in your world, it will spin randomly
-   It can be crafted with 1 Compass surrounded by 8 Echo Shards, which can be found in Ancient Cities

### Swift Sneak

Imbue your leggings with this shiny new enchantment to move as fast while crouching as you would normally walk!

-   When applied, it will increase your movement speed while sneaking
-   Has 3 different levels with different speed increases
-   It is the first enchantment unique to leggings equipment!

### Sculk

The rattling tendrils of the Sculk Sensors had to come from somewhere, right? Introducing sculk, a new family of blocks that dwells in the Deep Dark. they find a valid substrate they can feed off of

-   Added Sculk Catalyst Block, a mysteriously soul-emitting block that blooms with Sculk patches underneath nearby dying mobs
    -   Mobs that perish in the presence of the Sculk Catalyst will not drop their experience
-   Added Sculk Blocks
    -   When a mob dies near a Sculk Catalyst, some unknown process seems to consume blocks beneath and turn them into Sculk Blocks
    -   A Sculk charge that spreads has a chance to consume some of its charge to grow a Sculk Sensor or Sculk Shrieker
    -   Sculk Blocks have very low blast resistance
-   Added Sculk Vein Blocks
    -   These veins are found on the edge of Sculk patches
    -   Similar to Glow Lichen, they can be placed in any orientation
    -   Spreading of veins causes other blocks to be taken over by the sculk
    -   Sculk Vein can spread underwater
-   Added Sculk Shrieker Block
    -   Sculk Shriekers can be found growing rarely from the charge of a Sculk Catalyst
    -   Sculk Shrieker can be waterlogged
    -   Notable for its boney appendages, this block responds to Sculk Sensors detecting vibrations by sending out a warning call to distant Wardens
        -   Watch out when stepping on them, as they will feel that too and send out a call!
    -   Initially it may take some time for a Warden to arrive, but you'll hear it responding in the distance...
    -   Once it's close enough, a call from the Sculk Shrieker will summon the Warden nearby - be prepared!
-   Souls from mobs will spread through Sculk Veins and Sculk Blocks in random directions until
    -   The charge from souls in the Sculk Blocks and Sculk Veins will eventually decay, but it will decay slower within close vicinity of the Sculk Catalyst and faster when further away from its host
    -   If the charge is dropped outside the range of the Catalyst, it has a chance of growing a Sculk Sensor
-   Sculk, Sculk Veins, and Sculk Catalysts require Silk Touch to acquire
    -   If mined without Silk Touch, they will drop experience instead
-   The efficient tool for all Sculk family blocks is the Hoe

### Warden

The horror of the Deep Dark! A creature with no eyes, roughly resembling the Sculk that can be found throughout the Deep Dark, the Warden is an unstoppable force of nature that inhabits this biome. Wardens are powerful creatures, and it is often better to sneak around one that has emerged instead of taking it head on - you have been warned.

-   Just like Sculk Sensors, these terrifying creatures use vibrations as a means to navigate their environment
-   When vibrations aren't enough, they will also use a sense of smell to track down their prey - you can observe them sniffing their surroundings to get closer to unsuspecting players and mobs
-   If something gets too close, it will be noticed
-   In the Deep Dark, Wardens can appear anywhere
    -   When enough Sculk Shriekers have been alerted to your presence, a Warden will appear
-   The more vibrations a Warden detects, the more angry it will get
    -   You can hear and see this from how fast the souls in its chest are beating
-   Once a mob has pushed beyond the Warden's anger threshold, it will face its prey and roar before charging
-   Building up high, hiding behind walls or being out of range of their powerful melee attack will cause Wardens to switch to their ranged attack
    -   Their rib cages will open up to shriek a sonically charged ranged attack that can penetrate walls
    -   This attack bypasses protection for armor and shield
-   If, however, you keep the Warden from noticing you or getting angry for 60 seconds, it will dig back underground and despawn
    -   If the Warden is stuck in a liquid, it will despawn instead of digging
-   They have a special interaction with thrown projectiles
    -   If the Warden receives two projectile vibrations within 5 seconds of one another, it will grow angrier at the shooter
    -   If the Warden receives a projectile vibration more than 5 seconds from the last projectile, it will not grow angrier at the shooter
    -   This allows you to strategically distract the Warden without it getting angry while you take loot from nearby chests
-   Wardens will also disable shields when they hit them with their fists
-   They drop a Sculk Catalyst upon death

### Changes to vibrations

-   Carpets, like Wool Blocks, will now dampen the vibrations caused by their placing, breaking, or dropping as items
-   Carpets now also dampen the vibrations caused by running and jumping over them
-   `item_interact_start` and `item_interact_finish` vibrations are ignored if sneaking

### Allay

-   Allays will collect all the surrounding items that match the item they are holding
-   Allays will like a player who hands them an item and will bring the items they collect to their liked player
-   If the Allay hears a Note Block play, that Note Block becomes the Allay's favorite Note Block for 30 seconds
    -   The Allay will stay near that Note Block for that duration and bring its collected items to Note Block instead of to the player
-   Interacting with an Allay with an empty hand will remove the item the Allay is holding
-   Allays can be found at Pillager Outposts and in Woodland Mansions
-   Allays are immune to damage from their liked player
-   Allays have a natural health regen of 2 health per second

### Boat with Chest

-   Lets you bring more stuff on your boat adventures
-   If you are in the Boat, press the open inventory key to access the Chest contents
-   If you are not in the Boat, sneak and use your interact key to access the Chest contents
-   If you break the Boat the Chest contents will spill out, like with other Chests
-   Also works with Hoppers, Droppers, and other blocks that interact with Chests
-   Like other Chests, opening a Boat with Chest or breaking the Boat will anger Piglins, since they think all Chests belong to them

### Goat Horns

-   A Goat Horn drops when a Goat rams a tree or any other hard block that occurs naturally where Goats spawn (Log, Stone, Packed Ice, Iron Ore, Copper Ore, or Emerald Ore)
    -   Other solid blocks are unfamiliar to the goat, so it won't ram them
-   Use the Goat Horn to play a loud sound that can be heard from afar
-   Each Goat Horn has its own sound based on the Goat it originated from
-   There are 8 Goat Horn variants, 4 of them exclusive to Screaming Goats
-   Goat Horns can sometimes be found in Pillager Outposts

### Advancements

-   Added "It Spreads" for killing a mob near a Sculk Catalyst
-   Added "You've Got a Friend in Me" for having an Allay deliver items to you
-   Added "Birthday Song" for having an Allay drop a Cake at a Note Block
-   Added "With our Powers Combined" for having all Froglights in your inventory
-   Added "Bukkit Bukkit" for catching a Tadpole in a Bucket
-   Added "When the Squad Hops into Town" for getting each Frog variant on a Lead
-   Added "Sneak 100" for sneaking near a Sculk Sensor or Warden to prevent it detecting you
-   Added Darkness effect to the "How Did We Get Here?" advancement

### Predictability of randomized events

Some randomized events are now more predictable and no longer have a possibility of extreme behaviors:

-   Placement and velocity of things dropped from Droppers/Dispensers
-   Placement and velocity of items spawned from containers upon destroy
-   Randomized `follow_range` component attribute for mobs
-   Velocity of Horses spawned from Skeleton Traps
-   Blaze random position and randomized speed of Blaze projectiles
-   Randomized portion of damage and velocity of Arrows
-   Randomized flight pattern of Fireworks
-   Bobbing patterns and time until a Fish appears for Fishing Rods

### Four new music tracks

-   The new music tracks are called Ancestry, Aerie, Firebugs, and Labyrinthine
-   They play in certain biomes

### Minecart variants

-   The recipes for minecart with Chest/Furnace/TNT/Hopper are now shapeless
-   When broken each Minecart variant drops itself as item, instead of splitting into two items (such as Chest and Minecart)

### Monster Spawning

-   Endermen, Skeletons, Wither Skeletons and Piglins now spawn in a wider range of light levels in the Nether (from light level 0 to 11)
    -   This makes it possible for more types of mobs to spawn inside Nether Portals, which causes them to instantly change dimensions after spawning
    -   Our intent for the future is to prevent most mobs from spawning in Nether Portals and the ones that do will not immediately travel through the portal - expect to see these changes in a coming version

### Advancements

#### New triggers

##### `allay_drop_item_on_block`

-   Triggered when an Allay drops an item on a block
-   Conditions:
    -   `player` - a predicate for the player who gave the Allay the item to collect
    -   `location` - a predicate for the block that the item was dropped on
    -   `item` - a predicate for the item that was dropped

##### `avoid_vibration`

-   Conditions:
    -   `player` - a player for which this trigger runs

##### `kill_mob_near_sculk_catalyst`

-   Triggered when a player kills an entity next to a Sculk Catalyst
-   Conditions:
    -   `player` - a predicate for the player killing the entity
    -   `entity` - a predicate for the entity that was killed
    -   `killing_blow` - a predicate for how the entity was killed

##### `thrown_item_picked_up_by_player`

-   Triggered when a player picks up an item that was thrown by an entity
-   Conditions:
    -   `player` - a predicate for the player picking up the item
    -   `entity` - a predicate for the entity that threw the item
    -   `item` - a predicate for the item

### Blending

-   Blending now supports 3D biome blending, which blends the underground biomes as well as the overground biomes
-   Removed `blending_data.old_noise`, now existence of `blending_data` in chunk data determines if a chunk is considered old
-   Added `blending_data.min_section` and `blending_data.max_section` that determines which section data that will be used for blending

### Chat Preview

-   Servers can enable Chat Preview by setting `previews-chat=true` in `server.properties`
-   Custom servers can enable or disable chat preview for certain clients by sending a new network packet
-   When enabled, a server-controlled preview appears above the chat edit box, showing how the message will look when sent
    -   A preview is also shown for chat-related commands, such as `/say` and `/msg`
-   This can be used by servers to preview messages with styling applied, such as emojis or chat coloring
-   Chat Preview sends chat messages to the server as they are typed, even before they're sent
    -   The server then sends back the styled preview in real time
    -   This allows servers to apply dynamic message stylings while still allowing chat to be securely signed
-   A warning screen is shown on the client when joining a server with Chat Preview, and it can be globally disabled in Chat Settings

### Chat Types

-   Different chat style formats can now be controlled by the server through the `chat_type` registry
    -   These are synchronized to clients when they join the server
    -   The translation key or translation format can be defined, like `chat.type.text` or `%s says: "%s"`
        -   Chat can be similarly optionally narrated with a custom translation key or format
    -   The entire message can have formatting applied, such as italics or a specific color (but currently not click or hover events)

### Commands

#### `place`

New command that replaces `placefeature` and can place features, jigsaws, structures, and templates at a given location. Syntax:

    place feature <feature> [pos]
    place jigsaw <pool> <start> <depth> [pos]
    place structure <structure> [pos]
    place template <template> [pos] [rotation] [mirror] [integrity] [seed]
    

Parameters:

-   `place feature` works like `placefeature` used to work
-   `place jigsaw` works like using the generate button in the UI of a Jigsaw Block
-   `place template` works like using the load button in the UI of a Structure Block
-   `place structure` generates a full structure, matching how structures generate during world generation
-   `feature`: The namespaced id of a configured feature to try to place
-   `structure`: The namespaced id of a structure to try to generate
-   `template`: The namespaced id of a template ("structure block file") to load and place
-   `pool`: The namespaced id of a template pool to start generating
-   `start`: The namespaced id name of a jigsaw to use as the starting anchor
-   `depth`: The maximum number of jigsaw connections to traverse during placement
-   `pos`: The position to use as the origin for the generation (if omitted, `~ ~ ~` is used)
-   `rotation`: The rotation to apply (if omitted, `none` is used)
-   `mirror`: The mirroring to apply (if omitted, `none` is used)
-   `integrity`: The structure integrity value between 0 and 1
-   `seed`: The seed to use for the randomized degradation when integrity is less than 1

### Debug

-   Added a heap memory allocation metric to the F3 debug screen
-   Added estimated GPU utilization percentage to performance profiling metrics and the F3 debug screen
    -   This is only available for graphics devices that support GPU timer queries
-   Removed the debug hotkey that cycles the render distance

### Game Events

#### Added Events

-   `teleport` with a vibration frequency of 5
-   `note_block_play` with a vibration frequency of 6
-   `instrument_play` with a vibration frequency of 15

#### Combined Events

The following events have been collapsed into `block_activate` and `block_deactivate`:

-   `block_press`
-   `block_unpress`
-   `block_switch`
-   `block_unswitch`

#### Other Changes

Other miscellaneous changes to game events:

-   `ring_bell` has been removed and replaced with `block_change`
-   Both `shulker_open` and `shulker_close` have been removed in favour of using `container_open` and `container_close`
-   `fishing_rod_cast` and `fishing_rod_reel_in` have been renamed to `item_interact_start` and `item_interact_finish`
-   `item_interact_start` is not detectable as a vibration to allow more specific actions be detected, like `drink` or `eat`, but `item_interact_finish` is
-   `entity_interact` should be dispatched more often when interacting with various mobs
-   Added the `dampens_vibrations` block tag that that includes all Wool and Wool Carpet blocks, to indicate blocks that will not trigger when placed, broken, or stepped on
-   Renamed item tag `occludes_vibration_signals` to `dampens_vibrations` item tag as well

#### Renamed Events

Some game events have been renamed, with some of those changes to make them more gramatically consistent:

-   `drinking_finish` -> `drink`
-   `entity_killed` -> `entity_die`
-   `entity_damaged` -> `entity_damage`
-   `elytra_free_fall` -> `elytra_glide`
-   `mob_interact` -> `entity_interact`
-   `ravager_roar` -> `entity_roar`
-   `wolf_shaking` -> `entity_shake`

### Game Rules

### Loot Tables

#### New functions

##### `set_instrument`

Sets the item tags needed for instrument items to a randomly selected instrument from a tag Parameters:

-   `options` - a tag reference specifying the instrument options to randomly pick from

### Multiplayer Secure Chat Signing

-   Chat messages between players are now cryptographically signed
    -   The message arguments to `/say`, `/msg`, `/teammsg`, and `/me` commands are all also signed
-   Players are given a Mojang provided key-pair on startup
-   Servers can require players to have a Mojang-signed public key by setting `enforce-secure-profile=true` in `server.properties`
    -   Enforcing secure profiles will prevent players without a Mojang-signed public key from connecting
    -   By default this is set to `false`, allowing players to connect without a Mojang-signed public key
-   Static chat styling can now be controlled by the server through the `chat_type` registry, or with server resource packs as before
-   Dynamic chat styling can also be controlled by the server, although this is only signed when Chat Preview is enabled
    -   Clients can prefer to always show the original, signed message by enabling "Only Show Secure Chat" in Chat Settings
-   Chat from players still using Mojang Accounts is not signed
    -   Their messages will not show for players with "Only Show Secure Chat" enabled
    -   They may be unable to join server with the `enforce-secure-profile` option enabled

### Pack filters

-   Data and resource packs can have `filter` section in `pack.mcmeta`
-   This section has mandatory field `block`, which is a list of patterns (regular expressions) for namespaces and paths
-   If any of the files in packs are added before one with `filter`, the section will match any pattern inside `block`, and it will then be filtered out (i.e. treated as if it wasn't present in the first place)
-   `filter` section does not apply to a pack containing it - only to packs loaded before it
-   Both `namespace` and `path` can be omitted
    -   Missing field matches every value
-   For example, adding a pack with this section in `pack.mcmeta` after the vanilla pack will hide all the recipes and advancements defined by the vanilla pack

#### Example

    "filter": {
        "block": [
            {
                "namespace": "minecraft",
                "path": "recipes/.*"
            },
            {
                "namespace": "minecraft",
                "path": "advancements/.*"
            }
        ]
    }
    

### Paintings

-   Paintings that are placeable in survival can now be controlled with the `painting_variant/placeable` tag
-   Added unused paintings from Bedrock edition (`earth`, `wind`, `fire`, `water`)
    -   These paintings are not placeable by default, but can be added through a datapack

### Point of Interest types

-   Removed `unemployed` and `nitwit` `point_of_interest_type`s
-   Added tag `point_of_interest_type/acquirable_job_site` for all job sites seeked by villagers with `none` profession
-   Added tag `point_of_interest_type/village` for PoI that are part of village
-   Added tag `point_of_interest_type/bee_home` for all PoI targeted by bees

### Predicates

-   The `feature` field in location predicates is now called `structure`

#### Entity predicate

-   `player`, `fishing_hook`, `lightning_bolt` and `catType` fields have been replaced with `type_specific`
-   `type_specific` has field `type` (one of `player`, `fishing_hook`, `lightning_bolt` or `cat`) and same fields as removed fields
-   `catType` has been wrapped to match new format and now uses new cat variant names instead of texture names:
-   New `type_specific` options:
    -   `frog` has `variant` field matching Frog variant (`minecraft:warm`, `minecraft:temperate` or `minecraft:cold`)
    -   `slime` applies for Slimes and Magma Cubes, has `size` field matching Slime size (smallest is `1`)

##### `catType` Example

Before:

     "catType": "minecraft:textures/entity/cat/british_shorthair.png"
    

After:

     "type_specific": {
        "type": "cat",
        "variant": "minecraft:british"
     }
    

##### `type_specific` Example

Before:

     "lightning_bolt": {
       "blocks_set_on_fire": 0
     }
    

After:

      "type_specific": {
        "type": "lightning",
        "blocks_set_on_fire": 0
      }
    

### Space glyph provider

-   The new glyph provider type `space` is added to allow creation of space-like glyphs
-   The new provider has a single argument called `advances` which is a map of codepoint to glyph advance (width)
-   The rendering of space glyph is no longer hardcoded (needs to be declared manually in font)

### World presets

-   New registry types `worldgen/world_preset` and `worldgen/flat_level_generator_preset` have been added to configure data-driven presets (like "Amplified" or "Single Biome")
-   Two tags for world presets have been added (`normal` and `alternative`) to control which values show on the "World Type" button in the "Create World" screen
-   One tag has been added (`visible`) for flat world presets to control the order that elements are displayed in the "Configure Flat World" screen
-   World presets can also be used as a value of `level-type` in `server.properties`

# Minecraft: Java Edition 1.18.2

We're now releasing 1.18.2 for Minecraft: Java Edition. This release adds universal tags and the placefeature command. It also introduces the possibility for experimental data packs to customize cave generation and to add new custom structures to worlds.

Additionally, this version contains compliance updates for South Korean players.

Enjoy!

## Changes in 1.18.2

-   Users running Minecraft in a 32-bit environment will receive a warning in the main menu about the upcoming end of 32-bit environment support
-   If you’re playing in South Korea, we added gameplay timers and notices in compliance with gaming laws to help remind players to take occasional breaks from gameplay
-   A seed of the number zero is no longer handled as a special case
-   Any spaces before/after an inputted seed will now be trimmed
-   Dolphins will now more accurately pick the closest structure regardless of type
-   Ender chests are no longer gift wrapped around Christmas

## Technical Changes in 1.18.2

-   Added command: `placefeature`
-   The `locate` command now uses a namespaced id parameter
-   The `locate` command parameter is now a configured structure rather than a structure type. For instance, you can now use `/locate village_desert` or `/locate shipwreck_beached`
-   `locate` and `locatebiome` commands now support tags (prefix with `#` to distinguish from normal ids)
-   It is now possible to add custom structures in experimental datapacks
-   A lot of the cave generation is now configurable through experimental datapacks
-   Any type present in registries (blocks, items, biomes, etc.) can now have tags
-   The datapack version is now 9

### `placefeature` Command

New command that places a configured feature at a given location. Syntax: `placefeature <id> [pos]` Parameters:

-   `id`: The namespaced id of a configured feature to place
-   `pos`: The position to use as the origin for the feature placement (if omitted, `~ ~ ~` is used)

### Configurable caves

-   A new registry was added for Density functions (caves are created by combining those together)
-   Noise settings got a new field `noise_router` (and lost a couple of flags), see `worldgen/noise_settings` folder in the worldgen report
-   Noise router wires data-driven parts of the cave generation with the rest of the code

### Configured Structures and Structure Sets

The game now generates and stores data-driven configured structures.

-   Experimental datapacks can add new structure sets
-   The `feature` field in location predicates now references a configured feature
-   The `exploration_map` loot table function `destination` field is now a configured feature tag id
-   The `exploration_map` loot table function no longer automatically sets the display name of the map

### Universal tags

-   Tags can now be defined for any registry (blocks, items, biomes, etc. - see `registries.json` in report)
-   New tags are stored in datapacks under `tags` directory (same as old ones)
    -   Names of new tag directories are the same as registry names (so `/data/[namespace]/tags/potion` and `/data/[namespace]/tags/worldgen/biome`)
    -   Existing tags (`blocks`, `items`, `fluids`, `entity_types`, `game_events` and `functions`) keep their name (for now)
-   Some fields in worldgen structures that previously accepted only lists of element ids now accept tags
    -   Those entries now accept `[id, ...]`, `id` (shortcut for `[id]`) and `#tag`
    -   Changed fields are:
        -   `feature.glow_lichen` configuration: `can_be_placed_on`
        -   `feature.spring_feature` configuration: `valid_blocks`
        -   `feature.simple_random_selector` configuration: `features`
        -   `block_predicate_type.matching_blocks`: `blocks`
        -   `block_predicate_type.matching_fluids`: `fluids`
        -   `biome`: inner list in `features`, map value in `carvers`
        -   `biome_source.checkerboard`: `biomes`
-   Some tag fields now require id to be prepended with `#` (however they are not yet accepting element list)
    -   `dimension_type`: `infiniburn`
    -   `feature.geode` configration: `blocks.cannot_replace`, `blocks.invalid_blocks`
    -   `feature.vegetation_patch`, `feature.waterlogged_vegetation_patch` configuration: `replaceable`
    -   `feature.root_system` configuration: `root_replaceable`
    -   `structure_processor.protected_blocks`: `value`

# Minecraft: Java Edition 1.18.1

We’re now releasing Minecraft: Java Edition 1.18.1. This release fixes a critical security issue for multiplayer servers, changes how the world fog works to make more of the world visible, and fixes a couple of other bugs.

If you are running a multiplayer server, we highly encourage you to upgrade to this version as soon as possible.

Enjoy!

## Technical Changes in 1.18.1

-   Fixed an issue that would cause players on low-bandwidth connections to get timeout errors when connecting to a server
-   World fog now starts further away from the player, to make distant terrain more visible
-   Instead of applying fog as a spherical volume it is now applied as a cylindrical volume

## Fixed Bugs in 1.18.1

# Minecraft: Java Edition 1.18

It’s been quite the trek, but we’re here. At the summit. The Caves & Cliffs Update: Part II is out today, completing the much anticipated cave update. What better way to celebrate than by climbing to the top of a higher than ever mountain. Let’s take a moment and just take in that view. Wait. What’s that sound. Don’t tell me that goat is back.

AAAAARGH.

Ouff! Ouch! Ow!

Where am I? It’s dark down here! It’s almost as if I fell a greater distance than I would have before today. Figures. While I try to get out of this dripstone cave, I hope you enjoy all of the new features that 1.18 brings. Could you pass me a candle before you leave? It really is dark down here.

## Features

-   Added an "Allow Server Listings" option to opt out of having your name displayed in server listings

-   New music has been added to the game
-   New ore distribution and large ore veins
-   Overworld build and generation limits have been expanded
-   Raised the cloud level from 128 to 192
-   Redesigned how effects look in the inventory screen, to allow them to show even with recipe book open
-   Removed world types "Caves" and "Floating islands" from the world creation screen
-   Sprinting is no longer reduced to walking when gently brushing your sleeve against a wall
-   Tropical Fish now also spawn in Lush Caves at any height
-   Villages are slightly more spread out
-   World spawn selection algorithm has been reworked, now spawns player according to climate parameters

### Advancements

-   Added "Caves & Cliffs" for falling from top to bottom of the Overworld
-   Added "Feels like home" for riding strider on lava for 50 blocks in the Overworld
-   Added "Star Trader" for trading with a villager at the build height limit
-   Added "Sound of Music" for playing music with a jukebox in a Meadow biome

### Blocks

-   Enchanting Tables now emit a low amount of light
-   Using Shears on the tip of a Cave Vine, Twisting Vine, Weeping Wine, and Kelp will stop them from further growing
-   Copper Ore now drops 2-5 (from 2-3) Raw Copper items
-   In the Stonecutter, a Block of Copper can be converted to 4 Cut Copper
-   Restricted Big Dripleaf placement to Clay, Grass, Dirt, Farmland, Moss, Rooted Dirt, Podzol, and Mycelium

### Effects

-   Your list of effects are now shown to the right of your inventory, instead of the left side
-   When the inventory effects list is visible, it will be hidden from the game view to reduce screen clutter
-   There's now two modes of seeing the effect list: Compact and Classic
    -   Classic is the pre-existing list of effects, one after another
    -   Compact is a single icon for each effect, suitable for small screen estate
-   The game will automatically switch between the two modes to suit the available screen estate (including having the recipe book open)

### Large ore veins

-   Ore Veins are large, rare, snake-like underground ore formations
-   Copper Ore Veins form between heights 0 and 50 and are mixed with Granite
-   Iron Ore Veins form betweens heights -60 and -8 and are mixed with Tuff

### Mob Spawning

-   Monsters now only spawn in places where the light from blocks is 0 (sky light still prevents spawning like before)

### Music

-   Added new music by Lena Raine and Kumi Tanioka to the Overworld (when playing in Survival Mode) and the main menu
-   Added a new music disc from Lena Raine titled 'Otherside'. This can be found rarely in Stronghold Corridor Chests or much more rarely in Dungeon Chests.

### New Overworld Biomes

#### Dripstone Caves

-   Contains plenty of Pointed Dripstone and Dripstone Block on the floors and ceilings, as well as within small pools of water
-   In some places, you'll find larger stalagmites, stalactites, and columns built from Dripstone Blocks
-   Contains extra Copper Ore
-   Drowned can spawn in aquifers inside Dripstone Caves

#### Frozen Peaks

-   Smooth mountain peaks with ice and snow
-   Spawns Goats and Yeti. Wait, no, actually it's just Goats.

#### Grove

-   Snowy terrain with big Spruce Trees and Powder Snow traps. You might want to wear leather boots!
-   Tends to generate on high-altitude terrain beneath mountain peaks or on hilltops
-   Spawns Wolves, Rabbits, and Foxes

#### Jagged Peaks

-   Dramatic jagged mountain peaks with Snow and Stone blocks
-   Spawns Goats

#### Lush Caves

-   Moss covers the floors and ceilings
-   Spore Blossoms grow from the ceiling and drip particles
-   Contains Clay pools with Dripleaf plants growing out of them
-   Contains Azalea Bushes and Flowering Azalea Bushes
-   The Azalea Tree loves to have its roots in Lush Caves, so if you find an Azalea Tree (either overground or in a cave) you know there is a Lush Cave beneath you
-   Cave Vines with Glow Berries grow from the ceiling and light up the caves

#### Meadow

-   Large grassy and flowery biome that tends to generate high up on plateaus or next to large mountain ranges
-   Sometimes contains a lone, tall Oak or Birch Tree with a Bee Nest
-   Think Sound of Music!
-   Spawns Donkeys, Rabbits, and Sheep

#### Snowy Slopes

-   Very snowy terrain that can hide Powder Snow traps. I hope you kept those leather boots!
-   Tends to generate on high-altitude terrain beneath mountain peaks or on hilltops
-   Spawns Rabbits and Goats

#### Stony Peaks

-   Stony mountain peaks that may be jagged or smooth
-   These sometimes have large strips of Calcite running through them

### New ore distribution

-   Changed ore generation to match the new world height, and to add more strategy to mining. There is no longer a single height level that is best for all ores – you need to make tradeoffs!
-   Iron Ore generates below height 72, with a strong bias towards height 16. Iron Ore also generates above 80, with more Iron Ore as you go higher.
-   Copper Ore generates between height 0 and 96, with a strong bias towards height 48. Copper Ore generates in larger amounts in Dripstone Caves Biome.
-   Lapis Lazuli Ore generates below height 64, with a strong bias towards height 0. However, Lapis Lazuli Ore below height -32 or above height 32 cannot generate exposed to air. It will either be buried or inside water.
-   Coal Ore generates above height 0, with a strong bias towards height 96 and above. Coal Ore has reduced air exposure, so you will find more Coal Ore buried or underwater than exposed to air.
-   Gold Ore generates below height 32, with a strong bias towards height -16. Extra Gold Ore generates below height -48. Extra Gold Ore can be found in Badlands biomes above height 32.
-   Redstone Ore generates below height 16. Redstone Ore generation gradually increases as you go below height -32 and further down.
-   Diamond Ore generates below height 16, with more Diamond Ore the lower you go. Diamond Ore have reduced air exposure, so you will find more Diamond Ore buried or underwater than exposed to air.
-   Emerald Ore generates above height -16 in mountainous biomes, with more Emerald Ore the higher you go. Emerald Ore below height 0 is very rare!

###### Ore Distribution in Minecraft 1.18

![Minecraft 1.18 Ore Distribution](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/images/1-18-ore-distribution.jpg)

### Noise caves and Aquifers

-   Noise caves are a new way of generating caves, providing more natural variety. They can get really huge sometimes! Noise caves come in three flavors:
    -   Cheese caves: Like the holes in swiss cheese. These often form caverns of various size.
    -   Spaghetti caves: Long squiggly tunnels, sometimes wide like tagliatelle
    -   Noodle caves: Thinner, squigglier, and more claustrophobic variant of spaghetti caves
-   No, they aren't loud. The "noise" part of noise caves is a technical term and has nothing to do with sound.
-   The old cave carvers and canyons still generate, combining with the noise caves to form interesting cave systems
-   As with carvers, noise caves form cave entrances where they intersect the surface
-   An aquifer is an area with local water level, independent of sea level
-   Aquifers are used during world generation to generate bodies of water inside noise caves
-   This sometimes results in large underground lakes
-   They can also form inside mountains and on the surface
-   Aquifers below y0 will sometimes be lava aquifers instead of water aquifers
-   Magma Blocks sometimes generates at the bottom of underground bodies of water
-   Underwater cave carvers and underwater canyons have been removed, since aquifers are used to generate water in caves instead

### Sprinting

-   Previously, any collision with a block would reduce sprinting to walking. Now, for very minor angles of collision with a block, players retain their sprint. For larger angles of collision, the old behavior is retained.

### Upgrading of old worlds

-   The transition between new and old terrain is less "cliffy"
    -   Will surface height blend? Yes.
    -   Will biomes blend? Yes.
    -   Will caves blend? Your mileage may vary.
-   In old chunks, if there is any Bedrock at y=0, the sections below non-air blocks will be filled with new generation
-   The old Bedrock between y=0 and y=4 in old chunks gets replaced with Deepslate
-   A new Bedrock layer is placed at y=-64

### World generation

-   Generation range and build limits have been expanded by 64 blocks up and 64 blocks down, to a total range of 384 blocks
-   Underground features, structures, and caves generate all the way down to y-64
-   Exception: Diorite, Granite, Andesite, and Dirt will not generate below y0
-   Tweaked size and positioning of Diorite, Andesite, and Granite generation
-   Dripstone clusters can no longer be found in normal caves, only in Dripstone Caves biomes
-   Starting from y8 and below, Deepslate gradually replaces all Stone
-   Deepslate blobs no longer generate above y0
-   The terrain shape and elevation varies dramatically, indepedently from biomes
    -   For example, forests and deserts could form up on a hill without needing a special biome just for that
-   Less Diorite, Granite, and Andesite generates above y 60
-   Strips of Gravel can generate in stony shores
-   Swamp trees can grow in water 2 blocks deep (instead of just 1 block deep)
-   Removed water lake features, aquifers provide local water levels
-   A bunch of biome variants with simular features but different shapes have been merged into one, since the shape is controlled independently now
-   Renamed some biomes
-   Geodes now only generate up to height 30

## Technical

-   Added an accessibility option to stop the sky from flashing during thunderstorms
-   Added `fall_from_height` and `ride_entity_distance` advancement triggers
-   Changed `nether_travel` to match other similar triggers
-   Added an option to specify the audio device used by the game
-   Replaced `light` and `barrier` particles with `block_marker`
-   Replaced the clientbound chunk update network packet with another one that additionally contains light update data
    -   The separate light update packet still exists and is sent when a light update happens without a chunk update
-   New video setting called "Chunk Builder"
-   Changed the prioritization order of the chunk rendering pipeline
    -   Unrendered chunk holes in the world should not appear anymore while flying fast with high render distance
-   View distance now causes chunks to load cylindrically around players instead of in a square
-   Added "Toggle Sprint" and "Toggle Sneak" to the Controls settings
-   Moved Keybinds out to their own settings screen, accessible from Controls
-   Information about the world generation noise is now displayed on the debug screen
-   Added `illageralt`, rune-like font from Minecraft Dungeons (currently only usable via commands)
-   Added startup option `--jfrProfile` and command `jfr` to start profiling with Java Flight Recorder as well as a few custom events
-   Loot table functions `set_contents` and `set_loot_table` now require a `type` field with a valid block entity type
-   Added new loot table function `set_potion`
-   The maximum amount of background threads are increased
-   Worlds last saved before Minecraft 1.2 (pre "Anvil") can no longer be opened directly
-   Data pack format has been increased to 8
-   Resource pack format has been increased to 8
-   `--report` option in data generator now creates reference files for the entirety of the worldgen, instead of just the biomes
-   Removed length limits for scoreboard, score holder, and team names
-   Standalone `server.jar` now bundles contains individual libraries instead of being flat archive
-   Size limit for server resource packs has been increased to 250 MB
-   Servers can now set property `hide-online-players` to `true` in order to not send a player list on status requests
-   New setting called "Simulation Distance"
-   Mob spawners can now override light checks for spawning
-   Added telemetry for world loading

### Advancements

#### Changed triggers

##### `nether_travel`

-   `entered` condition is renamed to `start_position`
-   `exited` has been removed since it was identical to `player.location`

#### New triggers

##### `fall_from_height`

-   Triggered when a player lands after falling
-   Conditions:
    -   `player` - a player for which this trigger runs
    -   `start_position` - a location predicate for the last position before the falling started
    -   `distance` - a predicate for the distance between `start_position` and the player

##### `ride_entity_in_lava`

-   Triggered for every tick when a player rides in lava
-   Conditions
    -   `player` - a player for which this trigger runs
    -   `start_position` - a position where the riding started (first tick on lava)
    -   `distance` - a predicate for the distance between `start_position` and the player

### Chunk Builder Setting

-   This setting determines if chunk sections are updated immediately during a single frame, or asynchronously using threads
-   "Fully Blocking" corresponds to the previous way chunks were updated, which prevents potential visual gaps when blocks are destroyed
-   "Threaded" will significantly reduce stutters when blocks are placed or destroyed (especially with light sources), however brief visual gaps may rarely occur
-   "Semi Blocking" is the middle-option, and will only immediately update chunks that are deemed important, otherwise updates occur asynchronously using threads

### Java 17

Minecraft now uses Java version 17. If you are using a default setup, the Launcher will download and install the correct version. If you are using a custom Java setup, or a third-party launcher, you will need to ensure that your Java installation is version 17 or above.

### JFR Profiling

#### Custom events

All events are enabled when starting the profiling using either `jfr start` command or `--jfrProfile` startup flag. If profiling is started through any other means for monitoring purposes, only the `ServerTickTime`, `LoadWorld` and `NetworkSummary` are included by default.

-   `minecraft.ServerTickTime`: periodic event (1 second intervals) exposing average server tick times
-   `minecraft.NetworkSummary`: periodic event (10 second intervals) reporting total packet sizes and counts per connection
-   `minecraft.PacketReceived | minecraft.PacketSent`: network traffic
-   `minecraft.ChunkGeneration`: time taken to generate individual chunk stages
-   `minecraft.LoadWorld`: initial world loading duration

#### Overview

[Java Flight Recorder](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/328) is the internal JVM profiling tool bundled with the Java Runtime to analyze performance and runtime characteristics.  
It's a useful tool for exposing internal JVM performance metrics as well as custom metrics that can be monitored or analyzed using any stock Java profiler or monitoring agents.

#### Profiling lifecycle

A profiling run can be started using any of the following alternatives:  
The run will then be stopped either by:

-   `--jfrProfile` startup flag when starting a Minecraft server or client
-   `jfr start` in-game command
-   Regular Java CLI tools such as `jcmd`
-   shutting down the JVM
-   `jfr stop` in-game command
-   `jcmd` CLI tool

#### Reports

A summary JSON report is written both to the log file and in the debug folder accompanied by a `.jfr` recording ready to be analyzed in i.e [JMC](https://github.com/openjdk/jmc) or any other profiler tool supporting the format.

### Loot tables

#### Changed functions

##### `set_contents`, `set_loot_table`

Added new mandatory field `type`. This type will be written into `BlockEntityTag.id`, to make sure that this tag can be correctly migrated between versions.

#### New functions

##### `set_potion`

-   Sets the `Potion` tag on any item

###### Parameters:

-   `id` - potion id

### Maximum amount of background threads increased

-   Various background tasks including worldgen are executed on a background thread pool
-   The default thread pool size equals the amount of available CPU threads, minus one
-   The upper thread pool limit has been raised from 7 to 255, which should help higher-end machines with improved world-gen performance
-   The upper limit can be overridden via the `max.bg.threads` Java system property, for example when running multiple servers on a single machine

### Mob spawning

-   Monster spawning limits are now per-player, rather than global for each dimension

### Old world conversion

-   Worlds last saved before Minecraft 1.2 (pre "Anvil") now require conversion in a previous version of the game to be able to be opened
-   We recommend that you upgrade your old version, 1.2 (pre "Anvil") or older, to version 1.6.4 - worlds opened for the first time in later versions will have incorrect biome information

### Particles

#### `block_marker`

-   Renders with a texture declared in the `particle` slot for a model assigned to the configured block state
-   Is summoned with same syntax as the `block` particle (i.e. `block_marker wheat[age=2]`)

### Resource Pack format

-   `minecraft/textures/gui/container/inventory.png` now contains an extra sprite for a thin-layout version of the effect list in the inventory

### Server bundling

-   `server.jar` now bundles individual libraries instead of merging all the files into a single archive
-   This change is meant to solve certain problems related to Java modules
-   On startup, `server.jar` will unpack libraries into a directory configured by `bundlerRepoDir` (default: working directory)
-   To run a different main class other than the server, use the `bundlerMainClass` property (for example `java -DbundlerMainClass=net.minecraft.data.Main -jar server.jar --reports`) or unpack the jar manually and use the contents of `META-INF/classpath-joined` for command line
-   If `bundlerMainClass` is empty, the program will just validate and extract files, and will then exit
-   Server classes are now signed

### Simulation Distance Setting

-   A new slider which is available under video settings
-   Entities, blocks, and fluids will not be updated outside of simulation distance
-   Allows higher render distance with less CPU load
-   There's also a new `simulation-distance` property in the dedicated server properties

### Spawner data changes

Example:

    SpawnData: {
        entity: {
            id: "minecraft:cow"
        },
        custom_spawn_rules: {
              sky_light_limit: {min_inclusive: 10, max_inclusive: 15}
        },
    }
    SpawnPotentials: [
      {
        data: {
          custom_spawn_rules: {
              block_light_limit: {min_inclusive: 0, max_inclusive: 15}
          },
          entity: {id: "minecraft:pig"},
        },
        weight: 2
      },
      {
        data: {
          custom_spawn_rules: {
              block_light_limit: {min_inclusive: 5, max_inclusive: 10},
              sky_light_limit: {min_inclusive: 10, max_inclusive: 15}
          },
          entity: {id: "minecraft:panda"}
        },
        weight: 1
      }
    ]
    

-   Spawners now support the `custom_spawn_rules` NBT in the `SpawnData` field and the `SpawnPotentials` list
-   `custom_spawn_rules` currently may contain fields `block_light_limit` and `sky_light_limit` - both are integer ranges with fields `min_inclusive` and `max_inclusive`
-   To make `SpawnPotentials` format similar to other weighted lists, structure was changed to `{weight: <int>, data: <previous contents without 'Weight', 'Entity' renamed to 'entity'>}`
-   To accommodate that change, previous contents of `SpawnData` were moved to `SpawnData.entity` (making format of that field same as elements of `SpawnPotentials.data`)

### Telemetry

In this release, we are re-introducing diagnostic tracking, which was part of Minecraft: Java Edition until 2018. We are bringing it back to better understand our players and to improve their experience. Specifically this information will help us prioritise various aspects of development and identify pain points. All data is treated according to GDPR and CCPA best practices and is used to develop a better-performing and generally more enjoyable Minecraft: Java Edition.

-   At this point, the only implemented event is world load

#### World Load event

-   Sent when loading singleplayer world or connecting to multiplayer server
-   Contains following information:
    -   launcher identifier
    -   user identitifer (XUID)
    -   client session id (changes on restart)
    -   world session id (changes per world load, to be reused for later events)
    -   game version
    -   operating system name and version
    -   Java runtime version
    -   if client or server is modded (same information as on crash logs)
    -   server type (single player, Realms or other)
    -   game mode

### World Data: Chunk Format

-   Removed chunk's `Level` and moved everything it contained up
-   Chunk's `Level.Entities` has moved to `entities`
-   Chunk's `Level.TileEntities` has moved to `block_entities`
-   Chunk's `Level.TileTicks` and `Level.ToBeTicked` have moved to `block_ticks`
-   Chunk's `Level.LiquidTicks` and `Level.LiquidsToBeTicked` have moved to `fluid_ticks`
-   Chunk's `Level.Sections` has moved to `sections`
-   Chunk's `Level.Structures` has moved to `structures`
-   Chunk's `Level.Structures.Starts` has moved to `structures.starts`
-   Chunk's `Level.Sections[].BlockStates` and `Level.Sections[].Palette` have moved to a container structure in `sections[].block_states`
-   Chunk's `Level.Biomes` are now paletted and live in a similar container structure in `sections[].biomes`
-   Chunk's `Level.CarvingMasks[]` is now `long[]` instead of `byte[]`
-   Added `yPos` the minimum section y position in the chunk
-   Added `below_zero_retrogen` containing data to support below zero generation
-   Added `blending_data` containing data to support blending new world generation with existing chunks

### World Generation

-   Bedrock layers now generate dependent on the world seed
-   New random number generator for overworld generation

## Fixed Bugs in 1.18

# Minecraft: Java Edition 1.17.1

We're now releasing Minecraft: Java Edition 1.17.1. This release changes some behaviours of the features added in Caves & Cliffs: Part I, and it also fixes a few bugs and critical issues.

## Changes in 1.17.1

-   Blue axolotls can now only be obtained through breeding
-   Non-screaming goats now have a rare chance to produce a screaming goat when bred

# Minecraft: Java Edition 1.17

It’s here. The Cave Update, with a side of cliffs. That’s right, The Caves & Cliffs Update: Part I is launching today!

Now you can finally swim with the glow squid, fight alongside the axolotls, and get rammed off a mountain by a goat. You can also build with new blocks like copper, pointed dripstone, and moss, hang some hanging roots and cave vines, and marvel at the new ore textures. Light up your homes, caves, mineshaft and lives with the glow berry. Build a spyglass and peep your next adventure or just keep track of what that creeper over yonder is doing. Wait, what is it doing? Is it getting closer, or is this spyglass just really good?

Have fun with Part I!

-   If the stalactite tip is inside water it won't drip, and therefore won't trigger any growth
-   If the stalagmite tip is inside water it won't receive drops, and therefore won't be grown by a dripping stalactite. Same thing if there is any fluid between the two tips

-   The Resource pack version is now 7
-   Upgraded to Java 16
-   Values inside random number generators can now be nested

### `/debug function`

-   New debug subcommand executes a command with the same syntax as function
-   Every executed command, message (even if it would be normally invisible), result, or error is stored to file

### Advancements

#### Changed predicates

##### Block predicate

-   `block` field expended to `blocks`, which now accepts an array of block types

##### Entity predicate

-   `passenger` - a new sub-predicate for a passenger that is directly riding this vehicle (if present, must match one or more)
-   `stepping_on` - a location predicate for a block that an entity is currently standing on
-   `lightning_bolt` - a sub-predicate that is valid only for a lightning bolt entity

##### Item predicate

-   `item` field expended to `items`, which now accepts an array of item types

##### Player predicate

-   `looking_at` - an entity that is currently viewed by a player
    -   uses same the line-of-sight rules as attacking mobs
    -   actual detection radius might be changed in future

#### Changed triggers

##### `effects_changed`

-   Added `source` triggers that match an entity that triggered the change
-   Might be empty when:
    -   there is no entity (for example, effect gained from a Beacon)
    -   the effect is self-applied
    -   an effect is removed

#### Lightning Bolt

-   `blocks_set_on_fire` - a range check for blocks set on fire by this entity
-   `entity_struck` - a predicate for entities struck by this lightning bolt (if present, must match one or more)

#### New triggers

##### `lightning_strike`

-   Triggers for any player within a certain radius of a lightning strike
-   Conditions
    -   `player` - a player for which this trigger runs
    -   `lightning` -a predicate for a lightning entity
    -   `bystander` - a predicate for one of the entities in a certain area around a strike that is not hurt by it

-   Triggered for every tick of using items (like Crossbows and Spyglasses)
-   Conditions
    -   `player` - a player that uses an item
    -   `item` - an item being used

### Chat component separators

-   Added `occludes_vibration_signals` block tag. Anything in this tag will occlude vibrations, and inherits `wool` tag entries by default
-   Components that prints lists of names, like `selector` or `nbt` can now override separator (`,` by default) with `separator` element
-   Examples:
    -   `{"selector": "@e[type=chicken]", "separator": "|"}`
    -   `{"nbt": "CustomName", "entity": "@e[type=chicken]", "interpret": true, "separator": {"text": "*", "color": "red"}}`

### Commands

#### `item`

Modifies the item or block inventory. This command has three forms: Possible sources and targets: For example, `/item replace block ~ ~ ~ container.0 from entity @s enderchest.0` will copy the first item from the player's Ender Chest to the first slot of a container that the player is currently standing on.

-   `/item replace <target> with <item stack> [<count>]` - the same as old `replaceitem`
-   `/item replace <target> from <source> [<modifier>]` - copies an item for source to target(s), optionally applying a modifier
-   `/item modify <target> <modifier>` - modifies an item (without copying)
-   `entity <selector> <slot>`
-   `block <x> <y> <z> <slot>`

### Custom server resource packs

-   A dedicated server can enforce custom resource packs by setting `require-resource-pack` in `server.properties`
    -   When this option is used, players will be prompted for a response and will be disconnected if they decline the required pack
    -   If user has a setting to automatically decline packs, the prompt will still be shown (since the alternative would be automatic disconnection)
-   A dedicated server can also configure an additional message to be shown on the resource pack prompt (`resource-pack-prompt` in `server.properties`, expects chat component syntax, can contain multiple lines)
    -   This message won't be shown if user has already declined pack and it's not required

### Customized worlds

-   World height related values are now exposed for customized worlds

### Data Packs

Changes to data packs for version 7:

-   Removal of `/replaceitem` (replaced with `/item replace`)

### Entity storage

-   Entities have been extracted from main (terrain) chunks and are now stored in a separate `entities` directory (similar to POI storage)
-   Those new files are still region files with NBT

### Item modifiers

-   The function part of loot tables can now be defined as a separate data pack resource in the `item_modifiers` directory
-   This type of file can contain a single function (i.e single JSON object) or an array of functions

### Java 16

Minecraft now uses a more recent version of Java. If you are using a default setup, the Launcher will download and install the correct version. If you are using a custom Java setup, or a third-party launcher, you will need to ensure that your Java installation is version 16 or above.

### Light block

-   Op-only (`/give`), air-like, waterloggable block
-   Emits light at a level that is determined by block state
-   Visible and targetable only when an item is held (similar to Barrier Blocks)
-   Right click cycles the light level

### Loot tables

#### Changed conditions

#### Changed functions

##### `copy_nbt`

-   `source` parameter can now accept an object with type and additional parameters
-   The old syntax of just writing "target" is present and equivalent to `{"type": "context", "target": "<target>"}`
-   New `storage` provider (example: `{"type": "storage", <namespaced id>}`) can be used to access command storage

##### `set_count`

This function now has `add` parameter. If `true`, the change will be relative to the current item count. If `false`, item count will be replaced with current value (default behavior)

##### `set_damage`

This function now has an `add` parameter. If `true`, the change will be relative to the current damage. If `false`, the damage will be replaced with the current value (default behavior)

#### New conditions

##### `value_check`

Checks range of value. Parameters:

-   `value` - see "New value providers" section (currently a combination of random generators and score)
-   `range` - min/max range

#### New functions

##### `set_banner_pattern`

Sets tags needed for banner patterns. Parameters:

-   `patterns` - list of pattern objects:
    -   `pattern` - the name of the pattern (`square_bottom_left`, `bricks`, etc.)
    -   `color` - the name of the color (`light_gray`, etc.)
-   `append` - if `true`, the new elements will be appended to the existing ones instead of replacing them

##### `set_enchantments`

Modifies enchantments on an item.

###### Parameters

-   `enchantments` - map of enchantment id to level value (can be a score or a random number)
-   `add` - if `true`, the change will be relative to the current level. If `false`, the level will be replaced with the current value (default behavior)

#### New value providers

Note: value providers can be used in same places as random number generators.

##### `score`

Returns scaled scoreboard value.

###### Parameters

-   `score` - scoreboard name
-   `target` - see below
-   `scale` - scaling factor (float)

###### Scoreboard provider targets

-   `<target>` or `{"type": "context", "target": <target>}` where `<target>` can be one of `this`, `killer`, `direct_killer`, `killer_player` (not all may be available depending on context)
-   `{"type": "fixed", "name": "<scoreboard name>"}` for fixed scoreboard name (may be fake player)

### Markers

Markers are a new type of entity that is meant for custom use cases like map-making and data packs.

-   Only exist on the server-side, and are never sent to clients
-   They do not do any updates of their own
-   They have a `data` compound field that can contain any data

### OpenGL

Rendering is now using OpenGL 3.2 core profile. All fixed-function rendering has been replaced with shader-based rendering.

#### Shaders

Shaders are now included for all supported render states. Any shader, except for the `blit` shader, can also be replaced in resource packs. For now, replacing these shaders is **not officially supported**, and the way it works may change in the future. The current rendering engine uses a system similar to the post-processing shader pipeline. There are some differences between both systems that cater to the slightly different requirements.

### Particles

-   Added new particle types called `vibration` and `dust_color_transition`

### Performance metrics reporting

These will be saved to a zip file in `debug/profiling/<yyyy-MM-dd_HH.mm.ss-[levelname]-[version]>.zip` and could be used for performance regression analysis if included in bug reports. The exact metrics, output format, and names are susceptible to change between versions. Our plan is to continue iterating on which metrics to capture.

#### Client F3+L shortcut

Pressing F3+L while in the game will start a recording for 10 seconds, which captures metrics such as tick durations, used heap sizes, and other more detailed stats. Pressing F3+L before the 10-second limit will end the recording early. This shortcut is always available to clients, even on multi-player servers where it will record client-side performance.

#### Dedicated Server perf start/stop command

-   `perf start` will start a recording for 10 seconds, which captures metrics such as tick durations, used heap sizes, and other more detailed stats.
-   `perf stop` before the 10-second limit will end the recording early.

### Resource Packs

Changes to resource packs for version 7:

-   Drowned texture mirroring has changed (see [MC-174685](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-174685))
-   The slots for the Game Mode Selector are now 26 pixels instead of 25

### Server properties

-   Removed `max-build-height`

### Statistics

-   The statistic for play time has been renamed to `play_time`
-   There is now a statistic for "Time with World Open" (`total_world_time`) that also includes time when the game was paused

# Minecraft: Java Edition 1.16.5

Happy Friday! We're now releasing 1.16.5, which fixes two critical stability issues. We are not releasing more information about these issues at this time to protect servers that have not yet updated.

This release is network compatible with 1.16.4 - this means you do not need to upgrade your game right away to play on an upgraded server. However, we highly encourage all server owners to update as soon as possible to apply the stability fixes.

Next week, we aim to release the next snapshot of Caves & Cliffs. Stay tuned!

# Minecraft: Java Edition 1.16

One does not simply walk into the Nether, but it seems that's what everyone is about to do anyway...

Today we're releasing the full Nether Update in all its glory! Traverse through familiar, fiery wastes into new unexplored fungal forests, spooky valleys, and deltas brimming with basalt. Dig your way through these biomes and you might be able to find a new curious material, suspiciously titled "ancient debris". What will you make of it (it’s totally not Netherite)?

Fight your way through hordes of Piglins… Or don't! They’re actually pretty cool if you bring some bling. And in case you find yourself in the wrong end of a bargain, make sure that you have access to a functional respawn anchor. I advise you to not use your regular bed unless you’re feeling a bit… “adventurous”.

Enjoy the update!

-   Farmers can now put excess seeds in the composter to create bone meal
    -   Bone meal is used by the farmers to grow crops
-   Farmers share excess wheat to other farmers, so more farmers can make bread

### Game Mode Switcher

New F3 debug feature which allows you to switch game modes with traditional "tabbing" functionality.

-   Hold F3 and tap F4 to open the menu
-   Tapping F4 will cycle the game mode, or you can use the mouse
-   Release F3 to apply
-   Your last game mode is remembered and will be the first selected option, so you can quickly toggle between two game modes with a single press of F3 + F4!

### Hoe Changes

We've made some changes to hoes to make them more useful in the Nether.

-   Each tier has different speed at which hoes mine blocks they are effective against
-   Hoes can now be enchanted with the following enchantments: Efficiency, Fortune, Silk Touch
-   Those enchantments can now be provided through enchanting table
-   Hoes are now the appropriate tool for mining hay, targets, dried kelp blocks, leaves, Shroomlights, Nether wart blocks, warped wart blocks, sponges, and wet sponges.

### Hoglins

-   Hoglins are big aggressive beasts that live in crimson forests in the Nether
-   They attack players on sight. Be careful – they can easily knock you off a ledge!
-   Hoglins drop pork and sometimes leather, but not willingly
-   You can breed Hoglins by feeding them crimson fungi. Do so at your own risk
-   Hoglins get hunted by Piglins sometimes, but they don't go down without a fight
-   Despite this, Hoglins and Piglins aren't enemies – more like an ecosystem
-   Baby Hoglins like to pretend they are tough – but don't worry, they're more bark than bite
-   Want to keep hoglins off your back? Pro tip: Hoglins hate the smell of warped fungi
-   Hoglins that somehow end up in the Overworld become Zoglins fairly quickly – but who would ever bring a Hoglin to the Overworld?

### Lodestone

A new block that can help you get your bearings!

-   Crafted from a Netherite ingot and chiseled stone bricks
-   Use a compass on a lodestone to create a lodestone compass, which will point to that lodestone

### Mobs

-   Players can no longer mount another entity when the crouch key is held down
-   Added gamerule universalAnger (disabled by default), which makes angered neutral mobs attack any nearby player – not just the player that angered them. Works best if you disable forgiveDeadPlayers
-   Added gamerule forgiveDeadPlayers (enabled by default), which makes angered neutral mobs stop being angry when the targeted player dies nearby

#### Forgive dead players

-   If this gamerule is disabled, then angered mobs will stay angry even if the targeted player dies
-   If both forgiveDeadPlayers and universalAnger are enabled, an angered neutral mob will stop being angry when their target dies. They won't seek any new targets after that
    -   Notable exception: Angered Zombified Piglins continuously spread anger. So even if one Zombified Piglin stops being angry because its target died, other angered Zombified Piglins nearby are likely to make it angry again. The only way to stop the anger is if none of the angered Zombified Piglins see a player for a while

#### Neutral mob anger

Updated anger management for most neutral mobs (polar bear, wolf, bee, Enderman, Piglin, Zombified Piglin).

-   When hurt by a player, the neutral mob will target that player and try to kill it
-   The mob will stay angry until the player is dead or out of sight for a while
-   Anger is persistent, so a player can't escape by temporarily logging out or switching dimension
-   If a targeted player dies near the angered mob, it will stop being angry (unless forgiveDeadPlayers is disabled)
-   Neutral mobs also get angry at other mobs who hurt them. However, that anger is not persistent
-   Angered neutral mobs will only attack the offending player, not innocent bystanders
    -   Notable exception: If a beehive or nest is broken, the bees will be angry at all nearby players
-   Some mobs spread anger (wolf, Zombified Piglin, Piglin, bee). If a player attacks one, all nearby mobs of the same type will get angry at that player

#### Universal anger

Universal anger is basically guilt by association. A neutral mob attacked by players will be angry at players in general, regardless of who attacked them. More specifically:

-   A neutral mob attacked by a player will target the nearest player, even if that player wasn't the attacker
-   Every time the neutral mob is hit by a player it will update its attack target to the nearest player
-   Players can use this to make neutral mobs attack other players. Who would ever do something that devious?
-   Universal anger does not apply when a neutral mob is attacked by another mob - only when it is attacked by a player
-   Universal anger is persistent. The angered mob will stay angry even if the player logs out and logs in, or jumps through a portal and back
-   Mobs that spread anger will also spread universal anger. So if a player attacks a Zombified Piglin, all other Zombified Piglins within sight will be universally angry and attack their nearest player
-   An angered neutral mob will stop being angry if it can't see any eligible target for a while

#### Zombified Piglins

-   Zombie Pigmen are now known as Zombified Piglins, and they now have ears. Well, at least one ear
-   Zombified Piglins no longer attack innocent bystanders (unless you enable gamerule universalAnger)
-   Zombified Piglins stop being angry if the targeted player dies nearby (unless you disable gamerule forgiveDeadPlayers)
-   Zombified Piglins continuously spread to other Zombified Piglins, as long as they see their target

### Nether Biome Fog

-   Biome fog color smoothly blends between biomes. Smooth!

### Netherite

-   A new high level material found in the Nether. Use it to upgrade your diamond gear!

#### How to make Netherite

1.  Mine ancient debris in the lower depths of the Nether. At your own risk though. No insurance coverage for that
2.  Refine it into Netherite scrap in a furnace or blast furnace
3.  Combine four Netherite scrap with four gold ingots in a crafting table to make a Netherite ingot
4.  Use a smithing table to fuse the Netherite ingot with your diamond weapon, tool, or armor

#### Netherite effects

-   Netherite items float in lava – just so you don't lose all your gear after that unplanned lava bath
-   Netherite items have higher enchantment value than diamond (but not as high as gold)
-   Netherite tools work faster and last longer than diamond
-   Netherite weapons do more damage than diamond
-   Netherite armor have higher toughness and durability than diamond
-   Netherite armor gives you knockback resistance, so you barely get knocked back at all when hit by arrows and such
-   Netherite blocks can be used as the base of a beacon and Netherite ingots can be used as the fuel for a beacon. Weird flex but ok
-   ...and it looks cool!

### Parity

-   Changed ambient block lighting in the Nether for parity with Bedrock edition

### Parrot

-   Parrots imitate hostile mobs less often
-   Parrots do not randomly imitate hostile mobs when gamemode is on peaceful

### Piglins

-   Piglins are an aggressive civilization that live in the Nether
-   They mostly hang around in Crimson Forests, but you might find some in the Nether Wastes too
-   They think of players as target practice and will attack on sight
-   However, if you dress appropriately, they will see you as a respectable figure. Or tolerable at least
-   Piglins are suspicious of strangers. If they see you opening a chest or other container, they will assume that you're stealing and will treat you accordingly
-   If Piglins hear you break a chest or a block of gold (or similar), they will also assume you are stealing
-   Piglins LOVE gold and get very distracted by gold items
-   Gold ingots are currency to Piglins. Throw ingots at them, or right-click them with an ingot, to barter for various goods
-   Piglins sometimes get hungry and hunt Hoglins for food. Or they try at least. They results... vary.
-   Piglins prefer to hunt and fight in groups. When a fight is happening, everyone wants in
-   Piglins that somehow end up in the Overworld become zombified fairly quickly
-   Piglins are creeped out by soul fire and Zombified Piglins, and will avoid them if possible
-   Wither skeletons and Withers are a historic enemies of the Piglins and will be attacked on sight
-   Baby Piglins are not as dangerous, but they can be mischievous, so watch your back
    -   ...and they like to play with Baby Hoglins
-   Added a Piglin banner pattern that can be found in bastion remnants

### Redstonewire

The blockstate, rendering, and behavior of redstone wire are more in line with each other. Redstone will provide power to blocks on all sides it shows a visual connection to, and not do so on those sides without a visual connection.

-   A dot of redstone will not power its surrounding blocks
-   A single redstone wire is now represented as a cross
-   A wire on top of a block, which is redirected from below, will now power the sides it is redirected to. E.g. a fence gate above the redirecting wire will be powered
-   Wires that redirect upwards to wires on non-conductive blocks used to only be redirected visually. Now, this redirection applies to their behavior as well
-   A wire that is redirected to go over a block will now always provide power to the block. This is most noticeable when the wire has signal strength 1
-   When right-clicking a single piece of redstone, it will toggle between a the cross and the dot

#### Target block

-   The target block now conducts redstone signals

### Ruined Portals

Shattered remains of ancient Nether portals. Wonder who built them?

-   They can be found in any Overworld or Nether biome
-   Some are hidden underground, under the sea, or buried in sand

### Soul Speed

Never suffer again drudging through Soul Sand Valleys – Soul Speed has you covered!

-   Shine your boots of choice with this soul-sucking enchantment to speed around on soul sand and soul soil
-   However, there's a downside: enchantments will slowly degrade your boots each soul block you walk on
-   Can only be obtained by bartering with those pesky Piglins

### Soulsand Valley

Soulsand Valleys can now be found in the Nether!

-   An open space made mostly of soul sand and soul soil
-   Basalt pillars span from floor to ceiling
-   Fossile remains of unknown creatures from the past litter the valley
-   Ash falls through the air
-   A light blue glow envelopes the valley
-   Beware of skeletons here

### Sounds

-   Ghasts sounds are now heard at shorter range
-   Updated block sounds for bone blocks, Netherrack, soul sand, Nether wart, Nether bricks, and quartz ore
-   New ambient sounds for the Nether biomes
-   New mood detection algorithm for cave sounds
-   Added a new music disc titled "Pigstep" by Lena Raine, which can only be found in bastion remnants

### Strider

A new mob living the lava lakes of the Nether.

-   Strides on top of the surface of lava
-   Can be saddled, but has a will of its own
-   Really likes the smell of warped fungi – might even be convinced to follow it

### Target Block

Because let's face it, your aim could use some practice!

-   The closer you hit to the center, the larger the redstone signal
-   Test your skills with a variety of projectiles, including eggs, snowballs, tridents, and more
-   You will need one hay block and four redstone for this recipe

### Villager Workstation Logic

-   Villagers no longer try to work at the same workstation
-   The most experienced nearby villager for the profession corresponding to the workstation you add will get the workstation
-   Villagers now have to walk to and reach the workstation before they can acquire the profession and/or work there
-   Villagers can no longer claim workstations or professions during raids or night time
-   Villagers will check and make sure their workstation is valid at all times of day as long as they are within 16 blocks of their workstation

### Warped Forest

Warped Forests can now be found in the Nether!

-   Warped nylium carpets the cave floor with all kinds of strange new vegetation
-   Warped nylium can be bonemealed to get more of the strange new vegetation
-   Huge warped fungi make up the "trees" of this forest, with Shroomlights lighting up the forest floor
-   Warped wart blocks can be cleared quickly using a hoe
-   A dark blue fog covers the forest
-   Warped spores swirl through the air
-   The Warped Forests are strange, but also the least hostile place in the Nether

### Weeping Vines

-   Weeping vines are now climbable!

### World Generation

-   The old Nether biome is now called Nether Wastes
-   Shipwrecks and ocean ruins are now a bit less common, so you get more excited when you find one!
-   Patches of blackstone and gravel now generate in all Nether biomes, and patches of soul sand now generate in Soul Sand Valleys

### Zoglins

-   Zoglins are zombified Hoglins – the result of bringing a Hoglin into the Overworld
-   Unlike Hoglins, they can't be bred or fed, and they don't care about warped fungus
-   Beware – these beasts are raving mad and attack just about everything they see!

## Technical

-   Added `target_hit` advancement trigger
-   Added `thrown_item_picked_up_by_entity` advancement trigger
-   Added `player_generates_container_loot` advancement trigger

-   Removed `safely_harvest_honey` advancement trigger
-   Added `player` check to every trigger (except `impossible`)
-   Entity checks in triggers can now use loot table condition syntax
-   Attributes are now added to game registry, similar to items, sound events, etc.
-   Chat component style can now select font.
-   Block storage format in chunks slightly changed to speed up various tasks (rendering, pathfinding, world generation, etc).
-   Added a `locatebiome` command
-   Tab completion for resource location will match any part after an `_`
-   The compass now has `LodestonePos`, `LodestoneDimension` and `LodestoneTracked` data fields. If `LodestoneTracked` is zero, the game will skip checking for a Lodestone in the specified position
-   Slightly changed datapack loading to prevent custom datapacks from crashing
-   Data packs can now be selected on world creation
-   Added a `enable-status` option to the server.properties file which if set to `false` will suppress replies to status requests from clients. This makes the server appear offline in the multiplayer screen
-   Full range of Unicode characters is now supported (some may know what that means 😉)
-   Mobs avoid walking on magma blocks and lit campfires
-   Cached repeated block type lookups and collisions during pathfinding for increased performance
-   Minor optimizations in collision detection
-   Top level element in predicate file can now be array (all contents will be ANDed)
-   Smithing recipes can now be added or changed through data packs
-   Added control over how much entity data a server sends to clients
-   Added a JMX MBean to monitor dedicated server tick times
-   Shulkers with "NoAI" can now be summoned with rotation
-   Added `strider_one_cm` custom statistics for riding Striders
-   Expanded the max size per axis of structure blocks from 32 to 48

-   Difficulty and game rules can now be changed from "Create World" screen
-   "Singleplayer" button will jump directly to "Create World" screen if there are no worlds to select
-   Temporarily removed structure settings from flat level preset strings (workaround: use import/export settings functionality)

### Advancements

#### Extended entity checks

Entity checks in triggers can now use loot table condition syntax. Old notation:

    {
      "trigger": "minecraft:player_killed_entity",
      "conditions": {
        "entity": {
          "type": "minecraft:blaze"
        }
      }
    }
    

is now equivalent to:

    {
      "trigger": "minecraft:player_killed_entity",
      "conditions": {
        "entity": [
          {
            "condition": "minecraft:entity_properties",
            "predicate": {
              "type": "minecraft:blaze"
            },
            "entity": "this"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    

**Note 1**: Like in loot tables, all conditions in top level array must be met for whole condition to trigger. **Note 2**: To access new functionality, top level element must be JSON array. JSON object are interpreted as old notation.  
Full list of extended triggers:

-   New field `player` in every trigger
-   `bred_animals` - `parent`, `partner`, `child`
-   `channeled_lightning` - `victims`
-   `cured_zombie_villager` - `zombie`, `villager`
-   `fishing_rod_hooked` - `entity`
-   `killed_by_crossbow` - `victims`
-   `player_killed_entity` - `entity`
-   `entity_killed_player` - `entity`
-   `player_hurt_entity` - `entity`
-   `summoned_entity` - `entity`
-   `tame_animal` - `entity`
-   `target_hit` - `projectile`
-   `villager_trade` - `villager`

#### Miscellaneous trigger changes

-   Due to addition of `player`, existing contents of `location`, `slept_in_bed`, `hero_of_the_village`, `voluntary_exile` can now be placed in `location` field instead of top-level object. Old syntax is still supported, but depreciated.
-   `location` got a new property `smokey` which checks if the location is closely above a campfire
-   `entity_properties` got new properties `vehicle` and `targetedEntity` which match the vehicle or the entity targeted by a mob

#### New trigger

-   `target_hit` trigger type
    -   `signal_strength` matches the signal strength output from the block on hit
    -   `projectile` matches the projectile entity
    -   `shooter` matches the player who shot or threw the projectile
-   `item_used_on_block` trigger type
    -   `item` matches the thrown item which was picked up
    -   `entity` matches the entity which picked up the item
-   `player_generates_container_loot` trigger type
    -   `loot_table` matches the resource location of the generated loot table
-   `item_used_on_block` trigger type
    -   `location` matches the location at the center of the block the item was used on
    -   `item` matches the item used on the block

### Attributes

Attributes have been moved to game registry. That means few changes: Renames:

-   Items and entities will no longer keep unknown attributes
-   Names of some attributes have been renamed to meet resource location requirements
-   `generic.maxHealth` 🡆 `generic.max_health`
-   `zombie.spawnReinforcements` 🡆 `zombie.spawn_reinforcements`
-   `horse.jumpStrength` 🡆 `horse.jump_strength`
-   `generic.followRange` 🡆 `generic.follow_range`
-   `generic.knockbackResistance` 🡆 `generic.knockback_resistance`
-   `generic.movementSpeed` 🡆 `generic.movement_speed`
-   `generic.flyingSpeed` 🡆 `generic.flying_speed`
-   `generic.attackDamage` 🡆 `generic.attack_damage`
-   `generic.attackKnockback` 🡆 `generic.attack_knockback`
-   `generic.attackSpeed` 🡆 `generic.attack_speed`
-   `generic.armorToughness` 🡆 `generic.armor_toughness`

### Block placement

-   Ladders and tripwire hooks can now be placed on observers, redstone blocks, and target blocks
-   Doors, rails, buttons, pressure plates, redstone, and more can now be placed on soulsand and full-block of snow layers
-   Soulsand with a rail on top will no longer slow down minecarts

### Block storage

`BlockStates` in `Sections` elements no longer contain values stretching over multiple 64-bit fields. If number of bits per block is not power of two (i.e. single 64-bit value can't fill whole number of blockstates) some bits will not be used. For example, if single block state takes 5 bits, highest 4 bits of every 64-bit field will be unused. That also means slight increase in storage size (in case of 5 bits, from 320 to 342 64-bit fields).

### Block Tags

-   `minecraft:climbable` is now a block tag that allows datapacks to determine which blocks are, well, climbable
-   `minecraft:soul_speed_blocks` is any block that the soul speed enchantment increases speed on

### Chat components

#### Hover event argument

-   `style.hoverEvent` parameter now has parameter `contents`, with contents depending on type:
    -   For `show_text` - chat component
    -   For `show_item` - either item id or object with fields `id`, `count`, and `tag` (with last one being serialized NBT)
    -   For `show_entity` - object with fields: `id` (UUID), `name` (chat component), and `type` (entity type resource location)
-   Old style `value` argument is now deprecated (but still supported)

### Commands

#### attribute

Adds modifies attribute on single entity. Possible syntax: Parameters:

-   `attribute <target> <attribute> get [<scale>]` - get total value of attribute
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> base set <value>` - sets base valye
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> base get [<scale>]` - get base value
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> modifier add <uuid> <name> <value> add|multiply|multiply_base` - adds modifier (fails if modifier is already present)
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> modifier remove <uuid>` - removes modifier
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> modifier value get <uuid> [<scale>]` - get value of modifier
-   `target` - single entity (note: only players, armor stands and mobs have attributes)
-   `attribute` - name of attribute (like `minecraft:generic.max_health`)
-   `name` - string (in optional quotes) describing human-readable name of modifier
-   `value` - floating point value (note: certain attributes have limits on final value, so your change might not be noticeable)

#### locatebiome

New command that locates a specified biome. Useful in creative mode when you're looking for a specific biome and don't want to fly around randomly searching for it. Syntax: `locatebiome <biome>` Parameters:

-   `biome` - The id of the biome to find

#### spawnpoint

The spawnpoint command now supports being run in any dimension.

#### spreadplayers

Added an optional argument to specify maximum height. New syntax: `spreadplayers <center> <spreadDistance> <maxRange> [under <maxHeight>] <respectTeams> <targets>`

-   `maxHeight` - Specifies the maximum height for resulting positions

#### UUIDs in NBT

UUIDs stored in NBT are now represented as an array of four integers. Example: `{UUID:[I;1498693494,1027158888,1898994005,860320107]}` Along with that a couple of fields have been renamed:

-   `OwnerUUID` of tamed animals, area effect clouds, evoker fangs and projectiles is now simply `Owner`
-   `TrustedUUIDs` of foxes is now `Trusted`
-   `target_uuid` of conduits is now `Target`

### Custom Worlds

-   Added experimental support for new custom worlds
-   Edit world screen now has an option to export world settings to a JSON file
-   During world creation you can import previously exported world settings
-   A bunch of new parameters are exposed, but marked as experimental, meaning you can play with them, but there is no guarantee that any of them will continue working (even in the next snapshot!)
-   Flat level preset string lost structure settings (they are now stored in a common format for all worlds), we will restore some form of this functionality soon
-   Buffet world can no longer be created from server.properties, flat level settings changed a bit; better support for custom world creation on the server is coming soon

### Data pack selection

-   Data packs can now be selected before world is created
-   "Re-Create" option will also copy data packs present in source world

### Datapack loading

-   If datapack reload fails, changes will not be applied and game will continue using previous data
-   If existing datapacks prevent world from loading, game will give option to load world in safe mode, which loads only vanilla datapack
-   Changes to datapack list are stored only after successful reload
-   Added `--safeMode` option to server to load only with vanilla datapack
-   Game will now detect critical datapack issues, like missing required tags and prevent world from being loaded

### Effects

-   Increased view distance in lava slightly while having the fire resistance effect

### Entity Broadcasting

It is now possible to control at what range the server sends data about entities to clients.

-   Added an `entity-broadcast-range-percentage` server property controlling how close entities need to be before being sent to clients. Higher values means entities are visible further away from players but cause more network traffic. Specifies percentage of default value, so for example `50` specifies half of the default range

### Fonts

-   `Force Unicode` option now switches between normal and alternative font (called `uniform.json`) – no reload needed

### IO operations

#### Synchronous writes

Region files are now opened in synchronous mode to prevent data loss and corruption after crash. For performance reasons this feature is disabled by default on non-Windows clients. Status of this feature can be manually controlled by following options:

-   For dedicated servers: `sync-chunk-writes` within `server.properties`
-   For clients: `syncChunkWrites` within `options.txt`

#### World save format

-   Saving `level.dat` now uses randomly-named temporary files (instead of using `level.dat_new` every time)
-   `player/*.dat` are now saved in a way similar to `level.dat` (including leaving `.dat_old` files)

### Item frames

#### New tags

-   `Invisible` - makes item frame invisible (item inside frame remains visible)
-   `Fixed` - prevents item frame from being broken and item inside from being removed

### Jigsaw block

-   Jigsaw now can have one of 12 orientations
-   Added new property `Joint type` to describe if attached piece can be rotated (`rollable`) or not (`aligned`)
-   NBT field `target_pool` has been renamed to `pool`
-   `attachement_type` has been split into `name` (on parent block) and `target` (on child block)
-   Added a button in the GUI that generates a jigsaw structure starting from the jigsaw block, using given generation depth

### JMX Monitoring

It is now possible to monitor the server tick times though JMX. The rationale for this is that JMX is a well known and supported monitoring technology with existing integrations and tools. This enables server admins to hook alerts and graphing tools using ordinary JMX clients and dashboards.

#### Enabling JMX Monitoring

-   A new flag `enable-jmx-monitoring` has been added to the server.properties file which if set to `true` will expose an MBean with the Object name `net.minecraft.server:type=Server` and two attributes `averageTickTime` and `tickTimes` exposing the tick times in milliseconds
-   In order for enabling JMX on the Java runtime you also need to add a couple of JVM flags to the startup as documented [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html)

### Loot Tables

#### Entity Predicate

-   Added `fishing_hook` sub-predicate

##### fishing\_hook

Check properties of the fishing hook

###### Parameters

-   `in_open_water` - Matches whether the fishing location is open water fishing or not. A fishing location is considered to be open water if the fishing hook is in water, there are no blocks besides lily pads above water and all water blocks are source blocks with no solid underwater blocks around

### Pack selection screen

-   Packs can now be dropped directly on data and resource pack selection screens
-   Dropped files and directories will be copied to appropriate places

### Particles

-   New particle types: ash, crimson\_spore, soul\_fire\_flame, and warped\_spore
-   New particle types: dripping\_obsidian\_tear, falling\_obsidian\_tear, and landing\_obsidian\_tear
-   New particle type: soul

### Rendering

-   Nailed Entity shadows to the ground
-   Added an Entity Distance scale option ranging from 50% to 500%
-   Added shader support for accessing depth buffer
-   Added new "Fabulous!" graphics option
    -   This uses per-pixel blending layers for some transparent elements

### Smithing recipes

There's now a `smithing` recipe type. Recipes of this type are used in the smithing table to upgrade one item type into another type, maintaining tags.

-   `base` - Ingredient specifying an item to be upgraded
-   `addition` - Ingredient specifying valid items to trigger the upgrade
-   `result` - Item specifying the resulting type of the upgraded item

### Text style

#### Colors

`color` property can now contain RGB value prefixed by `#`. For example `#55ff55` will result in the same color as `green`

#### Custom fonts

Chat component style now supports `font` property, which is resource location for font in resource pack. No entry is equivalent to `minecraft:default`

-   Added "Total Beelocation" for moving a bee nest with 3 bees inside using silk touch

### Bee

We're buzzing with excitement! Can someone tell Cory to stop making bee puns now?

-   Bees are cute, fuzzy, neutral mobs
-   Don't hurt them, they don't want to hurt you
-   If a bee does sting you, it will leave its stinger in you and eventually die, dropping nothing :(
-   Bees love pretty flowers and spend their lives gathering pollen from them
-   After gathering pollen, bees fly back to their home nest
-   Bees help you by growing crops while carrying pollen back to the nest
-   Bees like sharing the location of their favorite flowers with other bees
-   If a bee doesn't have a home nest, it will wander around until it finds one it can use

-   Bees try to avoid water
-   Bees go inside if it's raining at all in the world, not just where the bee is located
-   Bees will search up to 10 blocks away from itself in all directions to find a nest/hive to call home

### Bee Nests / Bee Hives

In real life, bees dance in their nests to show other bees where flowers are!

-   Bee nests spawn naturally in flower forests, plains, and sunflower plains biomes
-   When a bee visits this block and completes its journey undisturbed, the level of honey increases
-   Max of 5 levels of honey
-   Level 5 is quite...sticky
-   Bees use nests and hives to share flower locations with other bees
-   Sometimes bees that already know about a flower will choose not to use this information
-   Bee hives are crafted by players using honeycomb and wood planks
-   Use a silk touch tool to get the block with the bees stored inside
-   Bee nests will be destroyed unless you use silk touch
-   Use shears when at full honey to get honeycomb
-   Use a bottle when at full honey to get a honey bottle
-   Campfire smoke calms bees - place one underneath the nest/hive to keep them in chill mode
-   Redstone-friendly!
-   Bees like bee nests and bee hives the same amount! They don't play favorites :)
-   Bees only exit through the front of the nest/hive

### Dispensers

-   Dispensers can now fill bottles with water and honey
-   Dispensers can now shear honey combs from bee nests and hives
-   Dispensers now eject empty bottles properly when not facing water

### Honey Block

Sticky. Very sticky!

-   Walking and jumping is limited
-   If you stand on a honey block that is pushed by a piston, you come along for the ride
-   Jump into a wall of honey blocks to slide down and slow your fall
-   Landing on a honey block cushions your fall somewhat
-   When a honey block is pushed or pulled by a piston, it sticks to adjacent blocks and tries to move them in the same direction (just like slime blocks do)
-   Honey blocks and slime blocks don't stick to each other, because... um.... because of special Minecraft chemistry
-   Mobs and animals dislike walking on honey blocks unless they really need to as it's too sticky for their comfort
-   Honey blocks are crafted from four honey bottles

### Honey Bottle

Organic, gluten-free, delicious locally-farmed honey!

-   Use an empty glass bottle on a hive or nest that is full of honey to get a bottle of honey!
-   Drink it!
-   ???
-   Profit!
-   Oh yeah, also craft it into sugar!
-   Or craft four bottles into a honey block!
-   Drinking honey also cures poison

### Honeycomb

Disclaimer: Cannot be used to comb your hair

-   Shear a full-honey hive or nest to obtain
-   Craft with wood planks to create a bee hive

### Honeycomb Block

BYOH - Build Your Own Honeycomb

-   Craft 2x2 Honeycomb to get a honeycomb block
-   Purely decorative!

### Iron Golems

-   Loot table predicates can now be defined in separate files and used for entity selectors and in `execute if` command
-   Extended advancement and loot table predicates

### Advancements

-   Changes in item predicate:
    -   `enchantments` now only matches enchantments on item itself - it can no longer be used for enchanted books
    -   to match contents enchanted book, use `stored_enchantments`

#### Entity Predicate

##### `player`

Entity predicate now accepts `player` field, which checks player properties. Fails when entity is not player.

###### Fields:

-   `level` - range of allowed player levels
-   `gamemode` - same values as `/gamemode` command
-   `stats` - list of statistics to match. Entry fields: `type` (like `minecraft:custom`), `stat` (like `minecraft:sneak_time`) and `value` (int range)
-   `recipes` - map of recipe ids. Boolean value tells if it should or should not be known to player
-   `advancements` - map of advancement ids. If value is boolean, checks if advancement is done. If value is object, checks completion of critera

##### `team`

Entity predicate now accepts `team` field, which matches team name.

#### Location predicate

##### `block` and `fluid`

Predicate also accepts `block` and `fluid` sub-predicate. Available fields:

-   `block`/`fluid` - exact block/fluid id to match
-   `tag` - block/fluid tag to match
-   `nbt` - matcher for block entity NBT (only for blocks)
-   `state` - map of name-value properties. Value can be integer, boolean or string or object with optional `min` and `max` properties

##### `light`

Predicate now accepts `light` sub-predicate. Object has one integer range - `light` that matches visible light (`max(sky-darkening,block)`).

### Chat components

#### Click action

-   Added `copy_to_clipboard` action to `clickEvent`

#### NBT chat component

-   Added variant for NBT storage: `{"nbt": <path>, "storage":"<resource id>"}`. NBT storage can be manipulated with commands like `/data merge storage <resource id> ...`

### Commands

#### `data`

-   Data commands can now use `storage` as target. This is general-purpose, key-value storage
    -   Storage is shared between all dimensions in level
    -   Data in storage persist between reloads

#### `execute if predicate`

New subcommand evaluates custom predicates (defined in `predicates` directory of datapack).

#### `schedule`

-   Added new syntax `/schedule ... [append|replace]` (`/schedule ...` defaults to `replace`)
-   Added new syntax `/schedule clear <id>` to remove existing schedules (returns number of removed schedules)

#### effect

The `effect clear` command now defaults to `@s` if no target argument is given.

#### Entity selectors

New selector parameter `predicate` allows to apply custom custom predicate (defined in `predicates` directory of datapack).

#### kill

The `kill` command now defaults to `@s` if no target argument is given.

#### Spectate

New command that makes a player in spectator mode spectate an entity. Syntax: `spectate [target] [player]` Parameters:

-   `player` - The player that should spectate the target. Must be in spectator mode. If omitted, `@s` is used
-   `target` - The target to spectate. If omitted, makes the player stop spectating

### Custom predicates

New parameters added:

-   `offsetX`, `offsetY`, `offsetZ` - optional offsets to location

#### `time_check` condition

New condition that checks day time.

##### Parameters

-   `value` - range of accepted values
-   `period` - if present, time will be modulo-divided by this value (for example, if set to 24000, `value` will operate on time of day)

#### New conditions

##### `reference`

Includes condition defined in `predicates` directory of datapack, selected with `name` parameter.

#### New functions

##### `copy_state`

Copies state properties from dropped block to `BlockStateTag` in dropped item.

###### Parameters

-   `block` - source of properties (block id)
-   `properties` - list of property names. All must be present on `block`

### Modding

In an effort to help make modding the game easier, we have decided to publish our game obfuscation maps with all future releases of the game. This means that anyone who is interested may deobfuscate the game and find their way around the code without needing to spend a few months figuring out what's what. It is our hope that mod authors and mod framework authors use these files to augment their updating processes that they have today. These mappings will always be available, instantly and immediately as part of every newly released version. This does not, however, change the existing restrictions on what you may or may not do with our game code or assets. The links to the obfuscation mappings are included as part of the version manifest json, and may be automatically pulled for any given version. Prefixed to every obfuscation map is the following legal disclaimer:

> (c) 2019 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. This information is provided "as-is" and you bear the risk of using it. This information does not provide you with any legal rights to any intellectual property in any Microsoft product. You may copy and use this information for your internal, reference purposes. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

### Particle Performance

-   Vertically moving particles are performing better when they collide with blocks

### Pistons

#### Bug fix

-   Blocks that can be manually placed on farmland can now also be pushed onto it by a piston without destroying the farmland

### Resource Packs

-   The resource pack version is now 5
-   The game now tries to make out of date resource packs work as much as possible
-   Increased sizelimit for client downloading resource packs from 50MB to 100MB

### State matching

Few advancements and loot table predicates that used block state properties (`location`, `block_state_property`, `enter_block`, `placed_block`) can now match ranges (by replacing single value with `{"min": ..., "max": ...}`). Also, block type is now optional in those predicates - so for example it is not possible to match any crop with `age` property in certain range.

### Textures

-   Changed texture map for all chests
-   Banner and shield patterns are now using alpha channel instead of brightness
-   Ender Dragon does not have separate texture for the bottom of the wing anymore
-   Enchanted item glint texture is now like it looks in the game

#### Command used to change the patterns

-   `for f in *.png; do convert "$f" -alpha copy tmp.png && composite tmp.png -compose copy-opacity ../shield_base.png tmp2.png && convert tmp2.png -fill "rgba(0,1,0,1)" -draw "rectangle 0,0 1,63" -draw "rectangle 2,0 63,1" -draw "rectangle 2,22 64,64" -draw "rectangle 12,2 64,64" -fill none -draw "matte 0,0 floodfill" tmp3.png && mv tmp3.png "$f" && rm tmp.png tmp2.png; done`

### Advancements

-   Entity type predicates now accept tags (`#baz`)

#### Damage source predicate

-   Damage source predicate now has option: `is_lightning`

#### Entity equipment predicate

-   Entity predicate now accepts `equipment` field
-   This predicate can contain up to six fields: `head`, `chest`, `legs`, `feet`, `mainhand`, `offhand`
-   If this predicate is non-null, test will fail for entities that have no equipment (i.e. not mobs, players or armor stands)

#### Entity flags predicate

-   Entity predicate now accepts `flags` field
-   Available tests: `is_on_fire`, `is_sneaking`, `is_sprinting`, `is_swimming`, `is_baby`

### Chat components

#### NBT chat component

-   Block variant `{"nbt": <path>, "block":"<coordinates>"}`, where `<coordinates>` field uses same format as `/setblock`
-   Entity variant `{"nbt": <path>, "entity":<selector>}`, where `selector` field uses same format as `/kill`
-   Additionaly, if field `interpret` is present and set to `true`, contents of selected tags will be interpreted as chat components
-   Works same as selector components:
    -   if there are no elements, returns empty string
    -   if there are multiple elements, merges them with `,`

### Commands

-   `type` field in `@` selectors now accepts entity type tags (`type=#foo` and `type=!#bar`)
-   Item frame contents can now be modified with `/replaceitem`

#### `data`

-   `data modify <block or entity> <path> <operation> <source>`
    -   Apply operation to selected fields
    -   Basic operation: `set` - replaces value
    -   List operations: `insert <index> | prepend | append`
    -   Object operations: `merge`
    -   Sources:
        -   `from <block or entity> <path>` - copies value from existing tag
        -   `value <nbt>` - uses NBT literal

#### `execute`

-   `execute if data <block or entity> <path>` (and `execute unless`)
    -   when used as command, return count of matched elements
    -   when used as part of command, continues on non-zero(`if`) or zero(`unless`) count

#### `loot`

General syntax: `loot <target> <source>`

##### Sources

-   `fish <loot table id> <fishing location> [tool <item>|mainhand|offhand]` - uses fishing context
-   `loot <loot table id>` - uses loot chest context (can be also used for advancement awards and cat gifts)
-   `kill <entity selector>` - simulates entity drops
-   `mine <mining location> [tool <item>|mainhand|offhand]` - simulates block drops

##### Targets

-   `spawn <position>` - drops in world
-   `replace` - works similar to `/replaceitem`. If `count` is missing, command will try to place all returned items. If `count` is higher than number of items, remaining slots will be cleared.
    -   `entity <entity selector> <start slot> [<count>]` - replaces range of slots.
    -   `block <position> <start slot> [<count>]` - replaces range of slots.
-   `give <player selector>` - inserts items into player's inventory (similar to `/give`)
-   `insert <position>` - inserts items into container (similar to shift left-click)

#### `schedule`

Schedules function or tag to run in `<time>` gametime ticks. Returns trigger time. Any tag or function can be scheduled only once. Calling this command for already scheduled function or tag will replace older record.

#### `teammsg`

General syntax: `teammsg <message>` Sends `<message>` to all players on the team of the player who runs the command. Available to all players on a team.

##### Alias

-   `tm <message>`

#### NBT paths

-   Can now return multiple values. When used as target, modification will be applied to every element
-   When setting location and no elements are found, new matching element will be created:
    -   For example writing to `Items[{Slot:10b}]` will either found element in `Items` for slot 10 or create new one
-   Add `[{k1:v1,k2:v2}]` to match objects in list that have matching fields
-   Add `{k1:v1,k2:v2}` to match objects (selects 0 or 1 elements, mostly as safeguard against mismatched entries)
    -   _Note:_ this also works with root object: `{}` is valid path for referencing root object
-   Allow negative indices in `[index]` to select element from end (i.e. `[-1]` is last element, `[-2]` second to last, etc)
-   Add `[]` to select all elements from list

### Dedicated server

#### `server.properties`

-   `difficulty` and `gamemode` settings now accept string names (integer values are still allowed as legacy option)
-   Server will exit faster is `eula.txt` is not set

#### Command line

-   Added new option `--help`. Not going to tell you what it does.
-   New command line option `initSettings` initializes `eula.txt` and `server.properties` with defaults, then exits

### Light engine

We are de-lighted to have a new light engine!

-   Moved light storage from chunks to a separate structure
-   Moved light calculation from all over the code to a self-contained place
-   Moved light computation off the main thread (on the server)
-   Added support for directional opacity of blocks (used by slabs, stairs, snow layers, non-full-block dirt-related blocks and extended piston base blocks)
-   Also made enchanting table, end portal frame block and piston base block block light correctly

### Loot tables

**Note:** Some functions and predicates (like `set_name`, `set_lore`, `fill_player_head`, `entity_properties`) accept entity target parameter. Possible values are:

-   Block drops are now controlled by loot tables (stored in `loot_tables/blocks/`)
-   Tables and pools accept functions
-   Added new loot table entry types: `dynamic`, `tag`, `alternatives`, `sequence`, `group`
-   Added new loot table functions: `apply_bonus`, `explosion_decay`, `copy_name`, `limit_count`, `set_contents`, `set_loot_table`, `set_lore`, `fill_player_head`, `copy_nbt`
-   Added new loot table conditions: `survives_explosion`, `block_state_property`, `table_bonus`, `match_tool`, `damage_source_properties`, `location_check`, `weather_check` and two special modifiers: `inverted` and `alternative`
-   Integer values can now specify random number generator (available types: `constant`, `uniform`, `binomial`). If omitted, defaults to uniform
-   Loot tables have optional `type`, used to validate function usage (available types: `empty`, `chest`, `fishing`, `entity`, `advancement_reward`, `block`). Using function that references data not available in given context (for example, block state in fishing table) will cause warning
-   New entity parameter in predicates: `direct_killer` - allows access to projectiles etc.
-   `this` - usually entity performing action
-   `killer_player`
-   `killer` - primary source of damage
-   `direct_killer` - direct source of damage (may be different than `killer` - for example, when killing with bow, `killer` will be bow user, while `direct_killer` will be arrow entity)
