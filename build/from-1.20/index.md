    -   Suspicious Sand can be found in Desert Temples, Desert Wells and Warm Ocean Ruins
    -   Suspicious Gravel can be found in Cold Ocean Ruins and Trail Ruins
    -   These fragile blocks are hard to spot and easy to destroy, so be careful!
    -   Brushing Suspicious Sand or Suspicious Gravel with a Brush will extract objects that were buried long ago
-   Added the Trail Ruins, a buried structure from a lost culture
    -   Four types of Armor Trim Templates can be found here
    -   Trail Ruins can be found in Taigas, Snowy Taigas, all Old Growth forest biomes and Jungles
    -   A new music disc can be found by brushing suspicious blocks in this structure
        -   When put in a Jukebox, "Relic" by Aaron Cherof is played
-   Added Pottery Sherds

    -   A total of 20 sherd have been distributed between the 5 Archaeology sites: Desert Wells, Desert Temples, Cold Ocean Ruins, Warm Ocean Ruins, and Trail Ruins
    -   They cannot be crafted, and are only found by brushing Suspicious Sand or Suspicious Gravel

#### Decorated Pots

-   Crafting four Pottery Sherds together will create a Decorated Pot with a picture on each side
-   Brick items can be used instead of Pottery Sherds in the Decorated Pot recipe
    -   The sides that were made from Brick items will not have pictures
-   Smash a Decorated Pot with any block-breaking tool to break it apart and get the Pottery Sherds back
    -   Hitting the pot with bare hands, silk touch tools, or any other item will drop an intact pot instead
-   Crafted Decorated Pots with at least one pattern have a hover tooltip displaying the Sherd & Brick ingredients

### Sniffer

-   The Sniffer is the mob vote winner of Minecraft Live 2022
-   Sniffers are passive, friendly mobs
-   Sniffers sniff the air and occasionally dig for seeds, which produces a Torchflower Seed or a Pitcher Pod item
-   Sniffers can only dig grass and dirt-like blocks
-   Sniffers can be tempted by, and bred with Torchflowers Seeds

#### Sniffer Egg

-   Can be found by brushing the Suspicious Sand of Warm Ocean Ruins
-   When two Sniffers breed they do not immediately spawn a Snifflet; instead, a Sniffer Egg is dropped
-   When placed in the world, the Sniffer Egg will hatch after some time
    -   When placed on Moss, the Egg will hatch in approximately 10 minutes
    -   On all other blocks, it will hatch in approximately 20 minutes

#### Torchflowers

-   The Sniffer can occasionally sniff up a Torchflowers seed, and it can be used to breed two Sniffers
-   The Torchflower seed can be planted on Farmland and grows into a Torchflower
-   The full-grown flower can be harvested and replanted
-   The Torchflower can be crafted into Orange Dye

#### Pitcher Plant

-   The Sniffer can occasionally sniff up a Pitcher Pod item
-   The Pitcher Pod, when planted on Farmland, grows into a Pitcher Crop
-   The Pitcher Crop has five growth stages
-   Once fully grown, the Pitcher Crop can be harvested, yielding a two-block-tall Pitcher Plant
-   The Pitcher Plant can be crafted into Cyan Dye

### Camel

-   Camels can be equipped with a Saddle and ridden by two players
-   Camels spawn naturally when Desert Villages generate
-   Camels can be tempted by holding Cactus
-   Feed Cactus to Camels to breed them
-   Camels are tall
    -   Most hostile mobs will not be able to reach you when you are on a Camel
    -   They can walk over Fences and Walls
-   Camels randomly sit down
    -   While sitting, it is difficult to convince them to move
-   Camels can either walk slowly or sprint quickly
-   They can also dash forward but will lose stamina for a while when doing so

### Smithing

-   Smithing Tables have been redesigned into a workstation for physical equipment upgrades and modifications
-   Alongside slots for combining a piece of equipment and materials, there is now a required slot for an item type called Smithing Template
-   Smithing Templates define what type of upgrade you will be making to a piece of equipment
    -   It specifies both what type of items you can upgrade, and which ingredients are valid to customize the upgrade
    -   There are currently two categories of Smithing Templates: Armor Trim and Netherite Upgrade
-   Smithing Templates are consumed when used to upgrade an item in the Smithing Table
-   You can craft a copy of a Smithing Template in the Crafting Table with 7 diamonds + 1 block of material that the template is made out of + 1 smithing template, which will output 2 of the same Smithing Template

#### Netherite Equipment

-   Netherite equipment crafting now also requires a Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template
-   Netherite Upgrade Smithing Templates can be found randomly in all Bastion Remnant chests
    -   Every Treasure Room Bastion Remnant will contain 2 Smithing Templates
-   This change was made for a variety of reasons:
    -   Increase the time players utilize Diamond equipment before Netherite
    -   Make Netherite equipment more significant achievement in the game's progression
    -   Adapt Netherite more naturally into the new Smithing Table crafting system

#### Armor Trims

-   You can now visually customize your armor with a variety of unique trims at the Smithing Table
-   Armor trims are purely visual with no gameplay benefits
-   Armor trims can be applied to Helmets, Chestplates, Leggings and Boots
    -   All trim patterns are visually the same on an armor's item icon, but the color will still change based on the trim material
    -   To check which trim pattern a piece of armor has, you can hover over it in the inventory
-   Armor Trim Smithing Templates can be found all throughout the world, and each of the following structures contain their own unique Smithing Templates:
    -   Trail Ruins: Wayfinder, Raiser, Shaper, and Host Armor Trims
    -   Pillager Outpost: Sentry Armor Trim
    -   Desert Pyramid: Dune Armor Trim
    -   Shipwreck: Coast Armor Trim
    -   Jungle Temple: Wild Armor Trim
    -   Ocean Monument: Tide Armor Trim
    -   Ancient City: Ward and Silence Armor Trims
    -   Woodland Mansion: Vex Armor Trim
    -   Nether Fortress: Rib Armor Trim
    -   Bastion Remnant: Snout Armor Trim
    -   Stronghold: Eye Armor Trim
    -   End City: Spire Armor Trim
-   Smithing Templates are found in chests in their respective structure
    -   Trail Ruins have no chests, Smithing Templates are instead found by brushing Suspicious Gravel
    -   The Ocean Monument has no chests, Elder Guardians sometimes instead drop a Smithing Template upon death
-   Some Armor Trim Smithing Templates are rarer than others, so be on the lookout for them to impress your friends!
-   An armor trim has two properties: a pattern and a material
    -   The pattern is defined by the Smithing Template used to apply the trim, and represents the visual pattern of the trim
    -   The material is defined by which ingredient you used to apply the trim, and controls the color of the trim
-   The viable ingredients you can use to define the color of your armor trim are the following:
    -   Iron, Copper, Gold, Lapis, Emerald, Diamond, Netherite, Redstone, Amethyst, Quartz

### Cherry Groves

-   Added a new Cherry Grove biome, with pretty cherry blossom trees
    -   The biome can be found in the mountains, in similar places as Meadows
-   Added a new Cherry wood set, with all the corresponding wooden things you can craft from it
-   Pink particles fall from beneath Cherry Leaves
-   Added a new Pink Petals block with lots of pink flowers on the ground
    -   Each Pink Petal block can contain up to 4 petals
    -   Using Bone Meal on it increases the number of petals
    -   Placing a Pink Petal into an already placed block increases the number of petals
    -   Drops the number of petals in the block when mined

### Bamboo Wood Set

-   Added a new Bamboo wood set, with all the corresponding wooden things you can craft from it
-   Block of Bamboo can be crafted from 9 Bamboo and can be stripped like other wood logs
-   Bamboo Planks crafted from Block of Bamboo yield only 2 planks compared to 4 for wood logs
-   Added a new "Mosaic" plank variant that is unique to Bamboo called the Bamboo Mosaic
    -   It can be crafted with 1x2 Bamboo Slabs in a vertical strip
    -   You can craft Stair and Slab variants of Bamboo Mosaic
    -   Bamboo Mosaic blocks cannot be used as a crafting ingredient where other wooden blocks are used, but they can be used as fuel
-   Added a unique Bamboo Raft and Bamboo Chest Raft which can be crafted like normal boats, but with Bamboo Planks
    -   They function the same as ordinary boats, but have a unique look to them

### Chiseled Bookshelf

-   A new, chiseled variation of the Bookshelf
-   Crafted with 6 planks and 3 wooden slabs
-   Can store Books, Book and Quills, Written Books, Enchanted Books, and Knowledge Books
    -   Holds up to 6 books
    -   These can be added or removed from any slot by targeting the specific slot
-   The Comparator signal strength corresponds to the number of the last book that was inserted or removed
    -   The numbering of book slots starts from 1 at the top-left, and increments from left-to-right
-   Works with Hoppers

### Hanging Signs

-   Hanging Signs are a more expensive version of normal Signs
    -   Crafted with 2 chains and 6 stripped logs of your preferred wood type
    -   Crafting results in 6 Hanging Signs
-   Can be hung up in the following ways:
    -   Underneath a block that can provide support in the center, like a full block or a fence
    -   Attached to the solid side of a block
    -   Attached to the side or underneath another Hanging Sign
-   Unlike normal Signs, they cannot be placed directly on the ground without support from the side or above
    -   However, Hanging Signs that have a horizontal bar will not pop when the supporting block is removed

### Signs

The following changes have been made for both Signs and Hanging Signs.

-   Sign text can now be edited after being placed in the world
    -   This can be done by interacting with the Sign
    -   Signs with non-text chat components can not be edited
-   Both sides of the Sign can now have separate text and colors, allowing for further customization options
    -   By default, a Sign will prompt you to input the front side's text when placed
    -   To apply text to the back-side, you must walk to the other side and interact with that face to edit it
-   Signs can now also be waxed with Honeycomb, preventing any further edits to its text
-   Opening the sign edit screen in singleplayer no longer pauses the game

### Calibrated Sculk Sensors

-   A new variant of Sculk Sensors that allows you to filter vibrations based on their frequency level
-   They are not found naturally and can only be crafted with 1 Sculk Sensor and 3 Amethyst Shards in the Crafting Table
-   One side of the Calibrated Sculk Sensor can receive a redstone signal as input
    -   The strength of that redstone signal is the only vibration frequency the Sculk Sensor will listen to
-   They have a combined active and cooldown phase that lasts 20 game ticks
    -   They output their redstone signal for the first 10 game ticks
-   They can detect vibrations up to 16 blocks away

### Vibration Resonance

-   Blocks of Amethyst have a new behavior when placed adjacent to Sculk Sensors
    -   If that Sculk Sensor receives a vibration, the Block of Amethyst will re-emit its frequency as a separate vibration at its location
-   This behavior is called Vibration Resonance, and allows players to move vibration frequencies across long distances without having to recreate the vibration naturally

### Playable Mob Sounds

-   When placing a Mob Head on a Note Block, that Note Block will now play one of the ambient sounds of that mob when played by a player or powered by Redstone
-   Mob Heads can be placed on top of Note Blocks without sneaking

### Piglin Mob Head

-   Piglins will now drop their heads when killed by a charged Creeper
-   Placing the Piglin head on a Note Block will play one of the Piglin's ambient sounds
-   The Piglin head will flap its ears when powered by Redstone, or when worn by a player while walking

### New Music

-   Added the following new music tracks by Aaron Cherof to Cherry Groves, Desert, Jungle, Badlands, and Flower Forest biomes:
    -   A Familiar Room
    -   Bromeliad
    -   Crescent Dunes
    -   Echo in the Wind
-   Added a new music disc with the track "Relic" by Aaron Cherof, found in Trail Ruins

### Windows Aarch64/ARM64 support

    -   Added the ability to scroll upwards by pressing the `up arrow` key
-   The game will now display a message box on startup if user enabled text-to-speech functionality, but it is not available
-   Removed Herobrine

### Sculk Changes

-   If a vibration is scheduled to be received by a Sculk Sensor or Sculk Shrieker, they will stay queued until all adjacent chunks are loaded and ticking
    -   Prevents vibration resonance setups from breaking when unloading their chunks from a distance
-   Waterlogging a Sculk Shrieker will now silence their shriek sounds
-   Sculk Sensors' default redstone output has been modified to be more reliable for distance calculations
-   Sculk Sensors and Calibrated Sculk Sensors now strongly power the block they are placed on
-   Both types of Sculk Sensors now stay in their Cooldown phase for 10 ticks, with other phase timings being adjusted to compensate

#### Sculk Sensor Phases

-   Sculk Sensors and Calibrated Sculk Sensors have three phases: Inactive, Active and Cooldown
-   The default phase is Inactive
    -   This phase lasts indefinitely until the block receives a vibration
    -   During this phase, the block is able to listen to nearby vibrations until one has been scheduled
-   When a scheduled vibration is received, the block switches to the Active phase
    -   This phase lasts 30 game ticks for Sculk Sensors, and 10 game ticks for Calibrated Sculk Sensors
    -   During this phase, the block stops listening to nearby vibrations, wiggles its tendrils and emits a redstone signal and light
-   After the Active phase has finished, the block switches to a Cooldown phase
    -   This phase lasts for 10 game ticks
    -   During this phase, the block keeps wiggling its tendrils, but no longer emits a redstone signal nor light
    -   Finally, once this phase is finished, the block will switch back to the Inactive phase
-   Previously, some of these phases had different timing values:
    -   Active: 40 game ticks for Sculk Sensors and 20 game ticks for Calibrated Sculk Sensors
    -   Cooldown: 1 game tick for both types of Sculk Sensors
-   These phase timings were tweaked so that it is less common for activated contraptions to recursively activate the Sculk Sensor that powered them

#### Vibration Frequencies

In preparation for the Calibrated Sculk Sensor, vibration frequencies have been greatly simplified to prevent unwanted interference. The following are category descriptions for each frequency and the expected events that they correspond to:

1.  Movement in any medium (land, water and air)
2.  Landing on any surface (land or water)
3.  Item interactions
4.  Gliding with an elytra or unique mob actions (Ravager roar, Wolf shaking, etc)
5.  Dismounting a mob or equipping gear
6.  Mounting a mob or interacting with a mob
7.  Mobs and players getting damaged
8.  Consuming items (drinking and eating)
9.  Blocks 'deactivating' (door close, chest close, button unpress, etc)
10.  Blocks 'activating' (door open, chest open, button press, etc)
11.  Blocks changing (cauldron water level rising, adding food to campfire, etc.)
12.  Blocks being destroyed
13.  Blocks being placed
14.  Mobs and players teleporting or spawning
15.  Mobs and players dying or an explosion

### Step Sounds

-   Walking on a block will now always play a step sound
    -   It was previously not the case if you were walking along the edge of a block with air or fluid besides it
-   Walking on the ocean floor will produce a step sound for the block you are walking on at a lower volume and pitch
-   When walking on Carpets, Snow, Nether Sprouts, Warped Roots, and Crimson Roots, a combination of step sounds will be played
    -   The top-most block you are walking on is played as normal
    -   The block underneath is played at a lower volume and pitch

### Advancements

-   Breeding Camels and Sniffers now count for "The Parrots and the Bats" and are now required for "Two by Two"
-   Hanging Signs now count for "Glow and Behold"
-   Visiting a Cherry Grove is now required for "Adventuring Time"

## Technical Changes

-   Improved performance of the light engine
-   The data pack version is now 15, accounting for sign data format, item display orientation and advancement changes
-   Removed `update_1_20` feature flag and built-in datapack - features are no longer experimental
-   Added a `return` command
-   Tweaked display entity interpolation
-   Added a `capped` rule structure processor that limits the number of replaced blocks for a structure piece to a configured maximum
-   Configuring block entity fields in a `rule` processor rule is now delegated to a referenced `block_entity_modifier` instead of the previously fixed `output_nbt` configuration
-   Random sequences for loot tables are now deterministic
-   Added a `reference` loot table function
-   Loot table condition/predicate changes:
    -   Renamed `alternative` to `any_of`
    -   Added `all_of`
-   Advancement trigger changes:
    -   Added `recipe_crafted`
    -   Changed format of `placed_block`, `item_used_on_block` and `allay_drop_item_on_block` triggers
-   Ingredients in array form are now also allowed in `smithing_trim` and `smithing_transform` recipes on fields `template`, `base` and `addition`
    -   Those fields also allow empty arrays, which signalize that slot needs to be left empty
-   Added new damage types: `outside_border` and `generic_kill`
-   Game events have changed vibration frequency and some have been removed
-   The resource pack version is now 15, accounting for the font and credits update
    -   Updated the sprite layout of `minecraft.png`
    -   Removed the overriding `minecraft.png` from the Programmer Art resource pack
    -   Updated the sprite layout of `invite_icon.png`
    -   `legacy_unicode` glyph provider has been removed
    -   Bitmaps used by `uniform` font have been removed
    -   `uniform` font has been updated to use Unifont 15.0.06
        -   That changes shape of multiple characters, while also adding support for new ones
        -   Combining characters no longer include circle overlayed over them (so M◌̆ now renders as M ̆)
    -   Added second level of organization of entries in credits.json on top of `titles`, called `disciplines`
-   Font textures are included in debug texture dump (F3 + S)
-   Added new font glyph providers: `unihex` and `reference`, removed `legacy_unicode`
-   Added support for Quick Play
-   Removed the `server` & `port` commandline arguments as their functionality has been replaced by Quick Play
-   Updates to telemetry
-   Changed encoding of `server.properties` to UTF-8
-   Added validation for symbolic links in world saves

### Light Engine

The light engine is responsible for calculating the brightness of each block in the world. Light is calculated during world generation as well as updated when a block is changed in the world. Behavior of the light engine has not been changed.

-   The performance of calculating light has been improved
    -   Reduces one source of lag spikes when crossing chunk borders
    -   Improves FPS in situations when a lot of light updates occur
    -   Improves how quickly chunks can be generated

### Commands

#### `return`

The `return` command can be used to control execution flow inside functions and change their return value. Effects:

-   Remaining separate top-level commands in the currently executing function (if any) are skipped
-   The result value of the `function` command that triggered the function is changed from the number of commands executed to `value`
-   The result value of the `return` command is also `value`

Syntax:

`return <value>`

Parameters:

-   `value`: An integer return value

#### `data`

-   `string` data sources now accept negative boundaries, which are interpreted as index counted from the end of the string

### Display Entity

#### Interpolation Changes

-   Previous values are always discarded if `interpolation_duration` is `0`
-   Made sure that render properties are applied at the same time (so `block_state` is applied at the same time as transformation, i.e. at the next tick after receiving an update)
-   Display entities are not rendered until their initial data is received. That means display entities might not be shown on the first tick.
-   Note: due to how the game handles updates, changes to entities made after summoning might be delivered to clients within a later tick

#### Rendering Changes

-   `item_display` items have been rotated 180 degrees around the Y axis to better match the transformation that is applied when rendering items on an Armor Stand head and in Item Frames
    -   For reference, the order of transformations applied to model (starting from innermost) is `item_transform`, rotate Y 180, `transformation` field, entity orientation (billboard option + `Rotation` field + `Pos` field)

### Structure post-processors

#### Capped post-processor

-   A `capped` post-processor has been added which can limit how many blocks a delegated post-processor randomly transform in a structure
-   This can be used to configure a structure piece to have an exact amount of specific blocks, instead of using random distribution
-   The `capped` post-processor has following required parameters:
    -   `delegate` A post-processor which performs the actual block transformation
    -   `limit` Maximum amount of blocks that the delegated post-processor can transform
        -   The blocks inside a structure are all randomly passed to the delegated post-processor until it has transformed the limited amount
        -   Either constant or random number generator sampled during post-processing

#### Rule post-processor block entity configuration

-   Previously a rule could specify an optional fixed `output_nbt` which would be added to the processed output block entity
-   This field has now been changed to reference a `block_entity_modifier`
-   Existing `block_entity_modifier`'s are:
    -   `passthrough` Retains existing fields on the block entity
        -   This is the default if no `block_entity_modifier` is specified
    -   `append_static` Similar to previous `output_nbt` this provides fixed fields to add to the block entity
        -   A minor change is that this modifier appends configured fields to the processed block instead of replacing existing fields
    -   `clear` Removes any existing fields on the block entity
    -   `append_loot` Appends a loot table and seed to the block entity through required parameter:
        -   `loot_table` Referenced loot table to add to block entity as `LootTable` field
        -   Field `LootTableSeed` is also added to the block entity using random seeded by block position

### Loot Tables

#### Random Sequences

The game now uses named random sequences to deterministically produce loot for loot tables. Each random sequence produces a unique sequence based on the world seed and sequence ID, which means a loot table will produce the same results when ran with the same parameters in the same world.

The ID of the random sequence to use for a loot table is specified in a new optional field called `random_sequence`. If no sequence name is given, loot is drawn using a non-deterministic random source.

#### `reference`

New function `reference` allows functions to call sub-functions (similar to `reference` condition).

Fields:

-   `name` - location of function to call

#### `any_of`/`all_of`

-   Loot condition `alternative` has been renamed to `any_of`
-   Added new loot condition `all_of` that passes only when all sub-conditions pass
    -   Has the same syntax as `any_of`

### Advancements

#### New Triggers

##### `recipe_crafted`

-   Triggered when crafting a recipe
-   Conditions:
    -   `recipe_id` - the resource location of the recipe crafted
    -   `ingredients` - an array of predicates for the item stacks used in the recipe
        -   A single item stack can only be used to fulfill one predicate
        -   Each predicate needs to be fulfilled to trigger the advancement. This allows for separation between recipes that have same identifier but use different ingredients.
        -   This field is optional. When not provided, or left empty, only the `recipe_id` will dictate the success of the trigger

#### Changed Triggers

-   All fields in `placed_block`, `item_used_on_block` and `allay_drop_item_on_block` have been collapsed into a single `location` field
-   The new `location` is similar to the `player` field - it is a list of loot conditions/predicates
-   All conditions in this list must match for a trigger to run
-   Conditions are evaluated in a new loot context called `advancement_location`. It has access to:
    -   Player as `this` entity
    -   Position of the placed block
    -   Block state of the placed/interacted block
    -   Held/used item as "tool"
-   Migration guide:
    -   Contents of old `location` field should be migrated to `location_check` condition
    -   Contents of `item` field should be migrated to `match_tool` condition
    -   Contents of `block` + `state` fields should be migrated to `block_state_property` condition

**Example** (from `make_a_sign_glow` advancement):

Before:

    {
        "conditions": {
            "item": {
                "items": [
                    "minecraft:glow_ink_sac"
                ]
            },
            "location": {
                "block": {
                    "tag": "minecraft:all_signs"
                }
            }
        },
        "trigger": "minecraft:item_used_on_block"
    }
    

After:

    {
        "conditions": {
            "location": [
                {
                    "condition": "minecraft:match_tool",
                    "predicate": {
                        "items": [
                            "minecraft:glow_ink_sac"
                        ]
                    }
                },

                    }
                }
            ]
        },
        "trigger": "minecraft:item_used_on_block"
    }
    

### Damage Types

-   Players outside the world border are now hurt by the damage type `outside_border` instead of `in_wall`
-   Forcibly removing an entity using the `/kill` command now uses damage type `generic_kill` instead of `out_of_world`

### Tags

#### Block Tags

-   Removed `replaceable_plants` since it was only used as a subset of the blocks for the tag above, and not as universally
-   Added `replaceable_by_trees` to better express blocks that are replaced when the tree grows through them
-   Added `replaceable` with all the blocks that can be replaced
    -   This tag only represents the internal state of the game, changing this tag does not make blocks replaceable
-   Added `sword_efficient` to represent blocks that are broken 50% faster by a sword than normal
-   Added `maintains_farmland` to represent which blocks will not cause farmland to be converted into dirt due to drying out when placed on top of it

-   Added `enchantment_power_transmitter` to control which blocks are allowed between an Enchantment Table and a Bookshelf (or other Power Transmitter)
-   Added `vibration_resonators` to control which blocks transmit vibration signals when placed next to Sculk Sensors
-   Added `trail_ruins_replaceable` for blocks that Trail Ruins can replace when generating
-   Added `sniffer_diggable_block` to control which blocks Sniffers can dig
-   Added `sniffer_egg_hatch_boost` to that control on which blocks Sniffer Eggs hatch twice as fast
-   Added `ceiling_hanging_signs`
-   Added `wall_hanging_signs`
-   Added `all_hanging_signs`
-   Added `stone_buttons` block tag

-   Added `decorated_pot_ingredients`
-   Added `decorated_pot_sherds`
-   Added `sniffer_food`
-   Added `trimmable_armor`
-   Added `trim_materials`
-   Added `trim_templates`
-   Added `stone_buttons` item tag
-   Added `cherry_logs` item tag
-   Added `bamboo_blocks` item tag

### Game Events

-   Removed `piston_contract` game event in favor of `block_deactivate`
-   Removed `piston_extend` and `dispense_fail` game events in favor of `block_activate`
-   Many game events have new vibration frequencies:
    -   1: `step`, `swim`, `flap`
    -   2: `projectile_land`, `hit_ground`, `splash`
    -   3: `item_interact_finish`, `projectile_shoot`, `instrument_play`

    -   14: `entity_place`, `lightning_strike`, `teleport`
    -   15: `entity_die`, `explode`

### Fonts

#### New `unihex` Glyph Provider

-   New glyph provider for reading Unifont HEX files
    -   HEX format describes font glyphs using a bitmap
        -   The height of every glyph is 16 pixels
        -   The width of glyph can be 8, 16, 24 or 32 pixels
    -   Every line is made of two hexadecimal numbers separated by `:`
    -   The first value describes a codepoint - it must have 4, 5 or 6 hex digits
    -   The second value describes the glyph as a stream of bits, line by line
-   When rendering, empty columns on left and right side of glyphs are removed
    -   Custom glyph widths can be set with `size_overrides`
-   This provider requires two fields:
    -   `hex_file` - path to ZIP archive containing one or more `*.hex` files (files in archive with different extensions are ignored)
    -   `size_overrides` - list of codepoint ranges that should have width different from auto-detected (based on empty space in glyph). Fields:
        -   `from`, `to` - start and end of codepoint range (inclusive)
        -   `left`, `right` - integers describing the position of the left-most and right-most columns of the glyph in range
            -   Any bits in columns outside of this range will be discarded

#### New `reference` Glyph Provider

-   New glyph provider that can be used to include providers from other fonts
    -   Providers are guaranteed to be loaded only once, no matter how many times they are included
-   Provider has one field `id`, that describes another font to be included in the currently loaded one
    -   Inclusion is performed after all fonts are loaded, so it will include all providers for a given font defined in all datapacks

#### Removed `legacy_unicode` Glyph Provider

-   The `legacy_unicode` glyph provider has been removed
-   This functionality has been replaced by the `unihex` provider

### Quick Play

-   Added support for four new command line arguments that allow the game to be launched directly into a world
-   `quickPlayPath` takes a specified path for logging (relative to the run directory)
    -   If a path is provided the following will be logged upon joining a world:
        -   `type`: is either `singleplayer`, `multiplayer`, or `realms`
        -   `identifier`: represents the world you want to join
            -   For singleplayer, the folder name of the world
            -   For multiplayer, the IP address of the server
            -   For realms, the Realms ID
        -   `port`: represents the server port and is only logged for multiplayer
        -   `name`: The name of the world
        -   `gamemode`: The gamemode of the world
        -   `lastPlayedTime`: The time you joined the world
    -   Example:
        -   `--quickPlayPath "quickPlay/log.json"` will resolve into `.minecraft/quickPlay/log.json`
-   `quickPlaySingleplayer`, `quickPlayMultiplayer` and `quickPlayRealms` all take their respective `identifier`
    -   If one of these arguments is provided, the game will try to launch directly into the given world
    -   Examples:
        -   `--quickPlaySingleplayer "New World"`
        -   `--quickPlayMultiplayer "localhost:25565"`
        -   `--quickPlayRealms "1234"`

### Telemetry

#### All Events

-   Added new property: `launcher_name`
    -   This is set based on the `minecraft.launcher.brand` system property
    -   This will help us troubleshoot game launch related bugs more effectively, as we will be able to see whether the issue originated in the Minecraft launcher or a third-party program

#### Updated Required Events

-   `world_loaded`
    -   Added new property: `realms_map_content`
        -   When loading into a Realms Map Content world (Minigame), the `world_loaded` event will receive the name of that map
        -   This is to help us understand how Java Realms players interact with Java Realms adventure or minimap content

#### New Optional Events

-   `advancement_made`
    -   This event is triggered when a player completes an advancement, and allows us to see the advancement ID and the time when the advancement was completed
    -   This helps us as a studio understand player progress and limits, which informs our game design
-   `game_load_times`
    -   This event is triggered when the game client is loaded
    -   Includes the time it took for the client to load
    -   This is so that we can work on improving and reducing the time it takes to load the game client

### `server.properties`

-   File is now read in UTF-8 initially, with previous encoding (ISO 8859-1/Latin 1) as a fallback
-   File is now written with UTF-8 encoding

### Symbolic Link Validation

To improve safety, the game will now detect symbolic links used inside world directory. For a detailed explanation, check our [help article](https://aka.ms/MinecraftSymLinks).

-   If the target of a symbolic link is not on the user-configured allow-list, the game will not proceed with loading the world
    -   Note: the world directory itself can still be linked
-   The list of allowed symbolic link targets is stored in file `allowed_symlinks.txt` in the client or server top directory
-   The file consists of entries (one per line) with following formats allowed:
    -   Lines starting with `#` are comments and are ignored
    -   `[type]pattern`, where `type` can be `glob`, `regex` or `prefix`
        -   `prefix` matches start of path with given pattern (so for `/test` paths `/test`, `/test/` and `/test/foo.txt` would match)
        -   `regex` matches regular expression against whole path
        -   `glob` uses OS-specific path matching mechanism (for example `*.txt` would usually match files with `txt` extension)
        -   Note: paths will use OS-specific separators
    -   `pattern`, which uses default `prefix` type

## Fixed bugs in 1.20

### Commands

#### `clone`

The clone command now supports specifying the source and target dimensions.

New syntax:

`clone [from <sourceDimension>] <begin> <end> [to <targetDimension>] <destination> ...`

Parameters:

-   `sourceDimension`: id of dimension to clone from
-   `targetDimension`: id of dimension to clone to

#### `damage`

New command to apply damage to entities.

Syntax:

-   `damage <target> <amount> [<damageType>] [at <location>]`
-   `damage <target> <amount> [<damageType>] [by <entity>] [from <cause>]`

Parameters:

-   `target`: The entity to damage
-   `amount`: Amount of damage to inflict
-   `damageType`: The type of damage to inflict
    -   This determines how the damage affects the entity as well as which death message is displayed
-   `entity`: The entity inflicting the damage
-   `cause`: The cause of the damage, in the case of indirect damage
    -   Example: When shot by an Arrow, the `entity` is the Arrow projectile while `cause` might be a Skeleton
-   `location`: The location the damage originated at (when no entity caused the damage)
    -   For instance, `location` might represent the location of a Bed exploding in the Nether

#### `data`

New source available:

-   `string <entity|block|storage> [path] [start] [end]` - reads a value as text, resulting in a string value

New arguments:

-   `start`: Index of first character to include at the start of the string
-   `end`: Index of the first character to exclude at the end of the string

#### `effect`

-   `infinite` is now a valid option for effect durations
    -   Infinite effect durations show up as "∞" in the player inventory view

#### `execute`

##### `execute if|unless`

New conditions available for the `execute if|unless` sub-command:

-   `execute if|unless loaded <pos>` - checks if the position given is fully loaded (in regard to both blocks and entities)
-   `execute if|unless dimension <dimension>` - checks if the execution is in a matching dimension

Parameters:

-   `pos`: Block position to check
-   `dimension`: A dimension id

##### `execute on`

New `execute` sub-command for selecting entities based on relation to the current executing entity:

-   `execute on <relation>`

Relations:

-   `vehicle` - the entity that the executing entity is riding
-   `passengers` - all entities directly riding the executing entity (no sub-passengers)
-   `controller` - the entity that is controlling the executing entity (for example: first passenger in a boat)
-   `owner` - the owner of the executing entity, if it is a tameable animal (like cats, wolves or parrots)
-   `leasher` - the entity leading the executing entity with a leash (might be a leash knot in case of being attached to a fence)
-   `target` - the attack target for the executing entity
-   `attacker` - the last entity that damaged the executing entity in the previous 5 seconds
-   `origin`:
    -   shooter, if the executing entity is a projectile (like Arrow, Fireball, Trident, Firework, Thrown Potion, etc.)
    -   thrower, if the executing entity is an item
    -   source of effect, if the executing entity is an Area Effect Cloud
    -   igniter, if the executing entity is a Primed TNT
    -   summoner, if the executing entity is Evoker Fangs or a Vex

If the relation is not applicable to the executing entity or there are no entities matching it, the selector returns zero elements.

##### `execute positioned over`

New `execute` sub-command for finding positions on top of a heightmap. Changes the height of the execution position to be on top of the given heightmap.

Syntax:

-   `execute positioned over <heightmap>`

###### Heightmaps

A heightmap records the highest position in a column of blocks according to some criteria. Available options:

-   `world_surface`: Any non-air block
-   `motion_blocking`: Any motion blocking material (e.g. ignores flowers and grass)
-   `motion_blocking_no_leaves`: Any non-leaf motion blocking material
-   `ocean_floor`: Any non-fluid motion blocking material

##### `execute summon`

New `execute` sub-command for summoning a new entity and binding the context (`@s`) to it. Meant to simplify entity setup and reduce the need for raw NBT editing.

Syntax:

-   `execute summon <entity id>`

#### `fillbiome`

-   The amount of network data transmitted when using the `fillbiome` command has been optimized

### `title`

-   All time arguments to `title times` are now time durations and work with `t`, `s` and `d` suffixes

#### `weather`

-   The duration of the weather change now matches the game's regular weather cycle if not specified
-   The `duration` parameter is now a time duration in ticks and works with `t`, `s` and `d` suffixes
    -   To retain existing functionality, you need to add an `s` suffix to pre-existing commands

#### `ride`

New command to allow entities to start or stop riding other entities.

Syntax:

-   `ride <target> mount <vehicle>`
    -   Makes a single target mount a single vehicle
    -   The command will fail if:
        -   `vehicle` is a player
        -   `target` is already riding a vehicle
        -   `target` and `vehicle` are the same entity
        -   `vehicle` is already a passenger (direct or indirect) of `target`
-   `ride <target> dismount`
    -   Dismounts `target` from any vehicle it is riding
    -   Fails if `target` is not riding anything

### Damage Types

Damage Types are a new registry that can be extended through data packs. A Damage Type determines how damage is handled by the game. This includes which attributes the damage has as well as which death message is used when an entity dies due to that type of damage.

Example:

    {
      "exhaustion": 0.1,
      "message_id": "arrow",
      "scaling": "when_caused_by_living_non_player"
    }
    

Fields:

-   `message_id`: The message id used for deaths caused by this damage type
    -   Will be combined with other string fragments to form a translation key
-   `exhaustion`: The amount of hunger exhaustion caused by this damage type
-   `scaling`: Whether this damage type scales with difficulty levels. Possible values:
    -   `never`: Damage is always the same
    -   `always`: Damage always scales with difficulty
    -   `when_caused_by_living_non_player`: Damage scales with difficulty if it was caused by a living entity who is not a player
-   `effects`: Optional field controlling how damage manifests when inflicted on players. Possible values:
    -   `hurt` (default): the default hurt sound
    -   `thorns`: Thorns hurt sound
    -   `drowning`: Drowning sound
    -   `burning`: A single tick of burning sound
    -   `poking`: Berry bush poke sound
    -   `freezing`: Freeze tick sound
-   `death_message_type`: Optional field that controls if special death message variants are used. Possible values:
    -   `default` (default): No special death message logic is applied
    -   `fall_variants`: Show a variant of fall damage death instead of a regular death message, e.g. `death.fell.assist.item`
    -   `intentional_game_design`: Show the intentional game design message instead of a regular death message

Damage type tags control many aspects of how damage from different sources are interpreted.

### Predicates

#### Damage Type Predicates

The following fields have been removed from damage type predicates: `is_projectile`, `is_explosion`, `bypasses_armor`, `bypasses_invulnerability`, `bypasses_magic`, `is_fire`, `is_magic`, `is_lightning`.

A new `tags` array has been added, with the predicate matching if all entries match. Each entry has two fields:

-   `id`: The ID of a damage type tag
-   `expected`: Whether the damage is expected to have or not have the tag for the predicate to match

### Game Rules

-   Added `commandModificationBlockLimit`, controlling the maximum number of blocks changed in one execution of `clone`, `fill` and `fillbiome`
-   Added `doVinesSpread` game rule, determining if vines will spread to nearby blocks
    -   Defaults to `true`

### Text components

Added an optional `fallback` field to `translate` text components.

-   The new field is a string that will be used in place of translation if it is missing
-   If `fallback` is missing, the old behavior (i.e. using the key itself as the translation) is preserved

### Display entities

Three new entities have been added for flexible display of items, blocks and text

-   Those entities, similarily to `marker`, don't tick and have no collisions or physics
-   Models render at entity position, with normal rotation around X and Y axis (so it can be controlled by teleport commands), but also with additional arbitrary model transform

#### Common data types

Tag contents for display entities include some new data types with a complex structure. Any form can be used for modifying data, but only one form is used for saving.

##### Transformations

Arbitrary affine transform.

-   Matrix form: array of 16 numbers, describing row-major matrix
-   Decomposed form (used for saving): object with following fields:
    -   `translation` - 3d vector
    -   `left_rotation`, `right_rotation` - `rotation`
    -   `scale` - 3d vector
    -   Transforms are composed in order `translation`, `left_rotation`, `scale`, `right_rotation`

##### Rotations

-   Quaternion form (used for saving): array of 4 numbers, describing components (x, y, z, w)
-   Axis-angle form: object with following fields:
    -   `axis` - unit 3d vector
    -   `angle` - in radians

#### Interpolation

Some properties of display entities can be interpolated. That means that clients will see gradual changes over time instead of instantaneous jumps.

Display entities keep track of current and previous values of interpolated values:

-   All properties marked as "interpolated" are part of a single interpolation set
-   Any update to interpolated property will cause all values of interpolation set to be saved as "current"
    -   Data command executions that do not change value of property (even if it's present in NBT) do not count as updates
    -   Updates are synchronized to clients at most once per tick, so multiple updates within command will still count as a single update
-   The last values generated before an update are saved as "previous"
-   If interpolation is enabled, the entity will transition between "previous" and "current" values over `interpolation_duration` ticks
-   Interpolation can be started by writing to the `start_interpolation` field (this field is not normally present in NBT)
    -   The value in this field is a delay in ticks between client receiving the update and interpolation start
    -   A value of `0` ticks means that interpolation will start in next client tick after receiving the update
    -   Positive values increase this delay further
-   Interpolation will end (entity fully in "current" state) in `start_interpolation` + `interpolation_duration` ticks after receiving the update
-   The interpolation target can be updated without setting `start_interpolation`, but it will still behave as if it was started at the moment of the last update to `start_interpolation`
    -   That means that if the value is updated, but more than `interpolation_duration` ticks have passed since last `start_interpolation` update, the entity will immediately jump to new values

#### Common properties

All display entity types have the following fields:

-   `transformation` - the transformation applied to model (after normal entity orientation). Defaults to identity. Interpolated
-   `billboard` - option to control if entity should pivot to face player when rendered:
    -   `fixed` - no rotation (default)
    -   `vertical` - entity can pivot around its vertical axis
    -   `horizontal` - entity can pivot around its horizontal axis
    -   `center` - entity can pivot around its center point
-   `brightness` - if present, overrides light values used for rendering. Omitted by default (which means rendering uses values from entity position). Object has two fields:
    -   `sky` - value of skylight, 0..15
    -   `block` - value of block light, 0..15
-   `view_range` - maximum view range of this entity. Actual distance depends on client-side render distance and entity distance scalling. Default value 1.0 (roughly the same as fireball)
-   `shadow_radius` - size of shadow. Defaults to 0 (no shadow). Interpolated
-   `shadow_strength` - strength of the shadow. Controls the opacity of the shadow as a function of distance to block below. Defaults to 1. Interpolated
-   `width`, `height` - describe size of culling bounding box
    -   Bounding box spans vertically `y` to `y+height` and horizontally `width/2` in all directions from entity position
    -   If either field is set to `0`, culling is disabled
    -   Both default to `0`
-   `glow_color_override` - override glow border color. Defaults to `-1` (use team color). Alpha component is ignored

#### `item_display`

Displays a single item stack.

-   Stack can be changed with commands by setting slot `container.0`

Fields:

-   `item` - item stack to display. Same format as in inventory (example: `{id: "minecraft:dirt", Count: 1}`)
-   `item_display` - describes item model transform applied to item (as defined in `display` section in model JSON)
    -   Values: `none` (default), `thirdperson_lefthand`, `thirdperson_righthand`, `firstperson_lefthand`, `firstperson_righthand`, `head`, `gui`, `ground`, `fixed`

#### `block_display`

Displays a block state.

-   Does not display all block entities, even if they would normally be created on block placement (like chests)

Fields:

-   `block_state` - block state to display. Same format as item held by endermen (example `{Name:"minecraft:dirt"}`)

#### `text_display`

Displays a text component.

Fields:

-   `text` - text to display. Components are resolved with the context of the display entity
-   `line_width` - line width used to split lines (note: new lines can be also added with `\n` characters). Defaults to 200
-   `text_opacity` - opacity (alpha component) of rendered text. Defaults to 255. Interpolated
-   `background` - color of background. Includes alpha channel. Defaults to 0x40000000. Interpolated
-   `default_background` - if true, rendering uses default text background color (same as in chat). Defaults to false
-   `shadow` - whether the text should be displayed with a shadow. Defaults to false
-   `see_through` - whether the text should be visible through blocks. Defaults to false
-   `alignment` - how the text should be aligned
    -   Values: `center` (default), `left`, `right`

Note: text display backgrounds uses new shader types `rendertype_text_background` and `rendertype_text_background_see_through`.

### Interaction Entities

A new type of entity that records attacks ("left clicks") and interactions ("right clicks"). Interactions are invisible and of a custom size.

Fields:

-   `width`: Width of the entity's bounding box (default `1`)
-   `height`: Height of the entity's bounding box (default `1`)
-   `attack`: Records the last attack action on the entity
-   `interaction`: Records the last interaction action on the entity
-   `response`: Boolean specifying if interacting should trigger a response (arm swing, sound effects, etc - default `false`)

#### Action Format

When an action is stored, it always has two fields:

-   `player`: The UUID (in standard integer array format) of the player performing the action
-   `timestamp`: The timestamp of the game tick when the event happened (stored as a long)

#### Advancement Triggers

-   Interacting with an Interaction entity triggers `player_interacted_with_entity`
-   Attacking an Interaction entity triggers `player_hurt_entity`

#### `execute on` with Interactions

The Interaction entity targets the player who last interacted with it. That makes the following possible:

-   `execute on attacker`: execute as the last player who attacked the entity
-   `execute on target`: execute as the last player who interacted with the entity

### Tags

#### Block Behavior

-   Fire burns out faster in certain biomes, and this is now controlled by the `increased_fire_burnout` biome tag

#### Mob Spawning

-   The `only_allows_snow_and_gold_rabbits` biome tag has been renamed to `spawns_gold_rabbits` to match its behavior
-   White Rabbit variants are now controlled by the `spawns_white_rabbits` biome tag
-   Fox variants are now controlled by the `spawns_snow_foxes` biome tag

#### Mob Behavior

-   Snow Golems melting in warm biomes is now controlled by the `snow_golem_melts` biome tag
-   Only mobs in the `dismounts_underwater` entity tag will now force the rider to dismount when underwater

### Network Protocol

-   Clients now reset their Secure Chat session state when receiving the login packet

#### Packet bundles

-   Added new delimiter packet to clientbound game protocol
-   All packets between two delimiters are guaranteed to be processed within same tick
-   For security reasons this feature is not supported in the serverbound direction

### Paletted Permutations

-   `paletted_permutations` is a new type of atlas configuration source used to dynamically generate new textures in memory based on a set of color palettes
-   Color palettes allow you to swap out the colors of a texture without having to supply all files for the variants of a texture in a resource pack
-   This is useful for things like armor trims, where you want to be able to change the color of parts of the armor without having to create a new texture for each color
-   The `paletted_permutations` source has a set of required parameters:
    -   `textures` A list of namespaced locations of base textures
        -   These textures will be used to generate variants of them that have been modified by color palettes
    -   `palette_key` A namespaced location of a color palette key file
        -   A color palette key is used to define the set of key pixel colors we want to swap out with the color palettes defined below
    -   `permutations` A map of permutations from suffix to a namespaced location of a color palette file
        -   The suffix is appended at the beginning to the resource location of the output variant textures, with a `_` character separating the suffix and the base texture name
        -   The color palette is a texture file with a set of pixels that are used for replacing pixels that match the color palette key in each base texture
        -   The number of pixels in each color palette must be the same as that of the `palette_key` defined for this source
        -   Key matching is done by comparing the RGB values of each pixel in the `palette_key` to the RGB values of each pixel in the color palette
        -   The alpha channel is ignored for key matching, but in the resulting texture the alpha channel is multiplied with the color palette's alpha channel
        -   Pixels that do not match the `palette_key` are copied over to the resulting texture as-is
-   After defining a `paletted_permutations` source, you can then reference those namespaced output textures in other resources in your resource pack

For example, if you have the following `paletted_permutations` source:

    {
        "type": "paletted_permutations",
        "textures": [
            "minecraft:item/leather_helmet",
            "minecraft:item/leather_chestplate",
            "minecraft:item/leather_leggings",
            "minecraft:item/leather_boots"
        ],
        "palette_key": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/leather_armor_color_key",
        "permutations": {
            "red": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/red",
            "green": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/green",
            "blue": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/blue"
        }
    }
    

You can then reference the resulting textures in other resources like this:

    {
        "textures": {
            "layer0": "minecraft:item/leather_helmet_red",
            "layer1": "minecraft:item/leather_chestplate_green",
            "layer2": "minecraft:item/leather_boots_blue"
        }
    }
    

### Trim Patterns & Materials

-   Trim patterns and materials for armor are defined by the server through the `trim_pattern` and `trim_material` registry respectively
    -   As a result, new trim patterns and materials can be added via data packs
-   These are synchronized to clients when they join the server
    -   However, clients must have an accompanying resource pack to see those registered trim patterns and materials
    -   The paths to these textures are inferred based on the filename of the pattern json, and will try to find the textures within the same namespace as the trim pattern's `name` field
-   The following data is defined by a trim pattern:
    -   `asset_id` which is a namespaced id used to infer texture locations and localization
    -   `template_item` which is the id of the smithing template item used to apply the trim pattern
    -   `description` which is a text component used for displaying the pattern name of an armor trim when hovering an armor itemstack
-   The following data is defined by a trim material:
    -   `asset_name` which is a string used as a suffix for armor trim texture locations
    -   `ingredient` which is the id of the ingredient item used to apply the trim material
    -   `item_model_index` which is a float which defines the item model override each armor item model should target to change their visuals for this material
    -   `override_armor_materials` which is an optional map of armor material to overridden color palette
        -   Map key is the armor material that this trim material wants to override with a different color palette
        -   Map value is the name of the color palette that will be used when this trim material is applied to an armor piece with the corresponding armor material
    -   `description` which is a text component used for displaying the material name of an armor trim when hovering an armor item stack
        -   The style defined in this description is applied to the armor trim pattern `description` as well

## Experimental Features

The following changes only apply when one or more Experiments is turned on, either by activating the corresponding experimental data pack or by turning it on in the Experiments screen while creating the world.

-   Added Smithing Template items
-   Redesigned the Smithing Table
-   Changed how Netherite equipment is crafted
-   Added a new armor trimming system to visually customize your armor
-   Added Sniffer mob and Torchflowers
-   Added the Cherry Grove biome
-   Added Archaeology
-   Mob Heads can now be placed on top of Note Blocks without sneaking

### Smithing Templates

-   Smithing Tables have been redesigned into a workstation for physical equipment upgrades and modifications
-   Alongside slots for combining a piece of equipment and materials, there is now a required slot for an item type called Smithing Templates
-   Smithing Templates define what type of upgrade you will be making to equipment
    -   It specifies both what type of items you can upgrade, and which ingredients are valid to customize the upgrade
    -   There are currently two categories of Smithing Templates: Armor Trim and Netherite Upgrade
-   Smithing Templates are consumed when used to upgrade an item in the Smithing Table
-   You can craft a copy of a Smithing Template in the Crafting Table with 7 diamonds + 1 block of material that the template is made out of + 1 smithing template, which will output 2 of the same Smithing Template

### Netherite Equipment

-   Netherite equipment crafting now also requires a Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template
-   Netherite Upgrade Smithing Templates can be found randomly in all Bastion Remnant chests, and there is a guarantee of 2 in every Treasure Room Bastion Remnant
-   This change was made for a variety of reasons:
    -   Increase the time players utilize Diamond equipment before Netherite
    -   Make Netherite equipment a more significant achievement in the game's progression
    -   Adapt Netherite more naturally into the new Smithing Table crafting system

### Armor Trims

-   You can now visually customize your armor with a variety of unique trims at the Smithing Table
-   Armor trims are purely visual with no gameplay benefits, and can only be applied to Helmets, Chestplates, Leggings and Boots
    -   All trim patterns are visually the same on an armor's item icon, but the color will still change based on the trim material
    -   To check which trim pattern a piece of armor has, you can hover over it in the inventory
-   Armor Trim Smithing Templates can be found all throughout the world, and each of the following structures contain their own unique Smithing Template:
    -   Pillager Outpost: Sentry Armor Trim
    -   Desert Pyramid: Dune Armor Trim
    -   Shipwreck: Coast Armor Trim
    -   Jungle Temple: Wild Armor Trim
    -   Ocean Monument: Tide Armor Trim
    -   Ancient City: Ward Armor Trim
    -   Woodland Mansion: Vex Armor Trim
    -   Nether Fortress: Rib Armor Trim
    -   Bastion Remnant: Snout Armor Trim
    -   Stronghold: Eye Armor Trim
    -   End City: Spire Armor Trim
-   Smithing Templates are found in chests in their respective structure
    -   The Ocean Monument has no chests, Elder Guardians sometimes instead drop a Smithing Template upon death
-   Some Armor Trim Smithing Templates are rarer than others, so be on the lookout for them to impress your friends!
-   An armor trim has two properties: a pattern and a material
    -   The pattern is defined by the Smithing Template used to apply the trim, and represents the visual pattern of the trim
    -   The material is defined by what ingredient you used to apply the trim, and represents the color of the trim
-   The viable ingredients you can use to define the color of your armor trim are the following:
    -   Iron, Copper, Gold, Lapis, Emerald, Diamond, Netherite, Redstone, Amethyst, Quartz

### Sniffer

-   The Sniffer is the mob vote winner of Minecraft Live 2022
-   Sniffers cannot be tempted or tamed
-   Sniffers are passive, friendly mobs
-   Sniffers sniff the air and occasionally dig for seeds, which produces a Torchflower Seed
-   Sniffers can be bred by feeding them Torchflower Seeds
-   The Sniffer is currently only available as a Spawn Egg in the creative inventory

### Torchflowers

-   The Torchflower seed can be planted on farmland and grows into a flower
-   The seed can be used to breed two Sniffers
-   The full-grown flower can be harvested and replanted but can also be crafted into a dye

### Cherry Groves

-   Added a new Cherry Grove biome, with pretty cherry blossom trees
    -   The biome can be found in the mountains, in similar places as Meadows
-   Added a new Cherry wood set, with all the corresponding wooden things you can make from it
-   Cherry Leaves have pink particles falling underneath
-   Added a new Pink Petals block with lots of pink flowers on the ground
    -   Each pink petal block can contain up to 4 petals
    -   Using bone meal on it increases the number of petals
    -   Placing a petal on a block increases the number of petals
    -   Mining the block gives you the number of petals in the block

### Archaeology

#### The Brush

-   The brush is a craftable item you can use to brush things

#### Suspicious Sand

-   Can be found in Desert Temples and Desert Wells
-   This fragile block is hard to spot and easy to destroy, so be careful!
-   Brushing the Suspicious Sand with a Brush will extract objects that were buried long ago

#### Pottery Shards

-   Pottery Shards have pictures on them
-   They cannot be crafted and are only found by brushing Suspicious Sand

#### Decorated Pots

-   Crafting four Pottery Shards together will create a Decorated Pot with a picture on each side
-   Brick items can be used instead of Pottery Shards in the Decorated Pot recipe
    -   The sides that were made from Brick items will not have pictures
-   Smash a Decorated Pot with any block-breaking tool to break it apart and get the Pottery Shards back
    -   Hitting the pot with bare hands, silk touch tools, or any other item, will drop an intact pot instead
