# Minecraft 1.16 Pre-Release 1

It's time for 1.16 pre-releases!

Going forward you should mostly see bugs being fixed. Additionally, pre-releases doesn't necessarily tend to our usual cadence of releasing on Wednesdays, so keep an eye out!

## New Features in 1.16 Pre-release 1

-   Added new "Fabulous" graphics option - uses per-pixel blending layers for some transparent elements

## Changes in 1.16 Pre-release 1

-   You can now milk Cows and Mooshrooms in creative mode
-   You can now get stew from Mooshrooms in creative mode
-   When you use an empty bucket on water in creative mode, you now get a bucket of water. If you have a bucket of water in your inventory already, no additional water buckets will be added when you use your empty bucket on water.
-   When any villager is struck by lightning, the witch it is converted to will no longer despawn
-   Added gamerule universalAnger (disabled by default), which makes angered neutral mobs attack any nearby player, not just the player that angered them. Works best if you disable forgiveDeadPlayers.
-   Added gamerule forgiveDeadPlayers (enabled by default), which makes angered neutral mobs stop being angry when the targeted player dies nearby.
-   Zombified piglins no longer attack innocent bystanders (unless you enable gamerule universalAnger)
-   Zombified piglins stop being angry if the targeted player dies nearby (unless you disable gamerule forgiveDeadPlayers)

## Technical Changes in 1.16 Pre-release 1

-   Smithing recipes can now be added or changed through data packs
-   Game will now detect critical datapack issues, like missing required tags and prevent world from being loaded

### Data Pack Selection

-   Data packs can now be selected before world is created
-   "Copy world" option will also copy data packs present in source world

### Pack Selection Screen

-   Packs can now be dropped directly on data and resource pack selection screens
-   Dropped files and directories will be copied to appropriate places

### Smithing Recipes

There's now a `smithing` recipe type. Recipes of this type are used in the smithing table to upgrade one item type into another type, maintaining tags.

-   `base` - Ingredient specifying an item to be upgraded.
-   `addition` - Ingredient specifying valid items to trigger the upgrade.
-   `result` - Item specifying the resulting type of the upgraded item.

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w22a

It has been a busy week for us but we still wanted to squeeze out a snapshot as we've been busy squashing a bunch of bugs.

## Experimental Rendering Changes

We've included some experimental changes to graphics rendering in this snapshot, which might reveal some issues on a small number of older graphics cards.

If do you find any new graphical bugs then please report them to the bug tracker with the make and model of your graphics card as well as which operating system you are using â€‹

## New Features in 20w22a

â€‹

-   Piglins now sometimes dance in celebration of a completed hunt

â€‹

## Changes in 20w22a

â€‹

-   Villager workstation logic changes
-   Bells can be hung from the underside of more blocks
-   When a villager that was traded with is struck by lightning, the witch it is converted to will no longer despawn
-   Players can no longer mount another entity when the crouch key is held down

â€‹

### Villager Workstation Logic

â€‹

-   Villagers no longer try to work at the same workstation
-   The most experienced nearby villager for the profession corresponding to the workstation you add will get the workstation
-   Villagers now have to walk to and reach the workstation before they can acquire the profession / work there
-   Villagers can no longer claim workstations / professions during raids or night time.
-   Villagers will check and make sure their workstation is valid at all times of day as long as they are within 16 blocks of their workstation.

â€‹

## Technical Changes in 20w22a

â€‹

-   Slightly changed datapack loading to prevent custom datapacks from crashing
-   Cached repeated block type lookups and collisions during pathfinding for increased performance
-   Minor optimizations in collision detection
-   Top level element in predicate file can now be array (all contents will be ANDed)
-   Added shader support for accessing depth buffer.
-   Renderer now uses per-pixel blending layers for some transparent elements.

â€‹

### Datapack loading

â€‹

-   If datapack reload fails, changes will not be applied and game will continue using previous data
-   If existing datapacks prevent world from loading, game will give option to load world in safe mode, which loads only vanilla datapack
-   Changes to datapack list are stored only after successful reload
-   Added `--safeMode` option to server to load only with vanilla datapack
-   Game will now detect critical datapack issues, like missing required tags and prevent world from being loaded

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w21a

In this snapshot, we're adding support for custom world settings and custom dimensions. This is an early release to hear your feedback about this feature - do note that this support is considered experimental and unsupported. Any custom world settings may change from one snapshot to the next, and worlds using custom settings will be clearly marked as experimental in your worlds list. â€‹

## New Features in 20w21a

â€‹

-   Added the ability to toggle redstone wire between a cross and a dot
-   Added import/export world settings functionality
-   Added a new disableMultiplayer command line option - when used, the Multiplayer button is disabled
-   Added a new disableChat command line option - when used, receiving and sending online chat is disabled

â€‹

### Redstone Toggle

â€‹

-   When right clicking a single piece of redstone, it toggles between a the cross and the dot
-   A dot of redstone will not power its surrounding blocks

â€‹

## Changes in 20w21a

â€‹

-   Piglins no longer walk around when admiring gold
-   If you hurt a piglin while it is admiring an ingot, the ingot will now disappear
-   Increased the chance of ores to generate in the Basalt Deltas to balance against the reduced amount of Netherrack in this biome
-   Lily pads are now considered junk fishing loot rather than treasure
-   Updated logos for Mojang Studios and Minecraft
-   Temporarily removed structure settings from flat level preset strings (workaround: use import/export settings functionality)

â€‹

## Technical Changes in 20w21a

â€‹

-   Added the ability to control the height of the `spreadplayers` command
-   Added custom worlds and custom dimensions

â€‹

### Commands

â€‹

**`spreadplayers`**

â€‹ Added an optional argument to specify maximum height. New syntax: `spreadplayers <center> <spreadDistance> <maxRange> [under <maxHeight>] <respectTeams> <targets>` â€‹

-   `maxHeight` - Specifies the maximum height for resulting positions

â€‹

**`locate`**

â€‹

-   Structure names are now specified as lowercase

â€‹

### Custom Worlds

â€‹

-   Added experimental support for new custom worlds
-   Edit world screen now has an option to export world settings to a JSON file
-   During world creation you can import previously exported world settings
-   A bunch of new parameters are exposed, but marked as experimental, meaning you can play with them, but there is no guarantee that any of them will continue working (even in the next snapshot!)
-   Flat level preset string lost structure settings (they are now stored in a common format for all worlds), we will restore some form of this functionality soon
-   Buffet world can no longer be created from server.properties, flat level settings changed a bit; better support for custom world creation on the server is coming soon

**F3 + N (Toggle Spectator)**

A small change has been made to this debug combination. â€‹

-   By default, using this key would return to Creative after toggling from Spectator. It now will toggle back to the previous game mode you had.

-   Added `thrown_item_picked_up_by_entity` advancement trigger
-   Added `player_generates_container_loot` advancement trigger
-   Added `item_used_on_block` advancement trigger
