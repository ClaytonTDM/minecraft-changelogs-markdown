# Minecraft Snapshot 21w03a

Today's Caves & Cliffs snapshot is particularly shiny! You could almost say it's glowing... Oh wait, that's a squid.

## New Features in 21w03a

​

-   Added Glow Lichen!
-   Added the Glow Squid!

​

### Glow Lichen

-   A dim light source that generates in caves
-   Use shears to pick it up
-   Use bonemeal to spread it along block surfaces

​

### Glow Squid

Glow squids have been added, but do not yet spawn naturally. You can find spawn eggs for them in the creative inventory.

-   Glow Squids are well-lit and can be seen from even far distances!
-   When killed, Glow Squids drop Glow Ink Sacs
-   Glow Ink Sacs can be used on signs to make the text super visible, even at night! Works with colors!
-   Craft a Glow Item Frame by combining a Glow Ink Sac with an Item Frame in a Crafting Table. Any item in a Glow Item Frame is perfectly illuminated, even at night!
-   Use an Ink Sac on a sign to remove the glow effect
-   Axolotls will attack any Glow Squids they see, so...be careful

​

## Changes in 21w03a

​

-   Dripstone blocks can be crafted from 4 pointed dripstone

Ready your screenshot buttons and start rehearsing your best "naaaaww"s. The final snapshot of the year enters Minecraft Java, and what better way to end the year than with something that has been on our bucket list for quite a while: the adorable **axolotl**?

We hope you'll end the year on a good note, and the entirety of the Java team wishes you happy holidays.

## New Features in 20w51a

​

-   Added the axolotl!

​

### Axolotl

-   Amphibious!
-   Axolotls currently love tropical fish, though this may change. Tropical fish or tropical fish buckets can be used to mate axolotls
-   Axolotls will swim around with you if you're holding a tropical fish or tropical fish bucket in one of your hands
-   When a player kills a mob that the axolotl was attacking or being attacked by, the axolotl will show its appreciation by granting the player temporary regeneration and removing any mining fatigue effects
-   You can pick up your axolotl in a water bucket and carry it around just like a salmon or cod!
-   Axolotls will always chase after squids and other types of fish
-   Axolotls are skittish, but they will attack Drowned and Guardians if you tempt them with their favorite food - tropical fish!
-   Axolotls do not like it out of water, and will dry up and begin taking damage if they are out of water for longer than 5 minutes
-   An axolotl will not dry up as long as they are in water or rain
-   Sometimes when an axolotl takes damage, it will pretend to be dead so that it stops being attacked
-   There are 4 common varieties and 1 rare variety of axolotl
-   Axolotls do not spawn in the world yet, but you can find spawn eggs for them in the creative inventory

​

## Changes in 20w51a

-   Bundles and shulker box items will now drop their items when destroyed
-   Some changes have been made to Sculk Sensors

​

### Sculk Sensors

-   Eating Start has been removed as an event for a few reasons.
    -   It is inconsistent with our philosophy around vibrations. Mining a block is not considered a vibration because a physical event hasn't happened in the world yet (you can stop mining and the block will revert). This is the same for eating: you can start eating, but then stop and the food reverts as if eating never occurred.
    -   It wasn't widely considered to be a useful event for players to use Sculk Sensors with.
    -   Eating Finish is staying, and will likely be much more useful to Sculk Sensors for this scenario.
-   Walking on wool no longer causes vibrations.
-   Throwing wool as an item onto the ground no longer causes vibrations.
-   Sculk Sensors are now silent while waterlogged.

​

#### Vibration Frequency Changes

As we continue to consider feedback from the community, some changes to the frequency ranges have been made. We expect this to change quite heavily up until release to figure out the most interesting ranges for gameplay, and as always feedback is extremely welcome!

Another snapshot is going out, and this one introduces the Sculk. They're a bit creepy, but don't let that put you off. Pick up some good vibrations!

## New Features in 20w49a

-   Added Dripstone Caves biome
-   Added Sculk Sensors

### Dripstone Caves biome

This biome doesn't generate naturally yet, since it is designed for the upcoming larger caves. However, if you want to see the biome in the current caves you can create a single-biome world with dripstone caves.

-   Contains plenty of Pointed Dripstone on the floors and ceilings, and small pools of water
-   In some places you'll find larger stalagmites, stalactites, and columns built from Dripstone Blocks.

### Sculk Sensors

-   Introducing the bizarre, tendril-filled world of Sculk - prepare for Sculk Sensors to creep you out with their unique ability to detect vibrations nearby.
-   A vibration is anything that causes physical motion; if you are careful, there are some motions that are undetectable to sensors by sneaking.
    -   These sneak-friendly vibrations currently include walking, falling to the ground or throwing/shooting projectiles.
-   Sculk Sensors will not listen to vibrations that are directly created by other Sculk sources.
-   When a vibration is detected, a signal is sent from the source location to the sensor at a speed of 1 game tick per block.
    -   Other vibrations cannot be detected by a sensor when a signal is already travelling to it.
    -   When the signal has arrived, the sensor will be activated for 40 game ticks (approximately 2 seconds).
    -   While activated, the sensor cannot detect other vibrations.
-   Sculk Sensors can detect vibrations in an 8 block radius around it.
-   The efficient tool to mine Sculk Sensors is the Hoe.
-   They can be waterlogged.

#### Redstone Emission

-   Sculk Sensors emit a redstone signal when they are activated.
-   The strength of the redstone signal is inversely proportional to the distance the vibration signal travelled.
    -   This means that the closer the vibration is, the stronger the redstone signal is.
    -   The output is also scaled based on the Sculk Sensor's radius, so it can reach the max redstone signal strength when the vibration is 0 distance away (directly on top of the sensor).

#### Vibration Frequencies

-   Sculk Sensors have a unique interaction with comparators.
-   Each vibration in the game falls under a certain frequency value, and this value can be measured with a comparator.
-   With the right contraption, this allows you to detect when a certain action has occured nearby.

#### Wool Occlusion

-   Wool has a special interaction with Sculk Sensors.
-   If a wool block is in the way of a vibration source, the sensor will not be able to detect it.

#### Technical Tidbits

-   Sculk Sensors have a cooldown period of 1 tick after being placed or after deactivating.
-   During this short cooldown period, it cannot detect vibrations. This is to prevent it from activating itself when a contraption it is powering is being unpowered. Feedback is welcome on this point!

## Changes in 20w49a

-   The Fullness of a bundle now shows up regardless of whether Advanced Tooltips are on or off
-   Stalactites and stalagmites merge if the tips are next to each other, unless you press shift while placing

## Technical Changes in 20w49a

-   A new game event system has been implemented to support Sculk Sensors detecting vibrations.
-   World height related values are now exposed for customized worlds
-   Removed the `max-build-height` server setting
-   Added `occludes_vibration_signals` block tag. Anything in this tag will occlude vibrations, and inherits `wool` tag entries by default
-   New particle types: `vibration` and `dust_color_transition`
-   A new game event system has been implemented to support Sculk Sensors detecting vibrations.

### Game Events

This system has been developed to identify when certain in-world actions are happening in nearby chunks, particularly so the new Sculk Sensor can detect these events as vibrations.

The following is a list of the initial game events:

-   `minecraft:step`
-   `minecraft:swim`
-   `minecraft:flap`
-   `minecraft:elytra_free_fall`
-   `minecraft:hit_ground`
-   `minecraft:splash`
-   `minecraft:projectile_shoot`
-   `minecraft:projectile_land`
-   `minecraft:entity_hit`
-   `minecraft:block_place`
-   `minecraft:block_destroy`
-   `minecraft:fluid_place`
-   `minecraft:fluid_pickup`
-   `minecraft:block_open`
-   `minecraft:block_close`
-   `minecraft:block_switch`
-   `minecraft:block_unswitch`
-   `minecraft:block_attach`
-   `minecraft:block_detach`
-   `minecraft:block_press`
-   `minecraft:block_unpress`
-   `minecraft:container_open`
-   `minecraft:container_close`
-   `minecraft:explode`
-   `minecraft:armor_stand_add_item`
-   `minecraft:wolf_shaking`
-   `minecraft:dispense_fail`
-   `minecraft:fishing_rod_cast`
-   `minecraft:fishing_rod_reel_in`
-   `minecraft:piston_extend`
-   `minecraft:piston_contract`
-   `minecraft:flint_and_steel_use`
-   `minecraft:eating_start`
-   `minecraft:eating_finish`
-   `minecraft:lightning_strike`

#### Tags

There are also game event tags that come with this, and can be modified by data packs. They can be found under `data/minecraft/tags/game_events`.

-   `vibrations` Determines which game events are considered vibrations by the Sculk Sensor. Currently, all added game events are in this tag by default.
-   `ignore_vibrations_stepping_carefully` Which game events should be ignored by the Sculk Sensor when the source of the event is sneaking.

The following game events are in `ignore_vibrations_stepping_carefully` by default:

-   `minecraft:step`
-   `minecraft:hit_ground`
-   `minecraft:projectile_shoot`
