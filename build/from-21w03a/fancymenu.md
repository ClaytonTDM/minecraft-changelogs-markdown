# Minecraft Snapshot 21w03a

Today's Caves & Cliffs snapshot is particularly shiny! You could almost say it's glowing... Oh wait, that's a squid.

## New Features in 21w03a

​

-   Added Glow Lichen!
-   Added the Glow Squid!

​

### Glow Lichen

-   A dim light source that generates in caves
-   Use shears to pick it up
-   Use bonemeal to spread it along block surfaces

​

### Glow Squid

Glow squids have been added, but do not yet spawn naturally. You can find spawn eggs for them in the creative inventory.

-   Glow Squids are well-lit and can be seen from even far distances!
-   When killed, Glow Squids drop Glow Ink Sacs
-   Glow Ink Sacs can be used on signs to make the text super visible, even at night! Works with colors!
-   Craft a Glow Item Frame by combining a Glow Ink Sac with an Item Frame in a Crafting Table. Any item in a Glow Item Frame is perfectly illuminated, even at night!
-   Use an Ink Sac on a sign to remove the glow effect
-   Axolotls will attack any Glow Squids they see, so...be careful

​

## Changes in 21w03a

​

-   Dripstone blocks can be crafted from 4 pointed dripstone

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w51a

Ready your screenshot buttons and start rehearsing your best "naaaaww"s. The final snapshot of the year enters Minecraft Java, and what better way to end the year than with something that has been on our bucket list for quite a while: the adorable **axolotl**?

We hope you'll end the year on a good note, and the entirety of the Java team wishes you happy holidays.

## New Features in 20w51a

​

-   Added the axolotl!

​

### Axolotl

-   Amphibious!
-   Axolotls currently love tropical fish, though this may change. Tropical fish or tropical fish buckets can be used to mate axolotls
-   Axolotls will swim around with you if you're holding a tropical fish or tropical fish bucket in one of your hands
-   When a player kills a mob that the axolotl was attacking or being attacked by, the axolotl will show its appreciation by granting the player temporary regeneration and removing any mining fatigue effects
-   You can pick up your axolotl in a water bucket and carry it around just like a salmon or cod!
-   Axolotls will always chase after squids and other types of fish
-   Axolotls are skittish, but they will attack Drowned and Guardians if you tempt them with their favorite food - tropical fish!
-   Axolotls do not like it out of water, and will dry up and begin taking damage if they are out of water for longer than 5 minutes
-   An axolotl will not dry up as long as they are in water or rain
-   Sometimes when an axolotl takes damage, it will pretend to be dead so that it stops being attacked
-   There are 4 common varieties and 1 rare variety of axolotl
-   Axolotls do not spawn in the world yet, but you can find spawn eggs for them in the creative inventory

​

## Changes in 20w51a

-   Bundles and shulker box items will now drop their items when destroyed
-   Some changes have been made to Sculk Sensors

​

### Sculk Sensors

-   Eating Start has been removed as an event for a few reasons.
    -   It is inconsistent with our philosophy around vibrations. Mining a block is not considered a vibration because a physical event hasn't happened in the world yet (you can stop mining and the block will revert). This is the same for eating: you can start eating, but then stop and the food reverts as if eating never occurred.
    -   It wasn't widely considered to be a useful event for players to use Sculk Sensors with.
    -   Eating Finish is staying, and will likely be much more useful to Sculk Sensors for this scenario.
-   Walking on wool no longer causes vibrations.
-   Throwing wool as an item onto the ground no longer causes vibrations.
-   Sculk Sensors are now silent while waterlogged.

​

**Vibration Frequency Changes**

As we continue to consider feedback from the community, some changes to the frequency ranges have been made. We expect this to change quite heavily up until release to figure out the most interesting ranges for gameplay, and as always feedback is extremely welcome! Here is the newest table in this snapshot.

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w49a

Another snapshot is going out, and this one introduces the Sculk. They're a bit creepy, but don't let that put you off. Pick up some good vibrations!

## New Features in 20w49a

-   Added Dripstone Caves biome
-   Added Sculk Sensors

### Dripstone Caves biome

This biome doesn't generate naturally yet, since it is designed for the upcoming larger caves. However, if you want to see the biome in the current caves you can create a single-biome world with dripstone caves.

-   Contains plenty of Pointed Dripstone on the floors and ceilings, and small pools of water
-   In some places you'll find larger stalagmites, stalactites, and columns built from Dripstone Blocks.

### Sculk Sensors

-   Introducing the bizarre, tendril-filled world of Sculk - prepare for Sculk Sensors to creep you out with their unique ability to detect vibrations nearby.
-   A vibration is anything that causes physical motion; if you are careful, there are some motions that are undetectable to sensors by sneaking.
    -   These sneak-friendly vibrations currently include walking, falling to the ground or throwing/shooting projectiles.
-   Sculk Sensors will not listen to vibrations that are directly created by other Sculk sources.
-   When a vibration is detected, a signal is sent from the source location to the sensor at a speed of 1 game tick per block.
    -   Other vibrations cannot be detected by a sensor when a signal is already travelling to it.
    -   When the signal has arrived, the sensor will be activated for 40 game ticks (approximately 2 seconds).
    -   While activated, the sensor cannot detect other vibrations.
-   Sculk Sensors can detect vibrations in an 8 block radius around it.
-   The efficient tool to mine Sculk Sensors is the Hoe.
-   They can be waterlogged.

**Redstone Emission**

-   Sculk Sensors emit a redstone signal when they are activated.
-   The strength of the redstone signal is inversely proportional to the distance the vibration signal travelled.
    -   This means that the closer the vibration is, the stronger the redstone signal is.
    -   The output is also scaled based on the Sculk Sensor's radius, so it can reach the max redstone signal strength when the vibration is 0 distance away (directly on top of the sensor).

**Vibration Frequencies**

-   Sculk Sensors have a unique interaction with comparators.
-   Each vibration in the game falls under a certain frequency value, and this value can be measured with a comparator.
-   With the right contraption, this allows you to detect when a certain action has occured nearby.

**Wool Occlusion**

-   Wool has a special interaction with Sculk Sensors.
-   If a wool block is in the way of a vibration source, the sensor will not be able to detect it.

**Technical Tidbits**

-   Sculk Sensors have a cooldown period of 1 tick after being placed or after deactivating.
-   During this short cooldown period, it cannot detect vibrations. This is to prevent it from activating itself when a contraption it is powering is being unpowered. Feedback is welcome on this point!

## Changes in 20w49a

-   The Fullness of a bundle now shows up regardless of whether Advanced Tooltips are on or off
-   Stalactites and stalagmites merge if the tips are next to each other, unless you press shift while placing

## Technical Changes in 20w49a

-   A new game event system has been implemented to support Sculk Sensors detecting vibrations.
-   World height related values are now exposed for customized worlds
-   Removed the `max-build-height` server setting
-   Added `occludes_vibration_signals` block tag. Anything in this tag will occlude vibrations, and inherits `wool` tag entries by default
-   New particle types: `vibration` and `dust_color_transition`
-   A new game event system has been implemented to support Sculk Sensors detecting vibrations.

### Game Events

This system has been developed to identify when certain in-world actions are happening in nearby chunks, particularly so the new Sculk Sensor can detect these events as vibrations.

The following is a list of the initial game events:

-   `minecraft:step`
-   `minecraft:swim`
-   `minecraft:flap`
-   `minecraft:elytra_free_fall`
-   `minecraft:hit_ground`
-   `minecraft:splash`
-   `minecraft:projectile_shoot`
-   `minecraft:projectile_land`
-   `minecraft:entity_hit`
-   `minecraft:block_place`
-   `minecraft:block_destroy`
-   `minecraft:fluid_place`
-   `minecraft:fluid_pickup`
-   `minecraft:block_open`
-   `minecraft:block_close`
-   `minecraft:block_switch`
-   `minecraft:block_unswitch`
-   `minecraft:block_attach`
-   `minecraft:block_detach`
-   `minecraft:block_press`
-   `minecraft:block_unpress`
-   `minecraft:container_open`
-   `minecraft:container_close`
-   `minecraft:explode`
-   `minecraft:armor_stand_add_item`
-   `minecraft:wolf_shaking`
-   `minecraft:dispense_fail`
-   `minecraft:fishing_rod_cast`
-   `minecraft:fishing_rod_reel_in`
-   `minecraft:piston_extend`
-   `minecraft:piston_contract`
-   `minecraft:flint_and_steel_use`
-   `minecraft:eating_start`
-   `minecraft:eating_finish`
-   `minecraft:lightning_strike`

**Tags**

There are also game event tags that come with this, and can be modified by data packs. They can be found under `data/minecraft/tags/game_events`.

-   `vibrations` Determines which game events are considered vibrations by the Sculk Sensor. Currently, all added game events are in this tag by default.
-   `ignore_vibrations_stepping_carefully` Which game events should be ignored by the Sculk Sensor when the source of the event is sneaking.

The following game events are in `ignore_vibrations_stepping_carefully` by default:

-   `minecraft:step`
-   `minecraft:hit_ground`
-   `minecraft:projectile_shoot`

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w46a

The snow is snowier than before.

For today’s snapshot, we’ve changed most of the textures introduced in the previous snapshot. This is simply to test if these textures give a better experience in exploring and building. We’re interested to hear what you think. Keep in mind, that some textures might be reverted or changed again in the future

## New Features in 20w46a

-   Added Powder Snow!

### Powder Snow

Snowier snow!

-   Powder Snow is a trap block that causes any entity that walks into it to sink in it
-   You can pick up and place Powder Snow with a bucket
-   Wear leather boots to prevent yourself from sinking into Powder Snow blocks
-   Leave a Cauldron outside in falling snow and it will fill with Powder Snow

**Freezing**

-   Standing in Powder Snow will slowly freeze an entity
-   Once frozen, freeze damage is done every few seconds to the frozen entity
-   Each piece of leather armor warn causes an entity to freeze more slowly
-   Wearing a full set of leather armor prevents freezing entirely

## Changes in 20w46a

-   The range in which a lightning rod attracts lightning has been doubled
-   Copper blocks are now crafted from 4 copper ingots
-   Sky color now varies smoothly when moving between different biomes
-   Buttons that change value (like `Difficulty`) can now be controlled with mouse wheel
-   Clicking on button that changes value while holding shift key changes to previous value
-   "Debug" world type can now be accessed while holding alt key (was shift)

### Textures

Changed a number of the textures for blocks and items introduced in the previous snapshot:

-   Cut Copper
-   Lightning Rod
-   Calcite
-   Amethyst Block
-   Budding Amethyst Block
-   Tinted Glass
-   Candle Item Icons
-   Copper Ingot Item Icon
-   Amethyst Shard Item Icon
-   Bundle Item Icon

## Technical Changes in 20w46a

-   Removed `/replaceitem` command
-   Added `/item` command
-   Added item modifiers, which reuse loot table functions syntax to describe item modification in `/item` command.
-   Data pack version is now 7
-   Loot tables can now access scoreboard values by UUID.
-   Loot table values inside random number generators can now be nested.
-   Default mode of structure blocks is now `Load`. `Data` is now hidden (but can be accessed by clicking mode button while holding alt key)

### Item modifiers

The function part of loot tables can now be defined as separate data pack resource in `item_modifiers` directory. Such files can contain a single function (i.e single JSON object) or an array of functions.

### Commands

**`item`**

Modifies item or block inventory.

This command has three forms:

-   `/item <target> replace <item stack> [<count>]` - same as old `replaceitem`
-   `/item <target> modify <modifier>` - modifies item (without copying).
-   `/item <target> copy <source> [<modifier>]` - copies item for source to target(s), optionally applying modifier

Possible sources and targets:

-   `entity <selector> <slot>`
-   `block <x> <y> <z> <slot>`

For example, `/item block ~ ~ ~ container.0 copy entity @s enderchest.0` will copy first item from player's enderchest to first slot of container player is currently standing on.

### Loot tables

**New conditions**

**`value_check`**

Checks range of value.

Parameters:

-   `value` - see "New value providers" section (currently combination of random generators and score)
-   `range` - min/max range

**Changed conditions**

**`score`**

`entity` parameter has now been replaced with `target`. It can either contain value from old `entity` field (like `this`) or be an score holder name in form `{"name": "..."}`.

**Changed functions**

**`set_damage`**

This function now has `add` parameter. If `true`, change will be relative to current damage. If `false`, damage will be replaced with current value (default behavior)

**`set_count`**

This function now has `add` parameter. If `true`, change will be relative to current item count. If `false`, item count will be replaced with current value (default behavior)

**`copy_nbt`**

`source` parameter can now be set to `{"storage": <namespaced id>}`, to access command storage.

**New functions**

**`set_enchantments`**

Modifies enchantments on item

**Parameters**

-   `enchantments` - map of enchantment id to level value (can be score or random number)
-   `add` - if `true`, change will be relative to current level. If `false`, level will be replaced with current value (default behavior)

**New value providers**

Note: value providers can be used in same places as random number generators.

**`score`**

Returns scaled scoreboard value.

**Parameters**

-   `score` - scoreboard name
-   `target` - same as `target` in `score` predicate
-   `scale` - scaling factor (float)

### Data Packs

Changes to data packs for version 7:

-   Removal of `/replaceitem` (replaced with `/item replace`)
-   `score` loot table condition: `entity` parameter has been replaced with `target`

## Resource Packs

Changes to resource packs for version 7:

-   Drowned texture mirroring has changed (see MC-174685)
-   slots for the game mode selector are now 26 pixels instead of 25
