# Minecraft Snapshot 25w34a

This week it's time for a smaller snapshot with a new main menu panorama, code of conducts for servers and much tinkering and fixing with our new friends, the Copper Golems. Happy mining!

> **Developer's Note**: _The rendering changes introduced in 25w31a for entities are now expanded to affect block entities and items. Please report any issues you encounter in these areas._

## New Features

-   Servers can now have an in-game Code of Conduct

### Server Code of Conduct

When connecting to a server, a Code of Conduct screen can now be shown.

-   Accepting the Code of Conduct is required to play on the server
-   A checkbox is available for not showing the same Code of Conduct in the future
    -   If the Code of Conduct changes, it will be shown again

#### Server Setup

-   A new boolean field has been added to `server.properties` called `enable-code-of-conduct`
    -   Setting it to `true` will make the server look for code of conduct files in the `codeofconduct` subfolder in the same folder as `server.properties`
    -   Each file in the folder should have the form `<language_code>.txt`
        -   The language shown will attempt to match the player's language
        -   If it doesn't exist, the `en_us` code of conduct will be used
        -   If that also doesn't exist, an arbitrary available entry is used

## Changes

-   The main menu now has an updated background panorama showing Copper Golems in a Village

### The End Light Flashes

-   The sound effect produced by a flash now has a higher delay
-   The "Hide Lightning Flashes" accessibility setting has been renamed to "Hide Sky Flashes" and now also disables the End Flashes
    -   When the flash is disabled by the setting the world will not be lit by the flash, but the flash source will still be visible in the sky and the sound effect will still play

### Minor Tweaks to Blocks, Items and Entities

-   The eyes of the Copper Golem are now invisible as well when splashed with Potion of Invisibility
-   Copper Golems hitbox has been tweaked
    -   The hitbox is now 0.6 blocks in width to be able to pathfind through open doors
    -   The hitbox is now 1.01 blocks in height to not get stuck in certain blocks

### Sounds

-   Copper Golem & Copper Chests are now audible from up to 12 blocks away
-   The copper sorting sounds have been tweaked to be quieter

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 84.0
-   The Resource Pack version is now 66.0

## Data Pack Version 84.0

-   Player profiles in data components and block entities no longer resolve automatically
-   Added `fetchprofile` command for downloading player profiles

### Block States

-   Removed `align_items_to_bottom` block state property from Shelf block
    -   It has been replaced with an equally named boolean field on the Shelf block entity
    -   Shelves created with this property set in the last snapshot will reset back to the default value (`false`)

### Commands

#### Added `fetchprofile`

-   New command that has been added to fetch the contents of a player profile from Minecraft servers
-   Since the operation might take some time, it works asynchronously
    -   Results will be printed only when operation finishes, but the game will keep running unpaused
-   After successful completion, a message will be printed that lets users copy the contents of a fully resolved `minecraft:profile` component or `/give @s minecraft:player_head` with said component
-   Since the result is not known at the time of execution, this command always returns `1`

Syntax:

-   `fetchprofile name <player name>` - resolves profile by name (case-insensitive)
-   `fetchprofile id <uuid>` - resolves profile by id

### Data Components

#### Modified `minecraft:profile`

-   Previously contents of this component would permanently change when profile was resolved, i.e. downloaded from Minecraft service
-   To avoid issues with this unexpected change, the resolved value is no longer stored and contents of the profile will always remain unchanged
-   That means this component has now two behaviors:
    -   Static: when it has `properties` field or when both `name` and `id` are present or when both are missing
        -   In this state, profile will always render as-is
        -   If `properties` field is missing, a default skin will be used (selected based on `id`, same as in offline mode)
        -   That means skin will be frozen at the moment of component creation
        -   This option is preferred for decorational uses
    -   Dynamic: when it has either `name` or `id` (but not both)
        -   When an item containing this profile is rendered on the client side, the profile will be resolved to most recent value
        -   This means that this item will always render with current skin of targeted player
            -   Note: if a player changes skin while game is running, change will not be visible unless clients restart
        -   Resolution might happen with a delay, during which item will render with a default skin
        -   Profile name will replace item name only when it's present
            -   Items with just `id` will show default name
        -   Items will dynamic profiles be distinguished from static ones with label in tooltip
-   Items stack based on exact contents, so even if a dynamic component is eventually resolved to the same profile as a static one, they won't stack together
-   Player heads in older maps that have not been loaded in never versions yet will usually be converted to dynamic contents

### Block Entity Data

#### Modified `minecraft:skull`

-   `profile` field has been changed to match `minecraft:profile` component
    -   That means that it also becomes immutable and is resolved only when necessary

### Text components

-   Bold and italics styles are ignored when drawing sprites

## Resource Pack Version 66.0

-   Removed block state `align_items_to_bottom` from the Shelf block
    -   See above for details

In this week's snapshot we've got a nice quality of life improvement for all the chatters out there. Now your unsent messages will be saved as drafts, check out the details below. Items on shelves will now be positioned in the middle of the shelf as default. Before we move our focus onto technical tweaks and bug fixes for this drop, we have one final feature to announce – and it involves a very cute interaction between the copper golem and the iron golem! With this, all features for our third game drop of 2025 are now in testing, and we'll start working our next game drop, which we are excited to tell you about soon!

## New Features

-   Added light flashes to The End dimension as part of the ongoing Vibrant Visuals work
-   Iron Golems will sometimes plant a decorative flower onto a nearby Copper Golem
-   Unsent chat messages now get saved as chat drafts

### The End Light Flashes

-   The End dimension now has skylight
-   Normally the skylight does not affect how the dimension looks
-   From time to time flashes in the sky happen
-   When they happen skylight intensity increases flooding the dimension with purple light

### Copper Golem

-   Iron Golems will sometimes plant a decorative flower onto a nearby Copper Golem
    -   The flower can be removed with Shears
    -   This flower is dropped when the Copper Golem turns into a Copper Golem Statue Block

### Chat Drafts

-   Unsent chat messages now get saved as chat drafts if the chat was forcibly closed
    -   This includes it being closed by external sources such as dying or a dialog opening, but not the player intentionally closing their chat
-   Any existing chat draft will get pre-filled into the message box the next time the chat is opened
-   Draft text has a grayed-out appearance until fully restored
    -   Draft text can be restored as regular text by interacting with it:
        -   Typing additional text
        -   Moving the text cursor using the arrow keys
        -   Clicking it
        -   Highlighting it
    -   Pressing enter on a chat draft prior to it being restored sends it like a normal chat message
    -   Pressing backspace on a chat draft prior to it being restored deletes it
-   Added an option to the Chat Settings menu that enables saving unsent chat messages by default
    -   With this option enabled, unsent messages will _always_ get saved as chat drafts, even if the player intentionally closed their chat

## Changes

-   Players seen in the game world of the current server are now always shown in the Social Interactions screen even if they are offline

### Blocks

#### Shelf

-   Items in the Shelf will render in the middle of the Shelf
-   Updated the sizes of many items in the Shelf to better fit the Shelf

> **Developer's Note:** _Thank you for all your valuable feedback on the shelf! Seeing the many creative ways you've been using this new block, we've decided to revert the change from last week that positioned items at the bottom of the shelf, as we agree that having the items centered provides more creative opportunities when building._

### UI

#### Chat

-   It is now possible to start chatting while standing inside a Nether Portal
-   The chat will now remain open and unchanged if the player was chatting before being transferred to another dimension

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 83.1
-   The Resource Pack version is now 65.2
-   Added new display transform "on\_shelf"
    -   Used for displaying items on the Shelf

## Data Pack Version 83.1

### Block States

-   Added `align_items_to_bottom` block state property to the Shelf block
    -   If `false` the items on the Shelf will ignore the vertical translation of the `on_shelf` item display transform and will be rendered vertically aligned to the middle of the Shelf
    -   If `true` the items on the Shelf will be rendered upward from the bottom of the Shelf and will respect the vertical translation of the `on_shelf` item display transform
    -   Default is `false` (items are aligned to the middle of the Shelf)

### Attributes

#### `run_command` Click Event

-   Previously, if the `command` field contained a command that required a signed message (`/say`, `/me`, `/msg`, `/tell`, `/w`, `/teammsg`, `/tm`), it would be silently discarded
-   Instead, a screen will be shown that lets the user insert the command into the chat window or copy the command to their clipboard if the chat window can't be opened

### Enchantments

#### `explode` Effects

New field: `block_effects` - specifies per-block particles. Each block particle is randomly chosen according to weights. A set limit of block particles is spawned each tick from all explosions that tick.

Format: List of entries:

-   `weight`: Non-negative integer representing the random weight for this entry being chosen
-   `particle`: The particle to spawn
-   `scaling`: Optional scaling to apply between explosion center and block position, or `1.0` if not specified
-   `speed`: Optional scaling to apply to the speed of the particle, or `1.0` if not specified

### Tags

#### Item Tags

-   Added `#shearable_from_copper_golem` - all items that can be removed from the Copper Golem's head slot via Shears

## Resource Pack Version 65.2

### Textures

-   Added a new texture:
    -   `environment/end_flash.png`

### Sounds

#### Sound Events

-   Added new sound event:
    -   `weather.end_flash`

Another Tuesday, another Snapshot release! Alongside technical updates and bug fixes, this week we're introducing a copper-y collection of goodies from our third game drop of the year: Build with copper torches, lanterns, chains, and bars – and watch them develop that stunning signature patina. With this week's release, you'll also find that items displayed in shelves have learned the noble art of sitting down.

Happy mining!

Oh, how we have yearned for the shipping room! We're back with our first snapshot release of the season, bringing you a big bundle of features from our third game drop of the year. Test the copper golem and copper chest for a tidier, livelier base, and watch your helper oxidize and turn into a statue, complete with adorable, redstone signal-emitting poses. Build functional decor using the brand-new shelves and try out copper weapons, tools and armor. To top it off, this release also includes copper horse armor and oxidizing lightning rods, in addition to a slew of bug fixes and technical changes.

Happy mining!

#### Copper Golem Item Sorting

-   If the Copper Golem is not holding an item, it will look for nearby Copper Chests to try to pick up an item
    -   The Copper Golem will look in any oxidized and waxed Copper Chest variant to pick up items
    -   It can pick up at most 16 items in a stack at a time
    -   Any item in a Copper Chest can be picked up
-   If the Copper Golem is holding an item, it will look for nearby Chests to try to place the item in
    -   The Copper Golem will look in Chests and Trapped Chests to try to place items
    -   It can place an item in a Chest if it's empty, or if it contains the same type of item that it is holding in its hand
-   The Copper Golem will visit at most 10 Chests or Copper Chests in sequence to try to pick up or place an item
-   If no matching chest is found the Copper Golem will idle for 7 seconds before trying again
-   The search area for chests from the Copper Golem's position is horizontally 32 blocks and vertically 8 blocks

### Shelf

-   The Shelf is a new type of decorative block which comes in the following variants:
    -   Oak
    -   Spruce
    -   Birch
    -   Jungle
    -   Acacia
    -   Dark Oak
    -   Mangrove
    -   Cherry
    -   Pale Oak
    -   Bamboo
    -   Crimson
    -   Warped
-   The Shelf can be crafted from six matching blocks of any Stripped Log, Stripped Stem or Block of Stripped Bamboo, filling the top and bottom row
    -   This recipe produces 6 Shelves
-   The Shelf can store up to 3 item stacks:
    -   Interacting with any of the 3 slots on its front swaps the player's main hand item with the content of that slot
    -   The Shelf displays all items it contains in front of it, similar to an Item Frame
-   While a Shelf is powered by Redstone, its front texture changes to reflect that it's powered; when placed next to each other, up to 3 powered Shelves will connect
    -   Interacting with a single powered Shelf swaps all its contents with the 3 rightmost items in the player's hotbar
    -   Interacting with two connected Shelves swaps their contents with the 6 rightmost items in the player's hotbar
    -   Interacting with three connected Shelves swaps their contents with all items in the player's hotbar
    -   It does not matter which of the connected Shelves the player interacts with

### Accessibility

-   The "Attack/Destroy" and "Use Item/Place Block" keybinds are now toggleable, meaning they can be set to either "Hold" or "Toggle" in the Controls screen
-   Added "Invert Mouse X" option to the Mouse Settings screen, which inverts the mouse x-axis
-   Added "Sprint Window" option to the Controls screen, which represents the time window in ticks where double-tapping the forward key activates sprint

## Changes

-   Monster Spawn Eggs now have a tooltip warning when the difficulty is set to Peaceful
    -   The mob no longer spawns for one tick when an attempt is made to use the Spawn Egg
-   The debug screen was reworked to be less cluttered and more configurable
-   Changes to world loading and the "Spawn Chunks"
-   A dimension that has any player activity, forceloaded chunks, active portals, or Ender Pearls in flight will be considered "active" and will keep processing chunks and entities
    -   Previously, this would only apply if a player was in the dimension or a chunk was forceloaded

### World Loading and Spawn Chunks

-   The concept of fixed "Spawn Chunks" has been removed
-   The game will ensure that the following chunks are fully loaded before the player joins or the server starts, in the same way as spawn chunks formerly were:
    -   Chunks loaded by the `forceload` command
    -   Chunks active due to portal activity
    -   Ender Pearls thrown in Singleplayer (Singleplayer only)
    -   The small area of chunks around the player (Singleplayer only)
    -   Chunks required to assign the global world spawn (World creation only)
-   The world loading screen now shows the chunks that the player is about to be placed into, rather than chunks loaded around world spawn
-   The loading screen additionally now includes a progress bar
    -   This progress bar accounts for all kinds of chunk loading as mentioned above

> **Developer’s Note:** _Spawn chunks incur a memory and performance cost for all players and have outlived their initial technical purpose of keeping the spawn area ready for players to quickly join into._

> _However, we also want to recognise that spawn chunks have enabled a multitude of clever contraptions and farms throughout the years, so simply removing them without having other mechanics in the game enable these designs was never an option._

> _We believe that the niche held by spawn chunks has now been filled by alternative methods of chunk loading, such as using portals or ender pearls, particularly with the changes in this snapshot to how the game loads these chunks before the world starts ticking._

### Sounds

-   Happy ghast is now audible from 64 blocks
-   Sounds for chests now plays at a lower volume
-   The volume at which a sound is played at now respects the sound source volume value
-   The "Voice/Speech" sound source has been rephrased to "Narrator/Voice"

### UI

#### Debug Screen

-   The debug screen is accessible by pressing F3, as before
-   It can now be accessed from everywhere in the game, not only when in a game world
-   It now displays less information by default
-   Added a new Debug Options screen which can be opened by pressing F3 + F5
    -   It can be used to configure which debug information should be displayed
    -   For each item you can choose if it should be turned off, visible when the debug screen (F3) is open, or it should always be visible, even when the debug screen is closed
    -   Some debug features that were previously available, like chunk border rendering or entity hitbox rendering, can now be toggled through this debug options screen
    -   Some debug features that were not previously available to the community, like Octree visualization, are now accessible through the debug options screen
    -   The state of the debug options screen is saved between the launches of the game
    -   The debug options screen has the following preset profiles:
        -   `Default` resets everything to the default state
        -   `Performance` shows simple performance metrics, including the FPS meter always visible on screen

> **Developer's Note**: _Previously the information gathering every frame to render the F3 screen had a significant performance cost. So opening the screen to check you FPS noticably dropped the FPS. Now checking your FPS in `Performance` profile should not affect game performance._

### Accessibility

-   A button leading to the Controls screen has been added to the Accessibility Settings screen
    
    -   The "Auto-Jump" option, as well as the "Sneak" and "Sprint" toggles have been removed from the Accessibility Settings screen
-   The "Show Subtitles" option has been rephrased to "Closed Captions" to more accurately describe what it does
    
-   Dye Colors now have updated icons
    
    -   The goal with these is to enhance visual cohesion across the dye set while maintaining distinct shapes to support colorblind accessibility

### Performance Improvements

-   Entity rendering order was improved for significantly better performance
    -   You’ll notice much smoother gameplay in areas with lots of mobs, like mob farms
    -   FPS won’t improve much if most of your lag comes from things other than entities, like playing with high render distance while not being near many mobs

> **Developer's Note**: _This change is quite big, and we would not be surprised if we introduced some ordering issues with this. For example, some part of some mob rendering too early or too late and is not visible or is visually broken. Please play around with this and report the bugs you encounter!_

## Technical Changes

-   Pack versions now have minor versions
-   The Data Pack version is now 82.0
-   The Resource Pack version is now 65.0

### Pack Formats

-   The pack versions for data packs and resource packs now have minor versions
    -   A minor version increment of the game's pack version is backwards-compatible, meaning all packs made for previous iterations of the same major version will keep working
-   Packs can set compatibility requirements on minor versions in case they rely on resources introduced in a minor version

#### Pack Metadata

The pack.mcmeta format has been updated:

-   The `supported_formats` field has been removed
    -   If your pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack < 82, resource pack < 65), it is still required
    -   Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed
-   The `pack_format` field is now optional
    -   If your pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack < 82, resource pack < 65), it is still required
-   Added required field `min_format` - specifies the minimum version supported
    -   A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g `[74, 1]`
    -   Specifying a single integer is interpreted as that major version, e.g. `74` is the same thing as `[74, 0]`
    -   Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone
-   Added required field `max_format` - specified the maximum version supported
    -   A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g `[74, 1]`
    -   Specifying a single integer is interpreted as any minor version, i.e. the minor version is `0x7fffffff`
    -   Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone
-   For overlay entries:
    -   The `formats` field has been removed
        -   If your pack includes any overlay range that includes a pack version with the previous format (data pack < 82, resource pack < 65), it is still required for all overlay definitions
        -   Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed
    -   Added required field `min_format` and `max_format` with the same formats the fields above with the same name for the `pack` section

## Data Pack Version 82.0

### Commands

-   The `summon` command now fails when trying to summon monsters while the difficulty is set to Peaceful

### Game Rules

-   Removed `spawnChunkRadius` game rule

### Data Components

#### `blocks_attacks` Item Component

-   If the damage reduced in an attack is `0`, for example by `angle` threshold not matching, the item can no longer get disabled in the attack, nor cause knockback due to blocking

### Loot Tables

-   Added `minecraft:entity_interact` loot table type which takes the following parameters:
    -   `target_entity`, the entity being interacted with
    -   `interacting_entity`, the optional entity that is interacting with the `target_entity`
    -   `tool`, the tool used to interact with `target_entity`
-   Added `minecraft:block_interact` loot table type which takes the following parameters:
    -   `block_state`, the block state of the block entity being interacted with
    -   `block_entity`, the optional block entity being interacted with
    -   `interacting_entity`, the optional entity that is interacting with the `block_state`
    -   `tool`, the optional tool used to interact with `block_state`
-   Fields that specify a target entity in a loot table, such as `entity_properties.entity`, can additionally target the `target_entity` and `interacting_entity` parameter types
-   Added `charged_creeper/root` loot table for drops when an entity is killed by a Charged Creeper
    -   This loot table dispatches on the mob that was killed, to the following loot tables:
        -   `charged_creeper/piglin`
        -   `charged_creeper/creeper`
        -   `charged_creeper/skeleton`
        -   `charged_creeper/wither_skeleton`
        -   `charged_creeper/zombie`
    -   Once any mob killed drops an item from this loot table, other mobs killed by the same Creeper will not drop from this loot table
-   Added `brush/armadillo` loot table for drops when an Armadillo is brushed
-   Added `gameplay/turtle_grow` loot table for drops when a Turtle grows into an adult
-   Added `harvest/beehive` loot table for drops when a Beehive or Bee Nest is harvested using Shears
-   Added `harvest/cave_vine` loot table for drops when a Cave Vine with Glowberries is harvested by interacting with it
-   Added `carve/pumpkin` loot table for drops when a Pumpkin is carved using Shears

### World Generation

-   The `initial_density_without_jaggedness` field in `noise_settings` definitions has been replaced with a `preliminary_surface_level` field
    -   `initial_density_without_jaggedness` was a 3D density function that was used to determine an approximate surface level by scanning for the first point with a density greater than `0.390625`
    -   `preliminary_surface_level` is a 2D density function that should produce the y-level of the approximate surface
    -   The `minecraft:find_top_surface` density function can be used to replicate the previous scanning

#### Density Functions

##### Added `minecraft:find_top_surface`

-   Approximates the topmost surface of a given density function
-   It scans from an upper bound to a lower bound to find the point at which the density changes from negative to positive
    -   The upper bound should be as close to the actual surface for best performance
    -   The upper bound should never be lower than the actual surface

Fields:

-   `density` - density function to approximate the surface of
-   `upper_bound` - 2D density function providing the highest possible y-value
-   `lower_bound` - integer, lowest possible y-value
-   `cell_height` - positive integer defining the grid resolution on which to scan

##### Added `minecraft:invert`

-   Resolves to `1/argument`

Fields:

-   `argument` - density function

#### Jigsaw Structures

-   The `max_distance_from_center` field may now specify a different restriction on the vertical axis from horizontal
    -   This can be specified by an object with fields:
        -   `horizontal` - required integer between `1` and `128`
        -   `vertical` - optional integer between `1` and `4096` (default: `4096`)
        -   e.g: `"max_distance_from_center": { "horizontal": 20, "vertical": 500 }`
    -   The previous format of a single inline value specifying both horizontal and vertical distance is still supported

### Tags

#### Block Tags

-   Added `#copper_chests` - all Copper Chest blocks
-   Added `#copper` - all Copper blocks
-   Added `#incorrect_for_copper_tool` - all blocks which will not drop items with a copper tool
-   Added `#copper_golem_statues` - all Copper Golem Statue blocks

#### Item Tags

### Shaders & Post-process Effects

> **Developer's Note**: _Although it is possible in Resource Packs, overriding Core Shaders is considered as unsupported and not an intended Resource Pack feature. These shaders exist as part of the internal implementation of the game, and as such, may change at any time as the game's internals evolve. We understand that overriding Core Shaders is used for very cool Resource Pack features, many of which lack supported alternatives. We would like to provide better, supported alternatives in the future._

#### Changes to Full Screen Passes

-   The following vertex shaders have been removed, and replaced by `core/screenquad.vsh`:
    -   `core/blit_screen.vsh`
    -   `post/blit.vsh`
    -   `post/blur.vsh`
    -   `post/invert.vsh`
    -   `post/sobel.vsh`
    -   `post/screenquad.vsh`
-   Vertex shaders for post-processing effects, as well as lightmap generation and full screen blits are no longer are passed the `Position` attribute, and instead must assign vertex coordinates by `gl_VertexID`
-   These passes furthermore are only executed with 3 vertices, instead of a full quad
