# Minecraft Snapshot 21w10a

A truly fabulous snapshot enters the arena! This snapshot brings fundamental changes to our rendering pipeline with the introduction of the brand new tech that is OpenGL Core 3.2. On top of that, we're finally introducing the Lush Caves biome. However, as with the Dripstone Caves, this is only available through creating a custom world.

There's an important note about this snapshot for those of you with older computers: With the introduction of OpenGL Core 3.2 there is a chance Minecraft Java will no longer run on computers that do not meet the [minimum system requirements](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360035131371-Minecraft-Java-Edition-system-requirements-). Computers that meet the [minimum system requirements](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360035131371-Minecraft-Java-Edition-system-requirements-) should not be affected.

## New Features in 21w10a

-   Added Lush Caves underground biome!
-   Added Cracked Deepslate Bricks and Cracked Deepslate Tiles
-   There is now an Infested variant of Deepslate found in the underground
-   While they will not generate in the world by default, Deepslate versions of copper, emerald and coal ores have been added for use by creators of maps and data packs

### Lush caves biome

The Lush Caves underground biome now exists for use in single-biome worlds. It does not yet generate in other world types.

-   Moss covers the floors and ceilings
-   Spore Blossoms grow from the ceiling and drip particles
-   Contains clay pools with dripleaf plants grow out of them
-   Contains azalea bushes and flowering azalea bushes
-   The azalea tree loves to have its roots in lush caves, so if you find an azalea tree (either overground or in a cave) you know there is a lush cave beneath you
-   Cave vines with glow berries grow from the ceiling and light up the caves

## Changes in 21w10a

-   Cobbled Deepslate can now be smelted into Deepslate.
-   Deepslate can now be placed along any axis
-   Lightning rods can now be waterlogged
-   Fossils in the deepest part of the underground generate with deepslate diamond ore instead of coal ore
-   Some ore textures have been updated

### Ore distribution

Overworld ore generation has been tweaked.

-   More emeralds in mountains
-   More lapis
-   Less copper, gold, and redstone
-   Smaller diamond blobs, but slightly more frequent. Less diamond ore overall though
-   Less iron, and it generates lower down
-   Reduced air exposure for coal

## Technical Changes in 21w10a

-   The game now runs using OpenGL 3.2 core profile
-   The maximum size that slimes can be summoned with is now 128
-   The `give` command can only give up to 100 stacks of items at a time (e.g. 6400 stone or 100 iron swords)

### OpenGL

Rendering is now using OpenGL 3.2 core profile. All fixed function rendering has been replaced with shader based rendering.

#### Shaders

Shaders are now included for all supported render states. Any shader except for the `blit` shader can also be replaced in resource packs. For now replacing these shaders is **not officially supported** and the way it works may change in the future.

The current rendering engine uses a system similar to the post processing shader pipeline. There are some differences between both system that cater to the slightly different requirements.
