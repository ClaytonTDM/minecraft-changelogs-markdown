# 1.21.6 Pre-Release 1

Hey! This is the first pre-release of 1.21.6. From now on, you will mostly see us fixing bugs and the release schedule might include more than one pre-release per week. We are on the finish line for the second drop of the year!

## Changes

-   The Dried Ghast Block now emits a vibration frequency of 11 when its block state changes
-   Shearing Saddles, Horse Armor, and Carpets now emits a vibration frequency of 6, along with the Unequip frequency of 4
-   The Ambient Dried Ghast sounds are now adjusted under the Blocks sound option instead of the Ambient/Environment option
-   A player riding a Happy Ghast can no longer completely fly through a Happy Ghast ridden by another player

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 79
-   The Resource Pack version is now 63

## Data Pack Version 79

-   Dialogs can now configure if they pause the game and if they close after an action is taken
-   Every dialog can now have inputs and can submit information
    -   The definition of actions has been changed to accommodate that
    -   The dedicated input dialog types have been removed, since they are redundant now
    -   The order of elements is:
        -   Body
        -   Inputs
        -   Actions
-   The `minecraft:custom` click event has been expanded to carry full a NBT tag
-   A new keybind called "Quick Actions" has been added to allow accessing content-configured dialogs

### Quick Actions Keybind

-   A new keybind has been addded that allows users to access a set of dialogs
-   Default key: `G`
-   This feature is configured by `minecraft:quick_actions` dialog tag
    -   If this tag is empty, the keybind does nothing
    -   If this tag has a single element, the keybind will open this dialog
    -   If this tag has multiple elements, the keybind will lead to `minecraft:quick_actions` dialog which (by default) lets user select one of the tag elements
        -   If this dialog is removed, the keybind does nothing
-   This option is intended to be used in custom content and by servers, so this tag is empty by default

### Common Dialog fields

New fields:

-   `pause` - if the dialog screen should pause the game in single-player mode, default: `true`
-   `after_action` - an additional operation performed on the dialog after click or submit actions, default: `close`
    -   `close` - closes the dialog and returns to the previous non-dialog screen (if any)
    -   `none` - does nothing, i.e. keeps the current dialog screen open
        -   only available if `pause` is `false` to avoid locking the game in single-player mode
    -   `wait_for_response` - replace the current dialog with a "Waiting for Response" screen
        -   this option is intended to prevent users from sending multiple actions on slow connections
            -   servers are expected to eventually replace this screen with a new dialog
        -   to avoid accidental locking, a "Back" button will become active after 5 seconds
            -   clicking this button will continue as if the dialog was closed (i.e. the game returns to the previous non-dialog screen, if any)
        -   The "Waiting for Response" screen will unpause the game in single-player mode to avoid locking the game

### Dialog Types

**Changed `minecraft:multi_action`, `minecraft:server_links`, `minecraft:dialog_list`**

-   Replaced field `on_cancel` with `exit_action`, holding an optional action
    -   If `exit_action` is present, a button for it will appear in footer, otherwise the footer is not present
    -   `exit_action` is also used for the Escape action

**Removed `minecraft:simple_input_form`**

-   Since any dialog can now have inputs, this dialog can be replaced by `minecraft:notice`

**Removed `minecraft:multi_action_input_form`**

-   Since any dialog can now have inputs, this dialog can be replaced by `minecraft:multi_action` (without any specified `exit_action`)

### Input Control Types

-   To accomodate the new `minecraft:custom` click event, all inputs will now return either a string or an NBT tag, depending on context

**`minecraft:text`**

-   Output values:
    -   As template substitution: contents without modification
    -   As tag: a string tag with contents without modification

**`minecraft:boolean`**

-   Output values:
    -   As template substitution: `on_true` when checked, `on_false` when unchecked
    -   As tag: `1b` when checked, `0b` when unchecked

**`minecraft:number_range`**

-   Output values:
    -   As template substitution: text representation of current value
        -   Whole numbers will be sent without decimal point
    -   As tag: a float tag with current value

**Dialog Body Types**

Hover and click events on text components within bodies now work as expected

-   Click events are handled by the dialog screen like any other action - that means it will also run the `after_action`

### Actions

-   The format of actions has been changed due to the merging of plain and input dialogs
-   After every action the dialog will always evaluate the contents of the `after_action` field (see above)

Fields:

-   Kept fields: `label`, `tooltip`, `width`
-   New field: `action` (replaces `on_click` and `on_submit`) - an action to perform when button is clicked, optional object with fields:
    -   `type` - value from `minecraft:dialog_action_type` registry
    -   `<type-specific>` - see below, depends on `type`

**Static Dialog Action Types**

All existing `click_event` actions (except for `open_file`) are included as dialog action types.

Uses same format as `click_event` on text components (but with `action` replaced with `type`) For example, when using `show_dialog`, entry for action button will look like:

    {
        "label": "some label",
        "action": {
            "type": "show_dialog",
            "dialog": "some:id"
        }
    }
    

**`minecraft:dynamic/run_command` Action Type**

-   This action will build a `run_command` event using a provided macro template
-   The macro will be expanded with string values from all inputs
    -   For example, if the macro template is `some_command $(some_input)`, the string value from the input with `key` of `some_input` will be used for the template expansion
    -   Inputs not used in macro will be ignored, while macro parameters not matching any inputs will be replaced with an empty string

Fields:

-   `template` - a string with a macro template to be interpreted as a command

**`minecraft:dynamic/custom` Action Type**

-   This method will build a `minecraft:custom` event using all input values
-   All input contents will be sent together inside a compound tag, with tag value of each input put under id from `key` field of that input
-   Additional static fields can be added to payload

Fields:

-   `additions` - fields to be added to payload, optional compound tag
-   `id` - namespaced ID

## Resource Pack version 63

-   Added `oversized_in_gui` item model field
-   Introduced new player head special model type

### Item Models

-   Item model definitions now have a boolean field `oversized_in_gui` which is `false` by default
    -   If `true`, the item model will be allowed to be bigger than its item slot
    -   If `false`, the item model will be clipped to the item slot size when being rendered in gui
    -   This ability of items being rendered outside their slots should not be considered officially supported, it was temporarily restored as an exception since many servers are relying on it
    -   At some point in the future we hope to replace it with an officially supported way of achieving similar functionality
-   Introduced new item model `minecraft:player_head` to handle player profile texture loading and rendering
-   Removed support for `minecraft:profile` from `minecraft:head`

**`minecraft:player_head` special model type**

-   Renders a player head
-   Uses profile from the `minecraft:profile` component to load a texture. Renders a default texture until the profile texture is fully loaded
-   No fields

**`minecraft:head` special model type**

-   No longer supports profile from `minecraft:profile` component to load a player texture
-   Renders a default player texture when `kind` is `player` and no texture override is supplied
-   Fields remain unchanged

---

# Minecraft 1.21.5 Pre-Release 1

Today we're shipping the first pre-release of Minecraft 1.21.5. From now on you will mostly see bug fixes and technical tweaks until the start of the next snapshot cycle. As we enter the pre-release phase we will be releasing more frequently than our regular cadence on Wednesdays, so keep an eye out for the next pre-release!

## Changes

-   Added Spawn Eggs textures for programmer art texture pack

## Technical Changes

-   The Resource Pack version is now 55
-   Arguments in commands that accept inline values like loot tables, predicates, modifiers, data components, formatted text (`/loot`, `/give`, `/tellraw`, `/execute if predicate`, data components in `/execute if items`, etc.) have been reverted to accept numbers in place of booleans

> **Developer's Note**: The original change happened because we moved away from using NBT as an intermediate format for parsing those values, which meant that booleans were separated from numbers (similar to handling in JSON). We've decided to temporarily revert that, since some functionality can't be achieved yet without using storage and macro functions. However, once that missing functionality is added (and data can be transferred without being converted to and from text), legacy boolean handling will be removed once again.

### Network Protocol

-   The clientbound `player_chat` packet now contains an index increasing for every message sent to the client
    -   The index starts at 0 when logging in (or is reset by configuration phase and the `login` packet)
    -   For every message, the server should increment this value by 1
    -   If this value updates in an unexpected way, the client will disconnect
    -   As the protocol requires that every chat packet reaches the client in produced order, the goal is to enable faster detection of missed/reordered chat messages for custom server developers
-   The serverbound `chat` and `chat_command_signed` packets now contain a checksum byte along with the 'last seen' update
    -   This is a simple hash of the 'last seen' signatures which should be reconstructed by the server, allowing quicker detection of desynchronized state
    -   This can be passed as `0` to disable the check, for compatibility with protocol translation

## Resource Pack Version 55

-   Tweaked Leaf Litter block models

## Fixed bugs in 1.21.5 Pre-Release 1

-   [MC-170134](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-170134) Minecraft uses several times more VRAM than needed after exploring terrain for a while

# Minecraft 1.21.4 Pre-Release 1

The first pre-release of Minecraft 1.21.4 is now available. Today's update and for the remainder of the 1.21.4 cycle, you will mostly see bug fixes and tweaks. In addition to that, pre-releases don't follow the regular snapshot cadence of releasing only on Wednesdays, so keep an eye out for the next pre-release.

As always, a big thank you to the community for your feedback, bugs reported, and awesome ideas throughout the snapshot series. Let the pre-releases commence!

## Technical Changes

-   The Resource Pack version is now 46
-   Similarly to block items, Spawn Eggs for entities that could execute operator-only commands now have a warning in tooltip

## Resource Pack Version 46

-   Added a way of suppressing first-person hand animation on item change for specific models
-   Unifont has been updated to 16.0.01

### Item models

-   A new field has been added to the client-side item info format (i.e. files in `/assets/*/items/*.json`)
    -   `hand_animation_on_swap` - boolean field describing if down-and-up animation should be played in first-person view when item stack is changed (either type, count or components), default: `true`
        -   only value from new item is taken into account
        -   does not control "pop" animation in GUI when item is picked or changes count

**`minecraft:model` item model type**

**Added `minecraft:team` tint source type**

-   Returns team color of context entity, if any
-   Fields:
    -   `default` - RGB value to return when there is no context entity, entity is not in a team or team has no color

**Changed `minecraft:head` special model type**

-   Added field `animation` - float controlling head animation (like Piglin ears or Ender Dragon jaw), default: `0.0`

**Added `minecraft:view_entity` boolean property**

-   When not spectating, returns `true` if context entity is the local player entity, i.e. one controlled by client
-   When spectating, returns `true` if context entity is the spectated entity
-   If context entity is not present, will return `false`
-   No fields

**Renamed property `minecraft:holder_type` to `minecraft:context_entity_type`**

**Developer's Note**: _Context entities were initially used only for compasses and clocks, which means that type is available only in rendering contexts where those items would show correct reading (see MC-186797 and related bugs). The name change has been made to better reflect that._

**Added `minecraft:context_dimension` property**

-   Returns the ID of the dimension in context, if any
-   No fields
-   Values: namespaced dimension ID (like `minecraft:overworld`)

**Changed `minecraft:time` numeric property**

-   Removed field `natural_only`
-   Added field `source` - time source, possible values:
    -   `daytime` - time of day
    -   `moon_phase` - moon phase
    -   `random` - random value

**Changed `minecraft:compass` numeric property**

-   Added value `none` to field `target` which always returns an invalid target

**Added `minecraft:empty` item model type**

-   Does not render anything
-   No fields
