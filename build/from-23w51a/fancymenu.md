# Minecraft Snapshot 23w51a

We're now releasing Snapshot 23w51a, the first snapshot for Minecraft 1.20.5. This one comes with a present for your pet Wolf in time for the holidays - and the Armadillo.

Happy brushing!

## New Features

-   Added Armadillo, Armadillo Scutes and Wolf Armor

### Armadillo

-   The Armadillo is a new passive mob that:
    -   drops Armadillo Scutes periodically
    -   drops Armadillo Scutes when brushed
    -   spawns in Savannas
    -   its favorite food is Spider Eye

**Armadillo Rolling Up Behavior**

-   Armadillo rolls up when it detects a threat such as:
    -   a sprinting player
    -   a player in a vehicle or mounted
    -   undead mobs
-   It does not roll up when:
    -   it is fleeing
    -   in water
    -   in the air or
    -   on a leash
-   When an Armadillo is rolled up it does not walk, cannot eat, and will not be tempted by food
    -   It will continue to scan for threats: if none are detected for 3 seconds, it will unroll

**Armadillo Scutes**

-   Armadillo Scutes can be used to craft Wolf Armor
-   They are dropped by Armadillos
-   Dispensers can be used to brush Armadillo Scutes off Armadillos

### Wolf Armor

-   Using Wolf Armor on an adult tamed Wolf will equip the armor on the wolf.
-   Only a Wolf's owner can put a Wolf Armor on their tamed Wolf, and with this in mind; Dispensers cannot put Wolf Armor on wolves.
-   Wolf Armor gives the same protection as Diamond Horse Armor.
-   Using Shears on a Wolf that is wearing armor will make it drop the armor
-   Only a Wolf's owner can shear a Wolf Armor from it, and with this in mind; Dispensers cannot remove Wolf Armor from wolves.
-   If a Wolf dies while wearing armor, it will drop the armor.

## Changes

-   Renamed scutes that come from Turtles to Turtle Scutes
-   Llamas and Shulkers are no longer able to destroy armor stands

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 27

## Data Pack 27

-   Llamas now use a new damage type `spit` instead of `mob_projectile`
-   `FactorCalculationData` has been removed from mob effect instance tags
-   Added `generic.scale` attribute that can be used to rescale any living entity
-   Player reach distance can now be controlled with the `generic.block_interaction_range` and `generic.entity_interaction_range` attributes
-   The maximum number of blocks that an entity can step up without jumping is now controlled by the `generic.step_height` attribute

## Experimental Features

### Breeze

-   Added a new 'whirl' idle sound
-   Added a 'charging up attack' sound
-   Added a sound that plays while the Breeze is in the air
-   Added a projectile deflection sound
-   Tweaked existing sounds

### Trial Spawner

-   The Trial Spawner now has the same two default loot tables as they have in the Trial Chamber

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w46a

This snapshot brings about a few redstone-focused changes. Notably, we‚Äôre tweaking the tick delay behavior of the crafter and the copper bulb while they‚Äôre still in experimental development.

With these changes, we aim to make the crafter more consistent with other blocks that drop or eject items, and the copper bulb with other blocks that react or change state when a connected redstone signal changes. As a result of this, some contraptions built during the last few snapshots may no longer work properly.

We're really excited about the tinkering opportunities both these new redstone blocks bring to the world. Please keep sending all your thoughts about them to Minecraft Feedback so we can keep building Minecraft together!

Enjoy!

## Changes

-   Updated Crafter textures

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 25

## Data Pack Version 25

-   Added individual display names for scoreboard entries

### Commands

**`scoreboard`**

**Display names**

-   Each entry in a scoreboard can now have a custom display name
-   Those values are kept separate per objective and score holder
-   If the name is not present, the score holder name is used (i.e. the old behavior)
-   If the score is reset or the whole objective is removed, the name is not preserved
-   Team decorations will still be applied to names as normal
-   Subcommands for managing names:
    -   `scoreboard players display name <targets> <objective> <text component>` - set display name
    -   `scoreboard players display name <targets> <objective>` - clear display name

**Display name auto-update**

-   To make display name management easier, objectives can also be configured to auto-update display names on every score update
-   This option is disabled by default
-   If a score holder has no display name (because it can't be attributed to any currently loaded entity), the current name is preserved
-   Command to control auto-update for objective:
    -   `scoreboard objectives modify <scoreboard> displayautoupdate [true|false]`

**Number formatting**

-   Scores in numeric form can now be formatted
-   Formats can be set for both objectives and individual scores
-   Scores with set formats will render the same in all context (sidebar, under player name, etc.)
-   Subcommands for managing formats:
    -   `scoreboard objectives modify <objective> numberformat <format>` - for setting default format for an objective
    -   `scoreboard objectives modify <objective> numberformat` - for clearing default format for an objective
    -   `scoreboard players display numberformat <targets> <score> <format>` - for setting format for a specific score holder
    -   `scoreboard players display numberformat <targets> <score>` - for clearing format for a specific score holder

Formats:

-   `styled <style>` - score will be displayed with selected style (like `{"bold":true}`)
-   `fixed <text component>` - score will be replaced with text
-   `blank` - score will not be displayed

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w45a

We're happy to share another snapshot, this time offering an early look at some exciting new adventures waiting for you underground in the form of Trial Chambers!

Trial Chambers are designed to be challenging moments of combat and exploration hidden medium-deep below the surface of the Overworld. Trial Chambers bring new decorative and lighting blocks, new Trial Spawners to deliver a different style of multi-mob fights, and the bushy-browed Breeze, a new mob specific to Trial Chambers which will add quite a bit of chaos to your combats.

Happy Mining!

## Changes

-   Monster Spawner now renders their inner faces when looking inside

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 24
-   The Resource Pack version is now 21

## Data Pack Version 24

-   Added experimental Breeze mob
-   Added experimental Trial Spawner block
-   Increased maximum value of Jigsaw structure variable `size` from 7 to 20
-   Added `trial_chambers_copper_bulb_degradation` structure processor list

## Resource Pack Version 21

-   `uniform` font has been updated to use Unifont 15.1.04 (from 15.0.06)
-   The only supported texture format is now .png

### Breeze Mob

-   Added entity models and textures for experimental Breeze mob:
    -   `breeze`, `wind_charge`
-   Added shader:
    -   `breeze_wind`

## Experimental Features

### Added Breeze mob

-   The Breeze is a cunning, hostile mob that can spawn via Trial Spawner in some rooms within the Trial Chambers
-   The Breeze moves primarily by leaping around the target, sometimes jumping quite long distances
-   An aggressive adversary, the Breeze shoots volatile wind energy in the form of wind charge projectiles at its target
-   Wind charges deal a small amount of damage when colliding directly with an entity
-   After colliding with an entity or a block, wind charge projectiles produce a wind burst, which knocks back entities in the area by several blocks
-   Wind bursts also have the effect of 'activating' certain blocks:
    -   Non-Iron Doors and Trapdoors are flipped
    -   Fence Gates are flipped
    -   Buttons are pressed
    -   Levers are flipped
    -   Bells are rung and swung
    -   Lit Candles (both standalone and on cake) are extinguished
-   Wind bursts do not have any effect on Iron Doors, Iron Trapdoors, or any block being held in its position by a Redstone signal

### Trial Spawner

-   Trial Spawner is a new variant of Monster Spawners that ejects rewards upon completion and can have variable levels of challenge in multiplayer
-   The challenge level will increase for each new player a Trial Spawner notices nearby
    -   Challenge level will not decrease until it is reset during a Trial Spawner's cooldown
-   Unlike normal spawners, a Trial Spawner will spawn a limited number of mobs proportional to its current challenge level
    -   It can only spawn a mob at positions that are within line of sight
    -   It can spawn a mob regardless of any light level requirement the mob has
    -   Spawned mobs are persistent
-   Once all mobs are defeated, the Trial Spawner will eject a set of rewards proportional to the current challenge level
    -   After the rewards have been ejected, the Trial Spawner goes into cooldown for 30 minutes during which it will no longer spawn mobs
-   Trial Spawners cannot be crafted nor obtained by players in Survival - instead, they can be found naturally placed throughout Trial Chambers
-   Trial Spawners are extremely slow to mine and resistant to explosions, and will not drop even with Silk Touch
-   When placed in Creative, Trial Spawners have no mob type set by default
    -   The mob type can be set by interacting with it while holding a Spawn Egg
-   Creative and Spectator players cannot be detected or noticed by Trial Spawners

### Trial Chambers

-   Trial Chambers are a new structure in the Overworld where players can explore and take on combat challenges during the mid-game
    -   Trial Chambers are made out of a variety of Copper and Tuff blocks and can be found in different sizes from large to small
    -   Trial Chambers are a relatively common find throughout the Deepslate layer of the underground
-   The layout of each Trial Chamber is procedurally generated, and can include traps, reward chests and a variety of combat spaces
    -   Supply chests can be found between different rooms, and give you blocks and items which help you navigate your trials
    -   Reward chests are guarded by challenges in each room, and can be a source of many high level enchanted books and equipment
    -   The loot found in reward chests are still being iterated, and are absolutely not final
-   Each Trial Chamber will include Trial Spawners with a melee, small melee, or ranged category:
    -   Melee
        -   Zombie
        -   Husk
        -   Slime
    -   Small Melee
        -   Spider
        -   Cave Spider
        -   Baby Zombie
        -   Silverfish
    -   Ranged
        -   Skeleton
        -   Stray
        -   Skeleton with Poison Tipped Arrows
-   Each Trial Spawner category will only use one mob for the entire structure when generated, and these mobs are randomized for each Trial Chamber
    -   For example, one Trial Chamber might only spawn Zombies, Cave Spiders and Strays, while another might only spawn Slimes, Silverfish and Skeletons
    -   The exceptions to this are some Trial Spawners in unique rooms which always spawn Breezes

**Known issues**

-   The corridors sometimes end with a dead end
-   Aquifers, Lush Caves, and Sculk Veins sometimes intersect with the Trial Chamber

### Trial Key

-   An item that can only be obtained from Trial Spawners
-   Trial Keys do not currently have any functionality

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w44a

In this week's Snapshot we're taking a break from new features to improve ones we've already added, including fixes to Commands and the ability to use Loot Tables with Decorated Pots.

## Changes

-   Copper Doors & Copper Trapdoors has updated textures

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 23

## Data Pack Version 23

-   Decorated Pots can now utilize loot tables and will read from the `LootTable` tag key
-   Additional changes to command functions

### Commands

**`tick`**

-   The `<time>` parameter in the `tick step` command is now optional. The default value is 1

**`return`**

-   `return run` will now always return
    -   If there are no valid results from returned command, function containing `return run` will fail (i.e. `success=0` and `result=0`)
-   `return run` will now propagate success value together with results value (previously it always set success to `1`)
-   `return run` now also allows storing values - that means `execute store ... run return run some_command` will both store value and return it outside function
-   New subcommand `return fail` is added to make whole function fail (i.e. return `success=0` and `result=0`)

**`function`**

-   If `function <function tag>` runs multiple functions in combination with `return run`, execution will stop after first `return` in any of the functions
-   A single call to the `function` command will always have return when run with `return run`
    -   For example, `return run execute [split context] run function <some function with conditional return>` will always return after processing the first context

**`execute if|unless function`**

-   `execute if|unless function` will no longer always fail if all functions had no return
    -   If there were no `returns` in called functions, `if` will fail and `unless` will pass
    -   First `return` in any of called functions will return (for a single context)

## Fixed bugs in Snapshot 23w44a

-   [MC-219293](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-219293) When teleporting via Chorus Fruit, the burping and teleporting sounds play at the wrong location
-   [MC-265805](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-265805) Executing a tail-recursive function consumes memory resources linearly with recursion depth

## Changes

-   The Bat now has a new look
-   Thrown Ender Pearls produce a teleportation sound on impact
-   Small tweaks to the Telemetry Data Collection screen

### Bat

-   The Bat has an updated model, animations and texture

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 22
-   The Resource Pack version is now 20

## Data Pack Version 22

-   Added `tick` command
-   Added two new input fields for Selection Priority and Placement Priority in the Jigsaw block edit screen
-   Added `item` to `minecraft:arrow` and `minecraft:spectral_arrow`, this is the item that will be picked up
-   Renamed `Trident` to `item` in `minecraft:trident`

### `tick` command

Added a new `tick` command. This is an adminstative and debugging command that allows to control the ticking flow and measure the performance of the game. The command requires elevated permissions (admins and above) and so it is not by default available in command blocks and datapacks.

Syntax:

`tick query` - outputs the current target ticking rate, with information about the tick times performance.

`tick rate <rate>` - sets a custom target ticking rate to the specified value. The value must be greater than 1.0 and lower than 10000.0. Setting a very low tick rate can cause the game to feel unresponsive and setting too high tick rate for your system can cause the game to crash as the game now assumes, it is constantly falling behind the ticking target. Please use `tick query` or `<F3> + 2` (Integrated server only) debug screen to measure the performance of the game and adjust the tick rate accordingly. Setting a tick target lower than the default `20.0` will also cause the players to be simulated at a lower rate (including player movement and input controls), while setting a higher tick rate will cause the players to be simulated at the default rate of `20` ticks per second to maintain the expected responsiveness of the game, but can cause artifacts in entities interpolation.

`tick freeze` - freezes all gameplay elements, except for players and any entity a player is riding. This is useful for debugging and isolating issues with the game allowing the player to move around freely and inspect the world.

`tick step <time>` - Only works when the game is frozen. It runs the game for the specified number of ticks and then freezes the game again. This allows to step through the game a set amount of ticks at a time.

`tick step stop` - stops the current stepping process, and re-freezes the game.

`tick unfreeze` - unfreezes the game and resumes all gameplay elements.

`tick sprint <time>` - runs the game while ignoring the set ticking target rate (meaning that the game will run as fast as possible) for the specified number of ticks. At the end of the sprint, the game will resume the previous ticking target and display performance information about the tick times while sprinting. This is especially useful for testing gameplay elements that are time dependent, such as redstone contraptions, or mob behaviour in isolated environments that allow for much faster simulation.

`tick sprint stop` - stops the current tick sprint, and resumes the previous ticking target.

### Jigsaw Selection & Placement Priority

-   Selection Priority
    -   When the parent piece is being processed for connections, this controls the order in which this Jigsaw block attempts to connect to its target piece
    -   Jigsaws will be processed in descending priority order and randomly within the same priority
-   Placement Priority
    -   When this Jigsaw block connects to a piece, this is the order in which that piece is processed for connections in the wider structure
    -   Pieces will be processed in descending priority order with the default insertion order breaking ties within the same priority
-   This functionality has been added to support the ability for Jigsaw structures to generate branches in a depth-first order, as well as give finer control over ordering of connections
-   All existing Jigsaw blocks will default their Selection and Placement Priority to 0, resulting in the same behaviour as before these two configurable values were introduced

## Resource Pack Version 20

-   `bat.png` has been updated for the new Bat model
-   Added block models, items models and block state definitions for the following blocks:
    -   `chiseled_copper`, `exposed_chiseled_copper`, `weathered_chiseled_copper`, `oxidized_chiseled_copper`

    -   `copper_door`, `exposed_copper_door`, `weathered_copper_door`, `oxidized_copper_door`
    -   `copper_trapdoor`, `exposed_copper_trapdoor`, `weathered_copper_trapdoor`, `oxidized_copper_trapdoor`
    -   `tuff_stairs`
    -   `tuff_slab`
    -   `tuff_wall`
    -   `chiseled_tuff`
    -   `polished_tuff`

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w42a

Hey! Today we bring you the first of the features we've shown you during Minecraft Live last weekend: the Crafter!

## Experimental Features

### Crafter

-   The Crafter is a new block that enables the crafting of items and blocks via Redstone
-   The Crafter will eject one crafted item at a time when powered by a new Redstone signal / pulse (not a continuous signal)
-   Upon receiving this new signal, the Crafter will eject the recipe result from the front face
-   If the output result has multiple type of items all the result items will be ejected together
-   The Crafter can be oriented in any direction when placed

**Crafter UI**

-   The Crafter has a 3x3 interactable crafting grid
-   The Crafter‚Äôs crafting grid slots are toggleable, meaning that the player can change the behavior of a slot by clicking or pressing on a slot with an empty hand
-   A slot that is ‚Äòtoggled‚Äô cannot hold any items, and therefore cannot have items placed into it by other blocks, such as Hoppers and Droppers
-   Unlike the Crafting Table, the Crafter displays a preview of the crafted item which will be crafted and ejected on the next Redstone pulse but cannot be manually taken out by the player
-   The Crafter UI is shared between all players interacting with the Crafter, meaning that multiple players can interact with the Crafter at the same time, similar to Chests and Hoppers

**Crafter interaction with other blocks**

-   The Comparator signal strength is 0-9, where each non-empty or toggled slot adds 1 strength
-   Hoppers can be used to both insert and pull out items from the Crafter
-   Droppers can be used to insert items into the Crafter
-   Moving items in from another block (ex: Hopper, Dropper) prioritizes filling items into slots following these rules:
    -   Prioritize the first empty slot (from left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
    -   If there are no empty slots then prioritize the smallest stack of the same item (pick the first if there are multiple)
    -   If there is a toggled slot it will be skipped. The item will then be moved into the container
    -   If the item cannot be moved, it will be ejected into the world

We want to hear your feedback on the Crafter, so please let us know what you think the over in our dedicated [feedback thread](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/20459106029709-Let-s-talk-about-the-Crafter-).

## Changes

-   Added an accessibility option that allows to hide the yellow splash texts in the main menu
-   Added a recovery screen for worlds with missing data (for example, if saving failed due to an unexpected shutdown)

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 21
-   The Resource Pack version is now 19
-   Minor changes to chat component serialization

### Chat components

**Serialization**

-   The optional `type` field has a new allowed value: `selector`
-   Components of type `nbt` now have `source` field with allowed values `entity`, `block`, `storage`

## Data Pack Version 21

-   Introduced Jigsaw structure pool aliases, which can be used to rewire pool selection
-   Added field `block_state` to `tnt` entity to allow replacement of rendered block model
-   Renamed field `Fuse` to `fuse` on `tnt` entity
-   Added `playersNetherPortalDefaultDelay` and `playersNetherPortalCreativeDelay` gamerules to control time (in ticks) that a player needs to stand in a Nether portal before changing dimensions
-   Added new gamerule `projectilesCanBreakBlocks` to control whether impact projectiles will destroy blocks that are destructible by them, i.e. Chorus Flowers, Pointed Dripstone and Decorated Pots
-   Added `white_smoke` particle type

### Jigsaw pool aliases

-   Added optional `pool_aliases` list to Jigsaw structures
-   Aliases represent the possibility to rewire Jigsaw pool connections by redirecting pool references on individual structure instances
-   Alias variants are represented in `type` and is one of:
    -   `direct` 1:1 mapping from an alias to a new pool
        -   `alias` pool to replace
        -   `target` pool to replace with
    -   `random` 1:n mapping where a pool from `n` is randomly selected for the structure instance
        -   `alias` pool to replace
        -   `targets` randomized list of candidate pools to replace `alias` with
    -   `random_group`
        -   `groups` each group is a randomized list of above alias types
        -   only one group is selected per structure instance
        -   this enables modelling selections such as "if pool X is replaced with X1, also replace pool Y with Y1"

## Resource Pack Version 19

-   Added block model, item model and block state definitions for `crafter`
-   Added GUI container texture and sprites for `crafter`
-   Added `white_smoke` particle definition
