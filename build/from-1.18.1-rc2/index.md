# Minecraft 1.18 Pre-Release 1

The first 1.18 pre-release is here!

From now on, you should mostly see bugs being fixed. In addition to that, pre-releases don't follow the regular snapshot cadence of releasing on Wednesdays, so keep an eye out!

That being said, this pre-release introduces biome blending, which means that you should no longer find harsh borders between new and old terrain. On top of that, we've also reintroduced the Amplified and Large Biome world types.

Happy mining!

## Changes in 1.18 Pre-Release 1

-   Amplified and Large biome worlds have been adapted to the new terrain and are now once again available in the Create World screen
-   Removed world types "Caves" and "Floating islands" from the world creation screen
-   The transition between new and old terrain is less "cliffy"
    -   Will surface height blend? Yes
    -   Will biomes blend? Yes
    -   Will caves blend? Your mileage may vary

## Technical changes in 1.18 Pre-Release 1

-   `--report` option in data generator now creates full worldgen reference files instead of just biomes

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w44a

Another snapshot is now available. We've added new world generation below existing chunks, and blocks and fluids are now also part of the simulation distance setting. We also fixed a few bugs.

Keep in mind that we're still working on the world upgrades, so making a backup before upgrading is still a good idea.

Enjoy!

## New Features in 21w44a

-   New world generation is now inserted under existing chunks when upgrading a world to the new world height
-   Added an Online options screen where you can now find the Realms Notifications option and Difficulty when on a server
-   Added an "Allow Server Listings" option to opt-out of having your name displayed in server listings

## Changes in 21w44a

-   Sleeping now only resets the weather cycle if it was raining
-   Blocks and fluids are now also affected by simulation distance. It might be a good idea to test that the behavior of your Redstone contraptions remained the same
-   Optimized entity collisions

## Technical Changes in 21w44a

-   Servers can now set property `hide-online-players` to `true` in order to not send a player list on status requests
-   When JFR profiling is started from an external source, the JFR events for network packets are now aggregated instead of one event per packet

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w43a

Here's a snapshot from the blender! In this snapshot, world generation around the edges of an old world will now be adjusted for a smoother transition! This is the first iteration of this system which we expect to keep improving. Keep in mind that if you try it out now, the result will be saved to your world forever - which, as we know, is quite a long time. Better be safe than sorry. Make a backup before you try it!

Also - the space underneath existing chunks is now filled in, but only with deepslate. We will later be adding full cave generation in this place, so if you want that in your world, make a backup before you try it!

Due to some updates to terrain generation in this snapshot, seeds have shuffled once again so worlds will not look like they did in the previous snapshot. We expect world seeds to be stable after this snapshot.

Oh yeah, did we mention that it's a good idea to make a backup?

## New Features in 21w43a

-   The edge between old and new world generation is now adjusted when you upgrade a world

### Upgrading of old worlds

-   When generating close to old chunks hew terrain is adjusted to better match the existing terrain at the borders
-   In old chunks, if there is Bedrock at y=0, the column below will be filled with Deepslate
    -   Worlds upgraded in this snapshot will permanently have this deepslate, so if you want new caves under height 0 later, make sure to keep a backup before upgrading
-   The old Bedrock between y=0 and y=4 in old chunks gets replaced with Deepslate
-   A new Bedrock layer is placed at y=-64

## Changes in 21w43a

-   The Priority Updates video setting has been renamed to Chunk Builder
-   Reduced the amount of flooded caves near river and ocean coastlines
-   Aquifer water levels change less often, so you'll more often have larger areas with the same water level. This means slightly fewer underground waterfalls and slightly easier underground boat travel
-   Lava aquifers are slightly less common
-   Restricted Big Dripleaf placement to Clay, Grass, Dirt, Farmland, Moss, Rooted Dirt, Podzol and Mycelium

## Technical Changes in 21w43a

-   Some internal details of block and fluid ticking have been changed to improve save times. While it should behave exactly as it was, it might be a good time to test your redstone contraptions (on a copy of a world or with a backup, of course)
-   The Chunk format has been updated

### World Data: Chunk Format

-   Removed chunk's `Level` and moved everything it contained up
-   Chunk's `Level.Entities` has moved to `entities`
-   Chunk's `Level.TileEntities` has moved to `block_entities`
-   Chunk's `Level.TileTicks` and `Level.ToBeTicked` have moved to `block_ticks`
-   Chunk's `Level.LiquidTicks` and `Level.LiquidsToBeTicked` have moved to `fluid_ticks`
-   Chunk's `Level.Sections` has moved to `sections`
-   Chunk's `Level.Structures` has moved to `structures`
-   Chunk's `Level.Structures.Starts` has moved to `structures.starts`
-   Chunk's `Level.Sections[].BlockStates` and `Level.Sections[].Palette` have moved to a container structure in `sections[].block_states`
-   Chunk's `Level.Biomes` are now paletted and live in a similar container structure in `sections[].biomes`
-   Added `yPos` the minimum section y position in the chunk
-   Added `below_zero_retrogen` containing data to support below zero generation
-   Added `blending_data` containing data to support blending new world generation with existing chunks

## Fixed bugs in 21w43a

-   [MC-131930](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-131930) Deep warm ocean generates without coral and sea pickles
-   [MC-156616](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-156616) Badlands layers not generating properly

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w42a

It's time for a musical snapshot! We're now introducing new music for Caves & Cliffs: Part II. This time around we have a bunch of new tracks composed by the talented Lena Raine and Kumi Tanioka. These tracks are also available on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/7yQIrNTf3pBu0FdyAJqTqb?si=CC31NZyIQrOl-MNVCNYYkQ) for you to listen to, and they will soon be available on other services such as Apple Music and YouTube as well.

This snapshot also includes a few additional tweaks, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

**We still highly recommend backing up your world before loading it in this snapshot.**

## New Features in 21w42a

-   New music has been added to the game
-   Added world autosave indicator for single-player worlds

### Music

-   Added new music by Lena Raine and Kumi Tanioka to the Overworld (when playing in survival mode) and the main menu
-   Added a new music disc from Lena Raine titled 'otherside'. This can be found rarely in Stronghold corridor chests or much more rarely in Dungeon chests.

## Changes in 21w42a

-   World spawn selection algorithm has been reworked, now spawns player according to climate parameters
-   World generation tweaks

### World Generation

-   Lava springs can generate in mountains and snowy terrain
-   Water springs don't generate higher than y 192, and are slightly less common
-   Badlands gold generates higher up

## Technical Changes in 21w42a

-   Replaced `light` and `barrier` particles with `block_marker`

### Particles

#### `block_marker`

-   Renders with texture declared in `particle` slot for model assigned to configured block state
-   Summoned with same syntax as `block` particle (i.e. `block_marker wheat[age=2]`)

## Bugs fixed in 21w42a

-   [MC-129912](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-129912) Player no longer spawned at highest level at world spawn

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w41a

Have a random snapshot! In this snapshot, we've replaced the random number generator used for world generation, which makes more seeds come out as different... but it also moves everything around in the world, so expect all worlds to look different in this snapshot.

Another thing that we've replaced is the cubemap - the spinning image that you see behind the main menu. It's pretty sweet!

Also, in case you missed it, we're having our [annual Minecraft Live event](https://www.minecraft.net/live) this Saturday. Make sure to check that out!

**We still highly recommend backing up your world before loading it in this snapshot.**

## Changes in 21w41a

-   The main menu backdrop now shows a Caves & Cliffs: Part II scene
-   Badlands mineshafts generate higher up
-   Geodes now only generate up to height 30 and their rarity has been adjusted to match 1.17 levels
-   The angle at which sprinting against a block does not break your sprint has been increased a bit

## Technical Changes in 21w41a

-   Changed the prioritization order of the chunk rendering pipeline
    -   Unrendered chunk holes in the world should not appear anymore while flying fast with high render distance
-   Server classes are now signed
-   New random number generator for Overworld generation

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w40a

Badabee badablurb.

**We still highly recommend backing up your world before loading it in this snapshot.**

## Changes in 21w40a

-   World generation tweaks
-   Changes to mob spawning
-   Copper Ore now drops 2-5 (from 2-3) Raw Copper items
-   In the Stonecutter, a Block of Copper can be converted to four Cut Copper
-   A bunch of biome variant with similar features but different shapes have been merged into one, since the shape is controlled independently now
-   Renamed some biomes

### World Generation

-   Updated ore distribution to make branch mining deep down more rewarding. [Updated ore distribution chart](TODO)
    -   For example, added more unexposed diamonds
    -   Iron ore now generates above 80, with more iron ore as you go higher
    -   Extra gold generates below height -48
-   Non-cave biomes no longer change with height - so no more savannas in the sky and things like that
-   Tweaked the relative size of some biomes to match 1.17 a bit closer.
-   Increased the average size of most biomes (this also means biomes aren't in the same places as before)
-   Fixed some aquifer issues (a side effect of this is that aquifers are in different places now compared to last snapshot)
-   Slightly increased the frequency of underwater magma
-   Increased the amount of dungeons, especially below height 0
-   Gravel now generates below height 0
-   Villages are slightly more spread out
-   Removed water lake features, Aquifers provide local water levels

### Mob Spawns

-   Axolotls now only spawn in water, above clay blocks, in lush caves
-   Glowsquids now only spawn in water blocks, under height 30
-   Cod, Salmon, Pufferfish, Tropical Fish, Squid and Dolphins now only spawn in water from height 50 to height 64
-   Tropical Fish now also spawn in lush caves at any height
-   Zombies once again spawn in dripstone caves - drowned can also spawn there however
-   Goats no longer spawn in stony peaks

## Technical Changes in 21w40a

-   Optimized AI for Axolotls, Goats, Hoglins, Zoglins, Piglins, Piglin Brutes and Villagers
-   Bedrock layers generate dependent on the world seed now

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w39a

Time for an Advanced snapshot! In this snapshot, you can also open worlds from previous versions again - with one big warning! The blending technology we intend to introduce for Caves & Cliffs: Part II is not yet available. If you open an old world in this snapshot it will be upgraded with air under the current bottom of the world and visible chunk borders to new areas.

**We highly recommend backing up your world before loading it in this snapshot.**

## New Features in 21w39a

-   Added Caves & Cliffs: Part II Advancements

### Advancements

-   Added "Caves & Cliffs" for falling from top to bottom of the Overworld
-   Added "Feels like home" for riding strider on lava for 50 blocks in the Overworld
-   Added "Star Trader" for trading with a villager at the build height limit
-   Added "Sound of Music" for playing music with a jukebox in a Meadow biome

## Changes in 21w39a

-   Tweaked peaks to make small mountains look more like proper jagged mountain peaks instead of flat hilly mounds
-   The lone trees in Meadows now always contain a bee nest
-   Drowned can spawn in aquifers inside dripstone caves
-   Zombies don't spawn in dripstone caves
-   Buried treasure chests can now contain water breathing potions
-   Changed default brightness to 50
-   Redesigned how effects look in the inventory screen, to allow them to show even with recipe book open

### Effects

-   Your list of effects are now shown to the right of your inventory, instead of the left side
-   When the inventory effects list is visible, it will be hidden from the game view to reduce screen clutter
-   There's now two modes of seeing the effect list: compact and classic
    -   Classic is the pre-existing list of effects, one after another
    -   Compact is a single icon for each effect, suitable for small screen estate
-   The game will automatically switch between the two looks to suit the available screen estate (including having the recipe book open)

## Technical Changes in 21w39a

-   Added `fall_from_height` and `ride_entity_distance` advancement triggers
-   Changed `nether_travel` to match other similar triggers
-   Added new loot table function `set_potion`
-   Changes to the on-disk chunk format
-   Resource pack format has been increased to 8
-   Standalone `server.jar` now bundles contains individual libraries instead of being flat archive

### Advancements

#### New triggers

##### `fall_from_height`

-   Triggered when a player lands after falling
-   Conditions:
    -   `player` - a player for which this trigger runs
    -   `start_position` - location predicate for last position before falling started
    -   `distance` - predicate for distance between `start_position` and player

##### `ride_entity_in_lava`

-   Triggered for every tick when player rides in lava
-   Conditions
    -   `player` - a player for which this trigger runs
    -   `start_position` - position where riding started (first tick on lava)
    -   `distance` - predicate for distance between `start_position` and player

#### Changed triggers

##### `nether_travel`

-   `entered` condition renamed to `start_position`
-   `exited` has been removed, since it was identical to `player.location`

### Loot Tables

#### New functions

##### `set_potion`

Sets `Potion` tag on any item

###### Parameters:

-   `id` - potion id

### World Data: Chunk Format

-   Chunk's `Level.Sections[].BlockStates` & `Level.Sections[].Palette` have moved to a container structure in `Level.Sections[].block_states`
-   Chunk's `Level.Biomes` are now paletted and live in a similar container structure in `Level.Sections[].biomes`
-   Chunk's `Level.CarvingMasks[]` is now `long[]` instead of `byte[]`

### Resource Pack format

-   `minecraft/textures/gui/container/inventory.png` now contains an extra sprite for a thin-layout version of the effect list in the inventory

### Server bundling

-   `server.jar` now bundles individual libraries instead of merging all the files into single archive
-   This change is meant to solve certain problems related to Java modules
-   On startup, `server.jar` will unpack libraries into directory configured by `bundlerRepoDir` (default: working directory)
-   To run different main class than server, use `bundlerMainClass` property (for example `java -DbundlerMainClass=net.minecraft.data.Main -jar server.jar --reports`) or unpack jar manually and use contents of `META-INF/classpath-joined` for command line

## Fixed bugs in 21w39a

-   [MC-116359](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-116359) Status effects aren't displayed in inventory when recipe book is open
-   [MC-149822](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-149822) Bottom border on status effect displays in the inventory is missing
-   [MC-193348](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-193348) Status effect bars shift the player's inventory in creative mode

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w38a

The second Caves & Cliffs: Part II snapshot is here! This snapshot mostly contains tweaks and bug fixes, but there are also some new technical additions such as a separate simulation distance slider and an increased thread count (no I'm not talking about the fancy sheets you're thinking about buying).

Oh, and you also seemed to enjoy Strongholds quite a lot, so we decided to add them back into the game. Enjoy!

## Known Issues in 21w38a

-   This snapshot is still not compatible with older worlds - to play in this snapshot, you will have to create a new world
-   World saving can sometimes take a very long time - if you see the world stop moving for a time, this is why

## Changes in 21w38a

-   Sprinting is no longer reduced to walking when gently brushing your sleeve against a wall
-   Fixes for the distribution of ores

### Ore distribution

-   Copper ore generates up to y 95 (as originally designed)
-   Increased the amount of copper
-   Lapis lazuli generates in blobs, like other ores (instead of spread out)

### Sprinting

-   Previously, any collision with a block would reduce sprinting to walking. Now, for very minor angles of collision with a block, players retain their sprint. For larger angles of collision, the old behavior is retained.

## Technical Changes in 21w38a

-   A new setting has been added: "Simulation distance"
-   Maximum amount of background threads increased
-   Added telemetry for world loading

### Simulation distance setting

-   Entities will not be updated outside of simulation distance.
-   Allows higher render distance with less CPU load.
-   A new slider in video settings on the client.
-   A new `simulation-distance` property in dedicated server properties.
-   We will continue working on it with a goal of simulation distance also affecting block and fluid ticking.

### Maximum amount of background threads increased

Various background tasks including worldgen are executed on a background thread pool. Its size equals the amount of available CPU threads minus one, but there was an upper limit of 7. Now this upper limit is 255. This should help higher-end machines with world-gen performance.

The upper limit can be overridden by `max.bg.threads` Java system property, for example when running multiple servers on a single machine.

### Telemetry

In this release, we are re-introducing diagnostic tracking, which was part of Minecraft: Java Edition until 2018. We are bringing it back to better understand our players and to improve their experience. Specifically, we hope to ensure stronger performance for the extremely heavy world generation in the second part of the Caves & Cliffs update later this year.

In practice, this can mean identifying technical pain points in the game, like how less powerful hardware performs in high-complexity terrain. This information will also help us prioritize various aspects of development, balance game features (by learning, for instance, that the goats are pushing every single player off the cliffs) and lend new Minecrafters a helping hand (after realizing that many of them get stuck at the same points). All data is treated according to GDPR and CCPA best practices and is used to develop a better-performing and generally more enjoyable Minecraft: Java Edition.

At this point the only implemented event is world load.

#### World Load event

-   Sent when loading singleplayer world or connecting to multiplayer server
-   Contains following information:
    -   launcher identifier
    -   user identitifer (XUID)
    -   client session id (changes on restart)
    -   world session id (changes per world load, to be reused for later events)
    -   game version
    -   operating system name and version
    -   Java runtime version
    -   if client or server is modded (same information as on crash logs)
    -   server type (single player, Realms or other)
    -   game mode

## Bugs fixed in 21w38a

-   [MC-44055](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-44055) Game fails to switch the audio output from one device to another after the game has started (from title screen)
-   [MC-236611](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-236611) No sound for using shears on weeping, twisting, cave vines or kelp

-   [MC-236633](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-236633) Random light level of 0 in sky
-   [MC-236656](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-236656) Crash when changing render distance / java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 28084 out of bounds for length 26136
-   [MC-236665](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-236665) Memory leak in 21w37a
-   [MC-236698](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-236698) Big Spruce Trees don't generate in Groves
-   [MC-236711](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-236711) Starting and stopping JFR profiling multiple times within the same minute overwrites previous JFR results saved during that minute
-   [MC-236718](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-236718) Dripstone caves generate above the ground
-   [MC-236795](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-236795) Cannot start with alternate JVM due to JFR requirement
-   [MC-236873](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-236873) Problems with JFR event metadata

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w37a

Marvellous mountains and colossal caves, this snapshot has it all! Today we're bringing the Overworld revamp to regular snapshots. If you've been playing or checking out the experimental snapshots that we've been releasing, you should be familiar with what you're seeing. If not, you're in for a treat!

Since we're extending the world height, and there are quite a few under-the-hood changes, we've been keeping an eye on how the game is running, and there are still improvements to be made. However, we would still appreciate it if you would be able to take this survey so that we can understand how you perceive the performance of this snapshot.

It should also be noted that there is currently no upgrade path for existing worlds in this snapshot. This means that you can only create new worlds in this snapshot, and not play on any of your existing worlds. We're working on this and you should be able to play on your existing worlds in an upcoming snapshot not too far in the future.

All of this said, we hope that you have a great time checking out these new additions. Watch your feet so that you don't fall into a very deep hole, and make sure you don't get punted off a mountain by a goat that's just minding its own business.

Happy mining!

## New Features in 21w37a

-   Added noise caves and aquifers
-   Added Dripstone Caves underground biome
-   Added Grove biome
-   Added Lofty peaks biome
-   Added Lush Caves underground biome
-   Added Meadow biome
-   Added Snowcapped peaks biome
-   Added Snowy slopes biome
-   Added Stony peaks biome
-   New ore distribution and large ore veins
-   Overworld build and generation limits have been expanded

### Blocks

-   Enchanting Tables now emit a low amount of light
-   Using shears on the tip of a Cave Vine, Twisting Vine, Weeping Wine or Kelp now causes it to stop growing

### Dripstone Caves biome

-   Contains plenty of Pointed Dripstone and Dripstone Block on the floors and ceilings, and small pools of water
-   In some places you'll find larger stalagmites, stalactites, and columns built from Dripstone Blocks
-   Contains extra copper ore

### Grove

-   Snowy terrain with big spruce trees and powder snow traps. Might want to wear leather boots!
-   Tends to generate on high-altitude terrain beneath mountain peaks or on hilltops.
-   Spawns wolfs, rabbits, and foxes.

### Large ore veins

-   Ore veins are large, rare, snake-like underground ore formations
-   Copper veins form between y 0 and y 50 and are mixed with Granite
-   Iron veins form below y -60 and y -8 and are mixed with Tuff

### Lofty peaks

-   Dramatic jagged mountain peaks with snow and stone
-   Spawns goats

### Lush Caves biome

-   Moss covers the floors and ceilings
-   Spore Blossoms grow from the ceiling and drip particles
-   Contains Clay pools with Dripleaf plants growing out of them
-   Contains Azalea Bushes and Flowering Azalea Bushes
-   The Azalea Tree loves to have its roots in Lush Caves, so if you find an Azalea Tree (either overground or in a cave) you know there is a Lush Cave beneath you
-   Cave Vines with Glow Berries grow from the ceiling and light up the caves

### Meadow biome

-   Large grassy and flowery biome that tends to generate high up on plateaus or next to large mountain ranges.
-   Sometimes contains a lone tall oak or birch tree, often with a bee nest.
-   Think Sound of Music!
-   Spawns donkeys, rabbits, and sheep.

### Mob Spawning

-   Monsters now only spawn in places where the light from blocks is 0 (sky light still prevents spawning like before)
-   Fixed an issue where players in multiplayer can face more or far fewer enemies than intended, particularly when other players are flying

### New ore distribution

-   Changed ore generation to match the new world height, and to add more strategy to mining.
-   There is no longer a single y level that is best for all ores, you need to make tradeoffs.
-   Iron ore generates below y 72, with a strong bias towards y 16.
-   Iron ore also generates above 112, with more iron ore as you go higher.
-   Copper ore generates between y 0 and y 96, with a strong bias towards y 48.
-   Copper ore generates in larger amounts in dripstone caves biome.
-   Lapis lazuli generates below y 64, with a strong bias towards y 0. However, Lapis below y -32 or above y 32 cannot generate exposed to air. It will either be buried or inside water.
-   Coal generates above y 0, with a strong bias towards y 96 and above.
-   Coal has reduced air exposure, so you will find more coal buried or underwater than exposed to air.
-   Gold generates below y 32, with a strong bias towards y -16.
-   Extra gold can (still) be found in badlands biomes.
-   Redstone ore generates below y 16. Redstone ore generation gradually increases as you go below y -32 and further down.
-   Diamond generates below y 16, with more diamond the lower you go.
-   Diamonds have reduced air exposure, so you will find more diamond buried or underwater than exposed to air.

### Noise caves and Aquifers

-   Noise caves are a new way of generating caves, providing more natural variety. They can get really huge sometimes! Noise caves come in three flavors:
    -   Cheese caves. Like the holes in swiss cheese. These often form caverns of various size
    -   Spaghetti caves. Long squiggly tunnels, sometimes wide like tagliatelle
    -   Noodle caves. Thinner, squigglier, and more claustrophobic variant of spaghetti caves
-   No, they aren't loud. The "noise" part of noise caves is a technical term and has nothing to do with sound
-   The old cave carvers and canyons still generate, combining with the noise caves to form interesting cave systems
-   As with carvers, when noise caves intersect the surface they form cave entrances
-   An aquifer is an area with local water level, independent of sea level. Aquifers are used during world generation to generate bodies of water inside noise caves. This sometimes results in large underground lakes! They can also form inside mountains and on the surface.
-   Aquifers below y0 will sometimes be lava aquifers instead of water aquifers
-   Magma Blocks sometimes generates at the bottom of underground bodies of water
-   Underwater cave carvers and underwater canyons have been removed, since aquifers are used to generate water in caves instead

### Options

-   Added an accessibility option to stop the sky flashing during thunderstorms
-   Added an option to specify the audio device used by the game
-   Added "Toggle Sprint" and "Toggle Sneak" to the Controls settings
-   Moved Keybinds out to their own settings screen, accessible from Controls

### Snowcapped peaks

-   Smooth mountain peaks with ice and snow
-   Spawns goats and yeti. No actually just goats.

### Snowy slopes

-   Very snowy terrain that can hide powder snow traps. Might want to wear leather boots!
-   Tends to generate on high-altitude terrain beneath mountain peaks or on hilltops.
-   Spawns rabbits and goats.

### Stony peaks

-   Stony mountain peaks that may be jagged or smooth
-   Spawns goats
-   Contains strips of calcite sometimes

### World generation

-   Generation range and build limits have been expanded by 64 blocks up and 64 blocks down, to a total range of 384 blocks
-   Underground features, structures, and caves generate all the way down to y-64
-   Exception: Diorite and Granite and Andesite and Dirt don't generate below y0
-   Tweaked size and positioning of Diorite, Andesite & Granite generation
-   Dripstone clusters can no longer be found in normal caves, only in dripstone caves biome
-   Starting from y0 and below deepslate gradually replaces all stone
-   Deepslate blobs no longer generate above y0
-   The terrain shape and elevation varies dramatically, indepedently from biomes. For example, forests and deserts could form up on a hill without needing a special biome just for that
-   Less diorite/granite/andesite generates above y 60
-   Strips of gravel can generate in stony shores
-   Swamp trees can grow in water 2 blocks deep (instead of just 1 block deep)

## Changes in 21w37a

-   Illagers (Vindicator, Pillager, Evoker) no longer attack baby villagers
-   Axolotls now only spawn in lush caves
-   Axolotls now have their own, separate, mob cap
-   Raised the cloud level from 128 to 192

## Technical Changes in 21w37a

-   Replaced the clientbound chunk update network packet with another one which additionally contains light update data. Separate light update packet still exists and is sent when light update happens without chunk update.
-   View distance now causes chunks to load cylindrically around players instead of in a square
-   Information about the world generation noise is now displayed on the debug screen
-   Added `illageralt`, rune-like font from Minecraft Dungeons (currently only usable via commands)
-   Added startup option `--jfrProfile` and command `jfr` to start profiling with Java FlightRecorder as well as a few custom events.
-   Loot table functions `set_contents` and `set_loot_table` now require `type` field with valid block entity type
-   Worlds last saved before Minecraft 1.2 ("pre-anvil") no longer can be opened directly
-   Data pack format has been increased to 8
-   New video setting "Priority updates".
-   Removed length limits for scoreboard, score holder and team names
-   Mob spawners can now override light checks for spawning

### JFR Profiling

#### Custom events

-   `minecraft.ServerTickTime`: sampling event exposing average server tick times at one second intervals
-   `minecraft.ChunkGeneration`: time taken to generate individual chunk stages
-   `minecraft.PacketRead | minecraft.PacketSent`: network traffic
-   `minecraft.WorldLoadFinishedEvent`: initial world loading duration

#### Ending a profiling run

The run will then be stopped either by:

-   shutting down the JVM
-   `jfr stop` in-game command
-   `jcmd` CLI tool

#### Overview

Java Flight Recorder ([https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/328](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/328)) is the internal JVM profiling tool bundled with the Java Runtime to analyze performance and runtime characteristics. It's a useful tool for exposing internal JVM performance metrics as well as custom metrics that can be monitored or analyzed using any stock Java profiler or monitoring agents.

#### Reports

A summary JSON report is written both to the log file and in the debug folder accompanied by a `.jfr` recording ready to be analyzed in i.e JMC [https://github.com/openjdk/jmc](https://github.com/openjdk/jmc) or any other profiler tool supporting the format.

#### Starting a profiling run

A profiling run can be started using any of the following alternatives:

-   `--jfrProfile` startup flag when starting a Minecraft server or client
-   `jfr start` in-game command
-   Regular Java CLI tools such as `jcmd`

### Loot tables

#### Changed functions

##### `set_contents`, `set_loot_table`

Added new mandatory field `type`. This type will be written into `BlockEntityTag.id`, to make sure this tag can be correctly migrated between versions

### Old world conversion

-   Worlds last saved before Minecraft 1.2 ("pre-anvil") now require conversion in a previous version of a game to be able to be opened
-   Conversion works best in versions 1.6.4 and before - worlds opened for the first time in later versions will have incorrect biome information

### Priority update setting

-   This setting determines which chunks sections are updated synchronously during a single frame.
-   The most conservative option "nearby" corresponds to the state before the update.
-   The new options "by player" and "none" significantly reduce stutters when placing or removing blocks (especially light sources), but can potentially cause rare visually noticeable delays in world updates.

### Spawner data changes

-   Spawners now support the `custom_spawn_rules` NBT in the `SpawnData` field and the `SpawnPotentials` list
-   `custom_spawn_rules` currently may contain fields `block_light_limit` and `sky_light_limit` - both are integer ranges with fields `min_inclusive` and `max_inclusive`
-   To make `SpawnPotentials` format similar to other weighted lists, structure was changed to `{weight: <int>, data: <previous contents without 'Weight', 'Entity' renamed to 'entity'>}`
-   To accomodate that change, previous contents of `SpawnData` were moved to `SpawnData.entity` (making format of that field same as elements of `SpawnPotentials.data`)

Example:

    SpawnData: {
        entity: {
            id: "minecraft:cow"
        },
        custom_spawn_rules: {
              sky_light_limit: {min_inclusive: 10, max_inclusive: 15}
        },
    }
    SpawnPotentials: [
      {

### Advancements

#### New triggers

##### `started_riding`

-   Triggered when player starts riding a vehicle or entity starts riding vehicle currently ridden by player
-   Conditions:
    -   `player` - either a player that started riding or one of boat passengers

##### `lightning_strike`

-   Triggered when lighting finishes (i.e. entity disappears)
-   Triggers for any player on server
-   Conditions
    -   `player` - player for which this trigger runs
    -   `lightning` - predicate for lightning entity
    -   `bystander` - predicate for one of the entities in certain area around strike not hurt by it

##### `using_item`

-   Triggered for every tick of using items (like crossbows, spyglass, fishing rods, etc)
-   Conditions
    -   `player` - players that uses item
    -   `item` - item being used

#### Changed triggers

##### `effects_changed`

-   Added `source` triggers that matches entity that triggered the change
-   Might be empty when:
    -   there is no entity (for example, effect gained from beacon)
    -   the effect is self-applied
    -   effect is removed

-   `stepping_on` - location predicate for block entity is currently standing on
-   `lightning_bolt` - sub-predicate valid only for lightning bolt entity

##### Player predicate

-   `looking_at` - entity currently viewed by player
    -   uses same line-of-sight rules as attacking mobs
    -   actual detection radius might be changed in future

#### Lightning bolt

-   `blocks_set_on_fire` - range check for of blocks set on fire by this entity
-   `entity_struck` - predicate for entities struck by this lightning (if present, must match one or more)

### Performance metrics reporting

These will be saved to a zip file in `debug/profiling/<yyyy-MM-dd_HH.mm.ss-[levelname]-[version]>.zip` and could be used for performance regression analysis if included in bug reports.

The exact metrics, output format, and names are susceptible to change between versions. Our plan is to continue iterating on which metrics to capture.

#### Client F3+L shortcut

Pressing F3+L while in the game will start a recording for 10 seconds capturing metrics such as tick durations, used heap sizes and other more detailed stats.

Pressing F3+L before the 10-second limit will end the recording early.

This shortcut is always available to clients, even on multi-player servers where it will record client-side performance.

#### Dedicated Server perf start/stop command

`perf start` will start a recording for 10 seconds capturing metrics such as tick durations, used heap sizes and other more detailed stats.

`perf stop` before the 10-second limit will end the recording early.

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w19a

Now with twice as much Java version.

Starting with this snapshot, Candles, Bundles, and Sculk Sensors are only accessible through commands. We do not feel that they are at the quality we want for Part 1 of the Caves & Cliffs release. To keep trying these features out in survival mode, use the Preview data pack!

## Changes in 21w19a

-   The maximum length of item names in the anvil UI has been increased from 35 to 50
-   Made geodes significantly rarer
-   Unfinished items (Sculk Sensor, Bundle and Candles) have been removed from the creative inventory
-   Recipes for unfinished items (Bundle, Candles) have been removed

## Changes to the Caves & Cliffs Preview

Download the [updated datapack](https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/a6b56d6f14869646eb8d399e99a0149bdd954490/CavesAndCliffsPreview.zip).

-   The pack now includes recipes related to bundles and candles

## Technical changes in 21w19a

-   Upgraded to Java 16
-   Added `mineable/axe`, `mineable/hoe`, `mineable/pickaxe` and `mineable/shovel` block tags. Blocks with these tags can be destroyed more quickly with the matching tool.
-   Added `needs_stone_tool`, `needs_iron_tool` and `needs_diamond_tool` block tags. If a block requires the correct tool to drop, these tags determine which tier of that tool is required.
-   Changed the syntax of the `/item` command

### Java 16

Minecraft now uses a more recent version of Java. If you are using a default setup the Launcher will download and install the correct version. If you are using a custom Java setup or a third-party launcher, you will need to ensure that your Java installation is version 16 or above.

### Item command

New syntax:

-   `/item replace <target> with <item stack> [<count>]` - same as old `replaceitem`
-   `/item replace <target> from <source> [<modifier>]` - copies item for source to target(s), optionally applying modifier
-   `/item modify <target> <modifier>` - modifies item (without copying)

For example, `/item replace block ~ ~ ~ container.0 from entity @s enderchest.0` will copy first item from player's enderchest to first slot of container player is currently standing on.

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w18a

Hey-hoo! Will you look at that! It's Wednesday once again, which means we get to share updates about all the Minecraft bits and bobs. This week, we're distributing an ore distribution Snapshot for all you lovely Snapshot connoisseurs to feast upon. Enjoy!

## Changes in 21w18a

-   Infested Blocks are no longer instantly destroyed, and instead have half the destroy time of their non-infested counterpart.
-   Screaming goats will use their ram attack more often than other goats will

## Changes to the Caves & Cliffs Preview

[Click here](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/snapshot21w18aoresdistributionfull.jpg) for a link to the full resolution image.

-   Reduced copper spawning a bit, to compensate for large ore veins
-   Large ore veins are slightly more rare and slightly smaller on average. But the size varies a lot so you can still find huge ones.
-   Increased chance of finding raw ore blocks in ore veins
-   Cave carvers generate below y 0 in ocean biomes (they didn't before, it was an accident)
-   Increased the minimum size of noodle caves and carvers, to make them easier to traverse and less likely to break up into fragments.
-   Noodle caves no longer generate above y 30, so the surface should be less riddled with holes.
-   Removed deepslate blobs above y 0
-   Extended the vertical range of the smaller blobs of iron ore, to make it possible to find iron in caves near the surface.
-   Slightly reduced the amount of normal-sized iron blobs, to compensate for large ore veins and the increased range of smaller blobs.

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w16a

Snapshot 21w16a introduces some changes to azaleas and dripstone. On top of that, we've tweaked the textures of raw ores. There are also a few additions to the Caves & Cliffs preview datapack.

## New Features in 21w16a

-   Azalea and Flowering Azalea can now be bonemealed to get an Azalea Trees
-   Added dripstone growth

### Dripstone growth

-   If a stalactite is hanging from a dripstone block with a water source above, it will slowly grow both the stalactite from above and a stalagmite from below
-   Growth speed is random but very slow, a single growth step can take several minecraft days
-   A stalactite will only grow up to 7 blocks long
-   A stalactite will only cause stalagmite growth if the floor or stalagmite below is within 10 blocks
-   If the stalactite tip is inside water it won't drip, and therefore won't trigger any growth
-   If the stalagmite tip is inside water it won't receive drops, and therefore won't be grown by a dripping stalactite. Same thing if there is any fluid between the two tips
-   A stalagmite or stalactite will never grow into a fluid

## Changes in 21w16a

-   Tweaked the texture of raw ores and raw ore blocks

-   Aquifers below height 0 will sometimes be lava aquifers instead of water aquifers
-   Ore veins can now spawn underground

### Ore veins

-   Ore veins are large, rare, snake-like underground ore formations
-   Copper veins form above height 0 and are mixed with granite
-   Iron veins form below height 0 and are mixed with tuff

## Technical Changes in 21w16a

-   Users who previously permanently declined server resource packs will now still be shown the pack prompt if the pack is mandatory (instead of being immediately disconnected)
-   The statistic for play time has been renamed to `play_time`
-   There is now a statistic for "Time with World Open" (`total_world_time`) that also includes time when the game was paused

## Bugs fixed in 21w16a

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w15a

In today’s snapshot, we’re making a few needed changes that directly relate to our [recent announcement](https://www.minecraft.net/article/a-caves---cliffs-announcement). If you haven’t yet read it, we strongly recommend you do. You can also check out [this Caves & Cliffs video](https://youtu.be/6YgKUZnUyak) from Agnes and Henrik to learn more about our plans for the update.

Even though some features will be released later than we’d planned, you can still try them out through a separate data pack. More information, as well as our latest tweaks, can be found here below.

## Caves & Cliffs World Generation

The riskier and technically more complex world generation changes for the Caves & Cliffs update will be shipped in a later update and have been switched off in this snapshot. This means:

-   World height has been switched back to the 1.16 levels
-   Noise caves and aquifers have been switched off
-   Cave and ravine carvers have been returned to their old settings
-   Crack carvers have been switched off
-   Ore distribution has been returned to the 1.16 setup
-   Copper now generates between the bottom of the world and height 192, being most common around height 96
-   Tuff now generates in blobs between heights 0 and 16
-   Worlds created in snapshot 21w05b or any earlier version can now once again be opened
-   Worlds created in any version between snapshot 21w06a and 21w14a can no longer be opened

### The Caves & Cliffs Prototype Data Pack

You can still try out the world generation for the later update using a datapack which activates the changes as an experimental custom world:

-   [Download the data pack](https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/643b1f8f7f71c74ffc913e8572f52fd5bca88282/CavesAndCliffsPreview.zip)
-   Launch the game, go to the "Create New World" screen, and click the “Data Packs” button
-   Drag the downloaded zip file onto the Minecraft window
-   The game will ask you if you want to add the data pack – click “Yes”
-   Click the play arrow on the data pack that just appeared in the list – this will move it to the list on the right-hand side of the screen
-   Click the "Done" button and continue creating your world as normal

Keep in mind that the world you create with the data pack will be flagged as experimental by the game, and such worlds are not guaranteed to work in future versions. Also, please note that you can’t add data packs that change the world generation to existing worlds, so you must create a new world to access the experimental features.

## New Features in 21w15a

-   Goats will ram anything that moves... and also armor stands

## Changes in 21w15a

-   A crinkly, crunchy sound now plays when Bone Meal is used
-   Reordered some blocks in the Building Blocks Tab in Creative Menu
-   Goats will avoid walking on powder snow
-   Creepers know not to mess with goats
-   The main menu background has been updated
-   Tweaked the textures of raw ore items
-   Just like other ore materials, you can craft a compact version with raw ore items in order to save inventory space

![Minecraft Snapshot 21w15a Texture Comparison](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/images/snapshot-21w15a-ore-texture-comparison.png) New raw ore textures in snapshot 21w15a. [Click here](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/snapshot21w15aoretexturecomparisonfull.png) for a link to the full resolution image.

### Building Blocks tab

-   All ores have been reordered to be in the same location in the creative inventory.
-   Compact forms of raw and refined underground materials have been reordered.

## Technical Changes in 21w15a

-   Added the Marker entity
-   Added `/debug function`
-   `selector` and `nbt` chat components can now configure separators between elements
-   Servers can now customize a message to display when prompting players about custom resource packs

### Markers

Markers are a new type of entity meant for custom use cases like map making and data packs.

-   Only exist on the server side, are never sent to clients
-   Do not do any updates of their own
-   Have a `data` compound field that can contain any data

### `/debug function`

New debug subcommand executes command with same syntax as function

-   Every executed command, message (even if it would be normally invisible), result or error is stored to file
-   Cannot be run from inside functions

### Chat component separators

-   Components that print lists of names, like `selector` or `nbt` can now override separator (`", "` by default) with `separator` element
-   Examples:
    -   `{"selector": "@e[type=chicken]", "separator": "|"}`
    -   `{"nbt": "CustomName", "entity": "@e[type=chicken]", "interpret": true, "separator": {"text": "*", "color": "red"}}`

### Custom server resource packs

When `require-resource-pack` is used in `server.properties`, there's now an option for servers to add a custom message.

-   A dedicated server can configure additional message to be shown on resource pack prompt (`resource-pack-prompt` in `server.properties`, expects chat component syntax, can contain multiple lines)

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w14a

A new snapshot is ready to be served, although somewhat… raw. Gordon Ramsey would be furious. Please don’t tell him, we don’t want to be called donuts. :(

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w11a

An absolutely shocking snapshot arrives! This snapshot adds some new functionality to Copper, some general tweaks, a fancy new way of getting performance metrics, and a bunch of bugfixes.

Happy mining!

## New Features in 21w11a

-   Lightning rods can now, for the very first time ever, be waterlogged
-   New functionality for applying and removing wax from copper
-   Bonemealing rooted dirt now grows hanging roots underneath

### Waxing Copper and Oxidization

-   Right click with honeycomb on copper blocks to wax them
-   Use honeycomb in a dispenser to wax copper blocks
-   Axes can scrape off wax and oxidation of copper blocks
-   Lightning strike hitting copper will clean its oxidation

## Changes in 21w11a

-   Waxed copper blocks can be crafted into 4 copper ingots
-   Tweaked the cave sizes
-   Slightly increased the frequency of diamond ore blobs
-   Hanging roots block now renders randomly offset
-   Breaking a Big Dripleaf stem now drops a Big Dripleaf block
-   Moss blocks can be crafted with cobblestone or stone bricks to make the mossy versions of those blocks
-   The facing direction of Small Dripleaf blocks is now determined by which direction the player is facing when placing it
-   Fully-grown Amethyst Clusters now drop 4 Amethyst Shards (or more with Fortune) when mined with a pickaxe, and drop 2 Amethyst Shards when broken by hand, piston, or other means

## Technical Changes in 21w11a

-   Added F3+L shortcut to generate and persist performance metrics from in-game

### In-game client metrics reporting

Pressing F3+L while in the game will start a recording for 10 seconds capturing metrics such as tick durations, used heap sizes and other more detailed stats. These will be saved to a zip file in `debug/profiling/<yyyy-MM-dd_HH.mm.ss>.zip` and could be used for performance regression analysis if included in bug reports.

The exact metrics, output format and names are susceptible to change between versions, and our plan is to continue iterating on which metrics to capture.

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w10a

A truly fabulous snapshot enters the arena! This snapshot brings fundamental changes to our rendering pipeline with the introduction of the brand new tech that is OpenGL Core 3.2. On top of that, we're finally introducing the Lush Caves biome. However, as with the Dripstone Caves, this is only available through creating a custom world.

There's an important note about this snapshot for those of you with older computers: With the introduction of OpenGL Core 3.2 there is a chance Minecraft Java will no longer run on computers that do not meet the [minimum system requirements](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360035131371-Minecraft-Java-Edition-system-requirements-). Computers that meet the [minimum system requirements](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360035131371-Minecraft-Java-Edition-system-requirements-) should not be affected.

## New Features in 21w10a

-   Added Lush Caves underground biome!
-   Added Cracked Deepslate Bricks and Cracked Deepslate Tiles
-   There is now an Infested variant of Deepslate found in the underground
-   While they will not generate in the world by default, Deepslate versions of copper, emerald and coal ores have been added for use by creators of maps and data packs

### Lush caves biome

The Lush Caves underground biome now exists for use in single-biome worlds. It does not yet generate in other world types.

-   Moss covers the floors and ceilings
-   Spore Blossoms grow from the ceiling and drip particles
-   Contains clay pools with dripleaf plants grow out of them
-   Contains azalea bushes and flowering azalea bushes
-   The azalea tree loves to have its roots in lush caves, so if you find an azalea tree (either overground or in a cave) you know there is a lush cave beneath you
-   Cave vines with glow berries grow from the ceiling and light up the caves

## Changes in 21w10a

-   Cobbled Deepslate can now be smelted into Deepslate.
-   Deepslate can now be placed along any axis
-   Lightning rods can now be waterlogged
-   Fossils in the deepest part of the underground generate with deepslate diamond ore instead of coal ore
-   Some ore textures have been updated

### Ore distribution

Overworld ore generation has been tweaked.

-   More emeralds in mountains
-   More lapis
-   Less copper, gold, and redstone
-   Smaller diamond blobs, but slightly more frequent. Less diamond ore overall though
-   Less iron, and it generates lower down
-   Reduced air exposure for coal

## Technical Changes in 21w10a

-   The game now runs using OpenGL 3.2 core profile
-   The maximum size that slimes can be summoned with is now 128
-   The `give` command can only give up to 100 stacks of items at a time (e.g. 6400 stone or 100 iron swords)

### OpenGL

Rendering is now using OpenGL 3.2 core profile. All fixed function rendering has been replaced with shader based rendering.

#### Shaders

Shaders are now included for all supported render states. Any shader except for the `blit` shader can also be replaced in resource packs. For now replacing these shaders is **not officially supported** and the way it works may change in the future.

The current rendering engine uses a system similar to the post processing shader pipeline. There are some differences between both system that cater to the slightly different requirements.

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w06a

Hello, new snapshot! Hello, new cave generation!

Today's snapshot introduces a major change to how caves are generated within Minecraft. You could say that we're now introducing the cave part of Caves & Cliffs.

This is only the first step in our underground adventure, so please note that snapshots show features in early development and that there are two notable caveats with this snapshot:

-   You'll be unable to open old worlds in this snapshot as there is currently no upgrade path towards the new world height
-   All caves of the new type between y31 and y63 will be flooded with water

## New Features in 21w06a

-   Added noise caves and aquifers

### Noise caves and Aquifers

-   Noise caves are a new way of generating caves, providing more natural variety. They can get really huge sometimes! Noise caves come in two flavors:
    -   Cheese caves. Like the holes in swiss cheese. These often form caverns of various size.
    -   Spaghetti caves. Long squiggly tunnels, sometimes wide like tagliatelle.
-   No, they aren't loud. The "noise" part of noise caves is a technical term and has nothing to do with sound.
-   The old cave carvers and canyons still generate, combining with the noise caves to form interesting cave systems.
-   As with carvers, when noise caves intersect the surface they form cave entrances.
-   An aquifer is an area with local water level, independent of sea level. Aquifers are used during world generation to generate bodies of water inside noise caves. This sometimes results in large underground lakes!
-   For now, aquifers are only used below y31. This means all noise caves between y31 and sea level (y63) will be flooded with water, and noise cave entrances will essentially be lakes. This will be fixed later.
-   Magma sometimes generates at the bottom of underground bodies of water
-   Underwater cave carvers and underwater canyons have been removed, since aquifers are used to generate water in caves instead.

## Changes in 21w06a

-   Overworld build and generation limits have been expanded
-   Mineshafts adapted to larger caves
-   You can no longer crouch or jump to prevent a big dripleaf from tilting
-   A big dripleaf will now tilt rather than break when hit by a projectile
-   A redstone powered big dripleaf will not tilt (except when hit by a projectile)
-   The textures for hanging roots and small dripleaves have been updated

### World generation

-   Generation range and build limits have been expanded by 64 blocks up and 64 blocks down, to a total range of 384 blocks
-   Underground features, structures, and caves generate all the way down to y -64.

### Mineshaft changes

-   Mineshaft pieces don't generate if they would be fully floating in the air
-   Mineshaft corridors are supported by log pillars when needed
-   No floating cobwebs

## Fixed bugs in 21w06a

-   [MC-214346](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-214346) Big dripleaf can be broken with arrows in spawn protection
-   [MC-213813](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-213813) Small dripleaf can destroy any block

---

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w05b

Snapshot 21w05b is a small snapshot to address a couple of bugs.

## Fixed bugs in 21w05b

-   [MC-203813](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-203813) Copper blocks are named inconsistently
-   [MC-213788](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-213788) The game can randomly freeze

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w05a

## New Features in 21w05a

-   Azalea bushes as well as flowering azaela bushes!
-   Added cave vines and glow berries!
-   Added drip leaves!
-   Added decorative blocks for the upcoming lush caves: hanging roots and rooted dirt!
-   Added moss!
-   Added spore blossom!

### Cave vines and glow berries

-   Cave vines grow down from the ceiling, like weeping vines
-   When they grow they have a chance of producing glow berries
-   Glow berries are a natural light source as well as a food source
-   Foxes eat glow berries
-   Use glow berries to plant new cave vines
-   Bonemealing a cave vine will create glow berries

### Dripleaf

-   Small dripleaf needs moisture, so it grows on clay or underwater
-   Small dripleaf grow into big dripleaf when bonemealed.
-   Big dripleaf grows taller when bonemealed
-   If you stand on a big dripleaf it will tilt after a while and you will fall off
-   You can crouch or jump to prevent a big dripleaf from tilting
-   A tilted big drip leaf will tilt up again after a while
-   The big dripleaf will break when hit by a projectile
-   The wandering trader will sometimes sell small dripleaf plants

### Moss

-   Two new decorative blocks: Moss block and moss carpet
-   Moss carpet can be crafted from moss blocks

### Spore blossom

-   A beautiful large flower placed on ceilings
-   Particles drip from it

## Changes in 21w05a

-   The stonecutter can be used to craft the different copper block variants
-   The stages of copper oxidization are now called "Copper Block", "Exposed Copper Block", "Weathered Copper Block" and "Oxidized Copper Block" in sequence of least to most oxidized
-   Drowned now have a chance of dropping a copper ingot, they no longer drop gold ingots
-   Added new sculk sensor events
-   Changes to powder snow

### Sculk Sensor Changes

Added the following game events that the Sculk Sensor reacts to, along with corresponding frequency value:

Vibration Types

Frequency Value

Minecart Moving, Ring Bell, Block Change

6

Drinking Finish, Prime Fuse

7

Mob Interact

8

Equip, Shear, Ravager Roar

9

Entity Place

12

13

Shulker Close

14

Shulker Open

15

-   `Block Change` is for when player or dispenser action has changed a block. Example: cake slice being eaten.
-   `Mob Interact` is for specific mob interaction events that cause vibrations.
-   `Prime Fuse` is for both TNT and Creepers.

### Powder Snow changes

-   Flaming arrows now get extinguished when they collide with Powder Snow
-   Skeletons now convert to Strays when frozen
-   Powder snow is now pushable by pistons and sticky pistons
-   Foxes can now walk on top of powder snow without falling in

## Technical Changes in 21w05a

-   Improved performance when using many overrides on an item model
-   Copper oxidization is now a random tick effect and thus affected by the randomTickSpeed game rule

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w03a

Today's Caves & Cliffs snapshot is particularly shiny! You could almost say it's glowing... Oh wait, that's a squid.

## New Features in 21w03a

​

-   Added Glow Lichen!
-   Added the Glow Squid!

​

### Glow Lichen

-   A dim light source that generates in caves
-   Use shears to pick it up
-   Use bonemeal to spread it along block surfaces

​

### Glow Squid

Glow squids have been added, but do not yet spawn naturally. You can find spawn eggs for them in the creative inventory.

-   Glow Squids are well-lit and can be seen from even far distances!
-   When killed, Glow Squids drop Glow Ink Sacs
-   Glow Ink Sacs can be used on signs to make the text super visible, even at night! Works with colors!
-   Craft a Glow Item Frame by combining a Glow Ink Sac with an Item Frame in a Crafting Table. Any item in a Glow Item Frame is perfectly illuminated, even at night!
-   Use an Ink Sac on a sign to remove the glow effect
-   Axolotls will attack any Glow Squids they see, so...be careful

​

# Minecraft 1.16.5 Release Candidate 1

We're now releasing 1.16.5 Release Candidate 1, which addresses two critical stability issues. If no further critical issues are found, we plan to release 1.16.5 on Friday. We hope to release another Caves & Cliffs snapshot next week.

Happy mining!

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w51a

Ready your screenshot buttons and start rehearsing your best "naaaaww"s. The final snapshot of the year enters Minecraft Java, and what better way to end the year than with something that has been on our bucket list for quite a while: the adorable **axolotl**?

We hope you'll end the year on a good note, and the entirety of the Java team wishes you happy holidays.

## New Features in 20w51a

​

-   Added the axolotl!

​

### Axolotl

-   Amphibious!
-   Axolotls currently love tropical fish, though this may change. Tropical fish or tropical fish buckets can be used to mate axolotls
-   Axolotls will swim around with you if you're holding a tropical fish or tropical fish bucket in one of your hands
-   When a player kills a mob that the axolotl was attacking or being attacked by, the axolotl will show its appreciation by granting the player temporary regeneration and removing any mining fatigue effects
-   You can pick up your axolotl in a water bucket and carry it around just like a salmon or cod!
-   Axolotls will always chase after squids and other types of fish
-   Axolotls are skittish, but they will attack Drowned and Guardians if you tempt them with their favorite food - tropical fish!
-   Axolotls do not like it out of water, and will dry up and begin taking damage if they are out of water for longer than 5 minutes
-   An axolotl will not dry up as long as they are in water or rain
-   Sometimes when an axolotl takes damage, it will pretend to be dead so that it stops being attacked
-   There are 4 common varieties and 1 rare variety of axolotl
-   Axolotls do not spawn in the world yet, but you can find spawn eggs for them in the creative inventory

​

## Changes in 20w51a

-   Bundles and shulker box items will now drop their items when destroyed
-   Some changes have been made to Sculk Sensors

​

### Sculk Sensors

-   Eating Start has been removed as an event for a few reasons.
    -   It is inconsistent with our philosophy around vibrations. Mining a block is not considered a vibration because a physical event hasn't happened in the world yet (you can stop mining and the block will revert). This is the same for eating: you can start eating, but then stop and the food reverts as if eating never occurred.
    -   It wasn't widely considered to be a useful event for players to use Sculk Sensors with.
    -   Eating Finish is staying, and will likely be much more useful to Sculk Sensors for this scenario.
-   Walking on wool no longer causes vibrations.
-   Throwing wool as an item onto the ground no longer causes vibrations.
-   Sculk Sensors are now silent while waterlogged.

​

#### Vibration Frequency Changes

As we continue to consider feedback from the community, some changes to the frequency ranges have been made. We expect this to change quite heavily up until release to figure out the most interesting ranges for gameplay, and as always feedback is extremely welcome! Here is the newest table in this snapshot.

## Technical Changes in 20w51a

-   Added gamerule playersSleepingPercentage (100 by default), which sets what percentage of players must sleep to skip the night. Setting to 0 will mean 1 player is always enough to skip the night. Setting above 100 will prevent skipping the night.

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w49a

Another snapshot is going out, and this one introduces the Sculk. They're a bit creepy, but don't let that put you off. Pick up some good vibrations!

## New Features in 20w49a

-   Added Dripstone Caves biome
-   Added Sculk Sensors

### Dripstone Caves biome

This biome doesn't generate naturally yet, since it is designed for the upcoming larger caves. However, if you want to see the biome in the current caves you can create a single-biome world with dripstone caves.

-   Contains plenty of Pointed Dripstone on the floors and ceilings, and small pools of water
-   In some places you'll find larger stalagmites, stalactites, and columns built from Dripstone Blocks.

### Sculk Sensors

-   Introducing the bizarre, tendril-filled world of Sculk - prepare for Sculk Sensors to creep you out with their unique ability to detect vibrations nearby.
-   A vibration is anything that causes physical motion; if you are careful, there are some motions that are undetectable to sensors by sneaking.
    -   These sneak-friendly vibrations currently include walking, falling to the ground or throwing/shooting projectiles.
-   Sculk Sensors will not listen to vibrations that are directly created by other Sculk sources.
-   When a vibration is detected, a signal is sent from the source location to the sensor at a speed of 1 game tick per block.
    -   Other vibrations cannot be detected by a sensor when a signal is already travelling to it.
    -   When the signal has arrived, the sensor will be activated for 40 game ticks (approximately 2 seconds).
    -   While activated, the sensor cannot detect other vibrations.
-   Sculk Sensors can detect vibrations in an 8 block radius around it.
-   The efficient tool to mine Sculk Sensors is the Hoe.
-   They can be waterlogged.

#### Redstone Emission

-   Sculk Sensors emit a redstone signal when they are activated.
-   The strength of the redstone signal is inversely proportional to the distance the vibration signal travelled.
    -   This means that the closer the vibration is, the stronger the redstone signal is.
    -   The output is also scaled based on the Sculk Sensor's radius, so it can reach the max redstone signal strength when the vibration is 0 distance away (directly on top of the sensor).

#### Vibration Frequencies

-   Sculk Sensors have a unique interaction with comparators.
-   Each vibration in the game falls under a certain frequency value, and this value can be measured with a comparator.
-   With the right contraption, this allows you to detect when a certain action has occured nearby.

#### Wool Occlusion

-   Wool has a special interaction with Sculk Sensors.
-   If a wool block is in the way of a vibration source, the sensor will not be able to detect it.

#### Technical Tidbits

-   Sculk Sensors have a cooldown period of 1 tick after being placed or after deactivating.
-   During this short cooldown period, it cannot detect vibrations. This is to prevent it from activating itself when a contraption it is powering is being unpowered. Feedback is welcome on this point!

## Changes in 20w49a

-   The Fullness of a bundle now shows up regardless of whether Advanced Tooltips are on or off
-   Stalactites and stalagmites merge if the tips are next to each other, unless you press shift while placing

-   A new game event system has been implemented to support Sculk Sensors detecting vibrations.
-   World height related values are now exposed for customized worlds
-   Removed the `max-build-height` server setting
-   Added `occludes_vibration_signals` block tag. Anything in this tag will occlude vibrations, and inherits `wool` tag entries by default
-   New particle types: `vibration` and `dust_color_transition`
-   A new game event system has been implemented to support Sculk Sensors detecting vibrations.

### Game Events

This system has been developed to identify when certain in-world actions are happening in nearby chunks, particularly so the new Sculk Sensor can detect these events as vibrations.

The following is a list of the initial game events:

-   `minecraft:step`
-   `minecraft:swim`
-   `minecraft:flap`
-   `minecraft:elytra_free_fall`
-   `minecraft:hit_ground`
-   `minecraft:splash`
-   `minecraft:projectile_shoot`
-   `minecraft:projectile_land`
-   `minecraft:entity_hit`
-   `minecraft:block_place`
-   `minecraft:block_destroy`
-   `minecraft:fluid_place`
-   `minecraft:fluid_pickup`
-   `minecraft:block_open`
-   `minecraft:block_close`
-   `minecraft:block_switch`
-   `minecraft:block_unswitch`
-   `minecraft:block_attach`
-   `minecraft:block_detach`
-   `minecraft:block_press`
-   `minecraft:block_unpress`
-   `minecraft:container_open`
-   `minecraft:container_close`
-   `minecraft:explode`
-   `minecraft:armor_stand_add_item`
-   `minecraft:wolf_shaking`
-   `minecraft:dispense_fail`
-   `minecraft:fishing_rod_cast`
-   `minecraft:fishing_rod_reel_in`
-   `minecraft:piston_extend`
-   `minecraft:piston_contract`
-   `minecraft:flint_and_steel_use`
-   `minecraft:eating_start`
-   `minecraft:eating_finish`
-   `minecraft:lightning_strike`

#### Tags

There are also game event tags that come with this, and can be modified by data packs. They can be found under `data/minecraft/tags/game_events`.

-   `vibrations` Determines which game events are considered vibrations by the Sculk Sensor. Currently, all added game events are in this tag by default.
-   `ignore_vibrations_stepping_carefully` Which game events should be ignored by the Sculk Sensor when the source of the event is sneaking.

The following game events are in `ignore_vibrations_stepping_carefully` by default:

-   `minecraft:step`
-   `minecraft:hit_ground`
-   `minecraft:projectile_shoot`

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w46a

The snow is snowier than before.

For today’s snapshot, we’ve changed most of the textures introduced in the previous snapshot. This is simply to test if these textures give a better experience in exploring and building. We’re interested to hear what you think. Keep in mind, that some textures might be reverted or changed again in the future

## New Features in 20w46a

-   Added Powder Snow!

### Powder Snow

Snowier snow!

-   Powder Snow is a trap block that causes any entity that walks into it to sink in it
-   You can pick up and place Powder Snow with a bucket
-   Wear leather boots to prevent yourself from sinking into Powder Snow blocks
-   Leave a Cauldron outside in falling snow and it will fill with Powder Snow

#### Freezing

-   Standing in Powder Snow will slowly freeze an entity
-   Once frozen, freeze damage is done every few seconds to the frozen entity
-   Each piece of leather armor warn causes an entity to freeze more slowly
-   Wearing a full set of leather armor prevents freezing entirely

## Changes in 20w46a

-   The range in which a lightning rod attracts lightning has been doubled
-   Copper blocks are now crafted from 4 copper ingots
-   Sky color now varies smoothly when moving between different biomes
-   Buttons that change value (like `Difficulty`) can now be controlled with mouse wheel
-   Clicking on button that changes value while holding shift key changes to previous value
-   "Debug" world type can now be accessed while holding alt key (was shift)

### Textures

Changed a number of the textures for blocks and items introduced in the previous snapshot:

-   Cut Copper
-   Lightning Rod
-   Calcite
-   Amethyst Block
-   Budding Amethyst Block
-   Tinted Glass
-   Candle Item Icons
-   Copper Ingot Item Icon
-   Amethyst Shard Item Icon
-   Bundle Item Icon

## Technical Changes in 20w46a

-   Removed `/replaceitem` command
-   Added `/item` command
-   Added item modifiers, which reuse loot table functions syntax to describe item modification in `/item` command.
-   Data pack version is now 7
-   Loot tables can now access scoreboard values by UUID.
-   Loot table values inside random number generators can now be nested.
-   Default mode of structure blocks is now `Load`. `Data` is now hidden (but can be accessed by clicking mode button while holding alt key)

### Item modifiers

The function part of loot tables can now be defined as separate data pack resource in `item_modifiers` directory. Such files can contain a single function (i.e single JSON object) or an array of functions.

### Commands

#### `item`

Modifies item or block inventory.

This command has three forms:

-   `/item <target> replace <item stack> [<count>]` - same as old `replaceitem`
-   `/item <target> modify <modifier>` - modifies item (without copying).
-   `/item <target> copy <source> [<modifier>]` - copies item for source to target(s), optionally applying modifier

Possible sources and targets:

-   `entity <selector> <slot>`
-   `block <x> <y> <z> <slot>`

For example, `/item block ~ ~ ~ container.0 copy entity @s enderchest.0` will copy first item from player's enderchest to first slot of container player is currently standing on.

### Loot tables

#### New conditions

##### `value_check`

Checks range of value.

Parameters:

-   `value` - see "New value providers" section (currently combination of random generators and score)
-   `range` - min/max range

#### Changed conditions

##### `score`

`entity` parameter has now been replaced with `target`. It can either contain value from old `entity` field (like `this`) or be an score holder name in form `{"name": "..."}`.

#### Changed functions

##### `set_damage`

This function now has `add` parameter. If `true`, change will be relative to current damage. If `false`, damage will be replaced with current value (default behavior)

##### `set_count`

This function now has `add` parameter. If `true`, change will be relative to current item count. If `false`, item count will be replaced with current value (default behavior)

##### `copy_nbt`

`source` parameter can now be set to `{"storage": <namespaced id>}`, to access command storage.

#### New functions

##### `set_enchantments`

Modifies enchantments on item

###### Parameters

-   `enchantments` - map of enchantment id to level value (can be score or random number)
-   `add` - if `true`, change will be relative to current level. If `false`, level will be replaced with current value (default behavior)

#### New value providers

Note: value providers can be used in same places as random number generators.

##### `score`

Returns scaled scoreboard value.

###### Parameters

-   `score` - scoreboard name
-   `target` - same as `target` in `score` predicate
-   `scale` - scaling factor (float)

### Data Packs

Changes to data packs for version 7:

-   Removal of `/replaceitem` (replaced with `/item replace`)
-   `score` loot table condition: `entity` parameter has been replaced with `target`

## Resource Packs

Changes to resource packs for version 7:

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w45a

Good things come to those who wait, and we've believe you've waited long enough. The first Caves & Cliffs snapshot is finally here and ready to enter the Java Edition of Minecraft! We hope that you're as excited about this as we are, because this snapshot brings you a variety of features, some changes to existing features, and a few technical changes. All of it is listed in this blog post, and we can't wait to see you experiment with it all.

Happy mining!

## New Features in 20w45a

-   Added bundles!
-   Added candles!
-   Added lava cauldrons!
-   Added Copper!
-   Added Amethyst!
-   Added Lightning Rod!
-   Added the Spyglass!
-   Added Tinted Glass!
-   A Shulker hitting a Shulker with a Shulker Bullet can make a new Shulker.

### Amethysts

#### Amethyst Blocks

-   Amethyst comes in block form inside the geodes in two ways: Block of Amethyst and Budding Amethyst
-   All types of Amethyst blocks (clusters included) create beautiful sounds when you walk on them, break them, place them, or hit them with a projectile - go make some music!

#### Amethyst Clusters

-   Amethyst Clusters grow from Budding Amethyst, which can be found inside geodes
-   Clusters have 4 growth stages: Small Amethyst Bud, Medium Amethyst Bud, Large Amethyst Bud, and Amethyst Cluster
-   Clusters can only grow when they are placed on Budding Amethyst blocks
-   Fully-grown Amethyst Clusters drop 4 Amethyst Shards (or more with Fortune) when an Iron Pickaxe or higher is used, and drop nothing otherwise when broken
-   Clusters can be Silk Touched at any stage

#### Amethyst Geodes

-   These huge geodes can be found anywhere underground in the overworld
-   Amethyst geodes have an outer layer of a new stone called Tuff
-   Amethyst geodes have a second layer of another new block called Calcite
-   Amethyst geodes have an inner layer of various Amethyst blocks

#### Amethyst Shards

-   Amethyst Clusters drop 4 Amethyst Shards (or more with Fortune)

#### Budding Amethyst

-   On any side of a Budding Amethyst block where there is air, or a water source block, a Small Amethyst Bud will eventually grow
-   Amethyst Buds can only grow when attached to Budding Amethyst, and will grow until they become Amethyst Clusters

### Bundles

-   Bundles are items that hold other items.
-   A bundle can hold a mixture of items, but only one stack’s worth. For example, a bundle could fit:
    -   64 dirt
    -   32 dirt + 32 stone
    -   32 dirt + 8 ender pearls
    -   1 of every color of wool, concrete, carpet and terracotta (64 blocks in total)
    -   Or 1 diamond helmet
-   Use right click to put an item into a bundle.
-   Right-click a bundle to empty it.
-   Wrap a present in a bundle and give it to your friend!

### Candles

-   Candles come in all 16 colors + 1 uncolored variant
-   Up to 4 can be placed in one block
-   Candles allow you to properly wish someone a happy birthday
-   Waterloggable! (But you cannot light them underwater, silly)
-   Wish anybody a happy birthday with a candle cake!

### Cauldrons

-   Cauldrons can now be filled with buckets of lava!
-   Filled lava cauldrons give off a redstone signal of strength 1

### Copper

#### Copper blocks

-   Craft 9 copper ingots to a copper block
-   Craft cut copper, cut copper stairs and cut copper slabs
-   Use honeycomb to craft waxed copper blocks

#### Copper ore

-   Copper ore can be found in ore blobs across Overworld, similar to iron and coal (this is not the final generation for copper…)
-   Smelt copper ore to get a copper ingot

#### Lightning Rod

-   The Lightning Rod is crafted from three copper ingots
-   Keep your builds safe (well, as long as the closest area around the lightning rod is fire proof) during thunderstorms!
-   The lightning rod will protect an area of 4 \* 16 blocks around it from the, sometimes devastating, lightning strikes!
-   Lightning rods give off a redstone signal when struck by lightning

#### Oxidation

-   Copper will oxidize over time
-   There are for stages: copper, lightly weathered copper, semi-weathered copper and weathered copper
-   It takes 50 - 82 Minecraft days (in loaded chunks) for a copper block to oxidize one stage
-   Waxed copper blocks will not oxidize
-   You can wax any oxidation stage - how lovely that means you can keep that pretty lightly weathered copper block in it’s lightly weathered stage forever!

### Spyglass

-   You can use your spyglass to see faraway things
-   Pretend to be a sea captain, or catch your neighbor in the act as they dye your sheep lime green
-   The spyglass is crafted from two copper ingots and one amethyst shard

### Tinted Glass

-   Tinted Glass is a type of glass that does not allow light to pass through
-   Tinted Glass is crafted by putting a Glass block in the middle of 4 Amethyst Shards
-   Tinted Glass can be obtained without silk touch; it does not shatter like normal glass

## Changes in 20w45a

-   Experience orbs now sometimes merge when in large quantities to improve performance. This does not change the rate at which the player can absorb them, it simply limits the amount of separate orbs floating around in the world. Orbs that merge will gain the lifetime of the most recently created one.
-   Simple firework rockets with 1 gunpowder can now be crafted using the recipe book
-   Dirt paths (formerly grass path) can now be made by using a shovel on dirt, podzol, mycelium or course dirt (as well as grass)
-   Minecarts and rails work in water
-   Particles now appear when pistons break blocks

### Minecarts

Minecarts and rails now work in water

-   All rails can be waterlogged (works with a dispenser & water bucket too)
-   Flowing water doesn’t break rails
-   Minecarts can pass through water, but get slowed down more than usual

## Technical Changes in 20w45a

-   Entities are now saved separately from terrain chunks.
-   Added loot table function set\_banner\_pattern
-   Pack format in version.json has been split into data and resource versions
-   Servers can now require custom resource packs to be accepted

### Custom server resource packs

A dedicated server can enforce custom resource packs by setting `require-resource-pack` in `server.properties`. When this option is used, players will be prompted for a response and will be disconnected if they decline the required pack.

### Entity storage

Entities have been extracted from main (terrain) chunks and are now stored in separate `entities` directory (similar to POI storage). Those new files are still region files with NBT.

### Loot tables

#### New functions

##### `set_banner_pattern`

Sets tags needed for banner patterns. Parameters:

-   `patterns` - list of pattern objects:
    -   `pattern` - name of pattern (`square_bottom_left`, `bricks`, etc.)
    -   `color` - name of color (`light_gray`, etc.)
-   `append` - if `true`, new elements will be appended to existing ones instead of replacing

# Minecraft 1.16.4 Pre-Release 2

Time for another pre-release! This time around we've fixed some issues with the new social interactions screen and we've also fixed some crashes.

In case you haven't heard, yesterday we announced that Mojang accounts will be migrating into Microsoft accounts. With this pre-release, we are preparing for that by having the game understand the settings and block-list of Microsoft accounts. You can read more about that over [here](https://www.minecraft.net/article/java-edition-moving-house), and you can find answers to questions you might have in the [FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/articles/360050865492). The FAQ will be continuously updated.

We aim to release 1.16.4 sometime during next week.

# Minecraft 1.16.4 Pre-Release 1

The first pre-release for 1.16.4 is officially out! ​ If you’ve been on the Internet for some time, you’ve probably noticed that you occasionally run into other players that you don’t get along with. To alleviate some of that frustration, we’re introducing a UI element called the “social interactions screen”, which will let you disable chatting with certain players, thus hiding any messages you receive from them. Additionally, the 1.16.4 update will contain some fixes for critical bugs, but other than that, this will be it for this dot-release. ​ Please help us out by testing the new UI and reporting any bugs you find on the [Minecraft Issue Tracker](https://aka.ms/snapshotbugs?ref=launcher). ​

## Changes in 20w30a

-   Modified how respawn positions are chosen for beds and respawn anchors
-   Lanterns can now be waterlogged
-   Soul Lanterns can now be waterlogged
-   Tweaked the Bastion Remnant chest loot
-   Chests in Bastion Remnants are now more likely to be located on top of gilded blackstone

### Respawn Block Positions

-   Respawn anchors will prioritize cardinal directions over corners
-   Beds will prioritize the side of the bed the player entered from and then spaces circling around the foot of the bed up to the head of the bed
-   Respawning players will now face the block that they respawned at
-   Placing players onto dangerous blocks is now avoided when possible

## Technical Changes in 20w30a

-   The sign edit screen will now intialize from existing sign text (should have no noticeable impact on vanilla)
-   Tags can now have optional entries

### Optional Tag Entries

Entries in tags can now be marked as optional. Failure to resolve optional entries does not prevent the whole tag from loading.

Example:

    {
      "replace": false,
      "values": [
        "#minecraft:beds", // existing syntax
        { "id":"#missing:tag", "required": false }, // optional sub-tag entry
    "minecraft:anvil", // existing syntax
    { "id":"minecraft:stone_button", "required": true }, // new syntax for required tags
    { "id":"missing:block", "required": false } // optional single-element entry

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w28a

# Minecraft 1.16 Release Candidate

Out with the old, and in with the new! Today we're introducing a new naming convention (well, it's been a while) for Minecraft Java Edition. Previously, the last pre-release was, in fact, the release candidate, but we're now making that more clear by changing the name to be "release candidate". This means that if there are no major issues following this release, no further changes will be done before the full release.

Speaking of the full release: In case you've been living under a rock (it's Minecraft, so that's OK), [we're releasing the Nether Update on Tuesday, June 23](https://www.minecraft.net/article/the-nether-update-has-date-). That's next week!

## Fixed Bugs in 1.16 Release Candidate 1

-   Fixed issues with the Nether surface generation, causing issues like floating lava and crimson forests without nylium
-   [MC-150543](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-150543) Using a stonecutter can sometimes crash the game in certain circumstances
-   [MC-174790](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-174790) Mob on turtle eggs causes the game to crash
-   [MC-181833](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-181833) Crash on world startup after playing world in 20w18a

# Minecraft 1.16 Pre-Release 1

It's time for 1.16 pre-releases!

Going forward you should mostly see bugs being fixed. Additionally, pre-releases doesn't necessarily tend to our usual cadence of releasing on Wednesdays, so keep an eye out!

## New Features in 1.16 Pre-release 1

## Changes in 1.16 Pre-release 1

-   You can now milk Cows and Mooshrooms in creative mode
-   You can now get stew from Mooshrooms in creative mode
-   When you use an empty bucket on water in creative mode, you now get a bucket of water. If you have a bucket of water in your inventory already, no additional water buckets will be added when you use your empty bucket on water.
-   When any villager is struck by lightning, the witch it is converted to will no longer despawn
-   Added gamerule universalAnger (disabled by default), which makes angered neutral mobs attack any nearby player, not just the player that angered them. Works best if you disable forgiveDeadPlayers.
-   Added gamerule forgiveDeadPlayers (enabled by default), which makes angered neutral mobs stop being angry when the targeted player dies nearby.
-   Zombified piglins no longer attack innocent bystanders (unless you enable gamerule universalAnger)
-   Zombified piglins stop being angry if the targeted player dies nearby (unless you disable gamerule forgiveDeadPlayers)

## Technical Changes in 1.16 Pre-release 1

-   Smithing recipes can now be added or changed through data packs
-   Game will now detect critical datapack issues, like missing required tags and prevent world from being loaded

### Data Pack Selection

-   Data packs can now be selected before world is created
-   "Copy world" option will also copy data packs present in source world

### Pack Selection Screen

-   Packs can now be dropped directly on data and resource pack selection screens
-   Dropped files and directories will be copied to appropriate places

### Smithing Recipes

There's now a `smithing` recipe type. Recipes of this type are used in the smithing table to upgrade one item type into another type, maintaining tags.

-   `base` - Ingredient specifying an item to be upgraded.
-   `addition` - Ingredient specifying valid items to trigger the upgrade.
-   `result` - Item specifying the resulting type of the upgraded item.

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w22a

It has been a busy week for us but we still wanted to squeeze out a snapshot as we've been busy squashing a bunch of bugs.

## Experimental Rendering Changes

We've included some experimental changes to graphics rendering in this snapshot, which might reveal some issues on a small number of older graphics cards.

If do you find any new graphical bugs then please report them to the bug tracker with the make and model of your graphics card as well as which operating system you are using ​

## New Features in 20w22a

​

-   Piglins now sometimes dance in celebration of a completed hunt

​

## Changes in 20w22a

​

-   Villager workstation logic changes
-   Bells can be hung from the underside of more blocks
-   When a villager that was traded with is struck by lightning, the witch it is converted to will no longer despawn
-   Players can no longer mount another entity when the crouch key is held down

​

### Villager Workstation Logic

​

-   Villagers no longer try to work at the same workstation
-   The most experienced nearby villager for the profession corresponding to the workstation you add will get the workstation
-   Villagers now have to walk to and reach the workstation before they can acquire the profession / work there
-   Villagers can no longer claim workstations / professions during raids or night time.
-   Villagers will check and make sure their workstation is valid at all times of day as long as they are within 16 blocks of their workstation.

​

## Technical Changes in 20w22a

​

-   Slightly changed datapack loading to prevent custom datapacks from crashing
-   Cached repeated block type lookups and collisions during pathfinding for increased performance
-   Minor optimizations in collision detection
-   Top level element in predicate file can now be array (all contents will be ANDed)
-   Added shader support for accessing depth buffer.
-   Renderer now uses per-pixel blending layers for some transparent elements.

​

### Datapack loading

​

-   If datapack reload fails, changes will not be applied and game will continue using previous data
-   If existing datapacks prevent world from loading, game will give option to load world in safe mode, which loads only vanilla datapack
-   Changes to datapack list are stored only after successful reload
-   Added `--safeMode` option to server to load only with vanilla datapack
-   Game will now detect critical datapack issues, like missing required tags and prevent world from being loaded

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w21a

In this snapshot, we're adding support for custom world settings and custom dimensions. This is an early release to hear your feedback about this feature - do note that this support is considered experimental and unsupported. Any custom world settings may change from one snapshot to the next, and worlds using custom settings will be clearly marked as experimental in your worlds list. ​

## New Features in 20w21a

​

-   Added the ability to toggle redstone wire between a cross and a dot
-   Added import/export world settings functionality
-   Added a new disableMultiplayer command line option - when used, the Multiplayer button is disabled
-   Added a new disableChat command line option - when used, receiving and sending online chat is disabled

​

### Redstone Toggle

​

-   When right clicking a single piece of redstone, it toggles between a the cross and the dot
-   A dot of redstone will not power its surrounding blocks

​

## Changes in 20w21a

​

-   Piglins no longer walk around when admiring gold
-   If you hurt a piglin while it is admiring an ingot, the ingot will now disappear
-   Increased the chance of ores to generate in the Basalt Deltas to balance against the reduced amount of Netherrack in this biome
-   Lily pads are now considered junk fishing loot rather than treasure
-   Updated logos for Mojang Studios and Minecraft
-   Temporarily removed structure settings from flat level preset strings (workaround: use import/export settings functionality)

​

## Technical Changes in 20w21a

​

-   Added the ability to control the height of the `spreadplayers` command
-   Added custom worlds and custom dimensions

​

### Commands

​

#### `spreadplayers`

​ Added an optional argument to specify maximum height. New syntax: `spreadplayers <center> <spreadDistance> <maxRange> [under <maxHeight>] <respectTeams> <targets>` ​

-   `maxHeight` - Specifies the maximum height for resulting positions

​

#### `locate`

​

-   Structure names are now specified as lowercase

​

### Custom Worlds

​

-   Added experimental support for new custom worlds
-   Edit world screen now has an option to export world settings to a JSON file
-   During world creation you can import previously exported world settings
-   A bunch of new parameters are exposed, but marked as experimental, meaning you can play with them, but there is no guarantee that any of them will continue working (even in the next snapshot!)
-   Flat level preset string lost structure settings (they are now stored in a common format for all worlds), we will restore some form of this functionality soon
-   Buffet world can no longer be created from server.properties, flat level settings changed a bit; better support for custom world creation on the server is coming soon

​

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w20b

This week we are releasing a bit of a smaller snapshot. However, if you're into switching game modes and completing advancements, this is right up your alley!

**Edit:** We've now released 20w20b to fix a bug

## Fixed Bug in 20w20b

-   [MC-183769](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-183769) NPE in server initialization

## New Features in 20w20a

-   Added new Game Mode Switcher debug menu
-   Added new Nether Advancements

​

### Game Mode Switcher

New F3 debug feature which allows you to switch game modes with traditional "tabbing" functionality. ​

-   Hold F3 and tap F4 to open the menu
-   Tapping F4 will cycle the game mode, or you can use the mouse
-   Release F3 to apply
-   Your last game mode is remembered and will be the first selected option, so you can quickly toggle between two game modes with a single press of F3 + F4!

​

#### F3 + N (Toggle Spectator)

A small change has been made to this debug combination. ​

-   By default, using this key would return to Creative after toggling from Spectator. It now will toggle back to the previous game mode you had.
-   As an example, if you were in Survival, then toggled to Spectator and back, you would be set back to Survival.

​

-   `Those Were the Days` unlocks when entering a Bastion

-   `Oh Shiny` unlocks when distracting an angry Piglin with gold

​

## Changes in 20w20a

-   The `Bullseye` advancement now unlocks when hitting the bullseye of a target block from at least 30 meters away
-   The `Serious Dedication` advancement is now awarded for obtaining a Netherite Hoe
-   Obtaining Blackstone now also counts for the `Stone Age` advancement
-   Breeding Striders now counts for `The Parrots and the Bats` and is now required for `Two by Two`

​

## Technical Changes in 20w20a

-   Shulkers with "NoAI" can now be summoned with rotation.
-   Added `thrown_item_picked_up_by_entity` advancement trigger
-   Added `player_generates_container_loot` advancement trigger
-   Added `item_used_on_block` advancement trigger
-   Removed `safely_harvest_honey` advancement trigger

​

### Advancements

#### `item_used_on_block` trigger type

Properties:

-   `item` matches the thrown item which was picked up
-   `entity` matches the entity which picked up the item

​

#### `player_generates_container_loot` trigger type

​

#### `item_used_on_block` trigger type

Properties:

​

### Miscellaneous trigger changes

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w18a

In this snapshot we made some changes to Redstone wire and we fixed a bunch of bugs.

## Changes in 20w18a

-   Redstone wire changes
-   The target block now conducts redstone signals

​

### Redstone wire

The blockstate, rendering and behavior of redstonewire are more in line with each other. Redstone will provide power to blocks on all sides it shows a visual connection to, and not do so on those sides without a visual connection. ​

-   A single redstone wire is now represented as a cross.
-   A wire on top of a block, which is redirected from below, will power the sides it is redirected to now. E.g. a fence gate above the redirecting wire will be powered.
-   Wires that redirect upwards to wires on non-conductive blocks used to only be redirected visually. Now this redirection applies to their behavior as well.
-   A wire that is redirected to go over a block will now always provide power to the block. This is most noticeable when the wire has signal strength 1.

​![Comparison between 1.15.2 and snapshot 20w18a](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/images/RedstoneChanges3_741x421.png)

## Technical Changes in 20w18a

-   Added a `enable-status` option to the server.properties file which if set to `false` will suppress replies to status requests from clients. This makes the server appear offline in the multiplayer screen.
-   Added control over how much entity data a server sends to clients
-   Advancement system changes

​

### Entity Broadcasting

It is now possible to control at what range the server sends data about entities to clients. ​

-   Added an `entity-broadcast-range-percentage` server property controlling how close entities need to be before being sent to clients. Higher values means entities are visible further away from players but cause more network traffic. Specifies percentage of default value, so for example `50` specifies half of the default range.

​

### Advancements

-   Added `player` check to every trigger (except `impossible`)
-   Entity checks in triggers can now use loot table condition syntax

​

#### Extended entity checks

Entity checks in triggers can now use loot table condition syntax. Old notation:

    {
      "trigger": "minecraft:player_killed_entity",
      "conditions": {
        "entity": {
          "type": "minecraft:blaze"
        }
      }
    }
    

is now equivalent to:

    {
      "trigger": "minecraft:player_killed_entity",
      "conditions": {
        "entity": [
          {
            "condition": "minecraft:entity_properties",
            "predicate": {
              "type": "minecraft:blaze"
            },
            "entity": "this"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    

**Note 1**: Like in loot tables, all conditions in top level array must be met for whole condition to trigger. ​ **Note 2**: To access new functionality, top level element must be JSON array. JSON object are interpreted as old notation.  
​ Full list of extended triggers:

-   New field `player` in every trigger
-   `bred_animals` - `parent`, `partner`, `child`
-   `channeled_lightning` - `victims`
-   `cured_zombie_villager` - `zombie`, `villager`
-   `fishing_rod_hooked` - `entity`
-   `killed_by_crossbow` - `victims`
-   `player_killed_entity` - `entity`
-   `entity_killed_player` - `entity`
-   `player_hurt_entity` - `entity`
-   `summoned_entity` - `entity`
-   `tame_animal` - `entity`
-   `target_hit` - `projectile`
-   `villager_trade` - `villager`

​

#### Miscellaneous trigger changes

-   Due to addition of `player`, existing contents of `location`, `slept_in_bed`, `hero_of_the_village`, `voluntary_exile` can now be placed in `location` field instead of top-level object. Old syntax is still supported, but depreciated.

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w17a

This week's snapshot brings you some tweaks, bugfixes, and technical changes!

We also have a survey up so that you can tell us what you think about the Nether Update. You can find it by clicking [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SF65G2F). We would very much appreciate if you could take the time and fill it out.

## New Features in 20w17a

-   Added an Entity Distance scale option ranging from 50% to 500%
-   Difficulty and game rules can now be changed from "Create World" screen

## Changes in 20w17a

-   Improved Smithing Table UI
-   Ruined portals now spawn less frequently
-   Renamed "Soul Fire Torch" and "Soul Fire Lantern" to "Soul Torch" and "Soul Lantern"
-   Tweaked Bastion Remnant loot
-   Walls now create posts under more things, like pressure plates and banners
-   The "Singleplayer" button will jump directly to "Create World" screen if there are no worlds to select

## Technical Changes in 20w17a

-   Block storage format in chunks slightly changed to speed up various tasks (rendering, pathfinding, world generation, etc).
-   Chat component style can now select font.
-   Full range of Unicode characters is supported (some may know what that means 😉)
-   Added the `attribute` command

### World save format

-   Saving `level.dat` now uses randomly-named temporary files (instead of using `level.dat_new` every time)
-   `player/*.dat` are now saved in a way similar to `level.dat` (including leaving `.dat_old` files)

### Block storage

`BlockStates` in `Sections` elements no longer contain values stretching over multiple 64-bit fields. If number of bits per block is not power of two (i.e. single 64-bit value can't fill whole number of blockstates) some bits will not be used. For example, if single block state takes 5 bits, highest 4 bits of every 64-bit field will be unused. That also means slight increase in storage size (in case of 5 bits, from 320 to 342 64-bit fields).

### Commands

#### `attribute`

Adds modifies attribute on single entity. Possible syntax: Parameters:

-   `attribute <target> <attribute> get [<scale>]` - get total value of attribute
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> base set <value>` - sets base valye
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> base get [<scale>]` - get base value
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> modifier add <uuid> <name> <value> add|multiply|multiply_base` - adds modifier (fails if modifier is already present)
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> modifier remove <uuid>` - removes modifier
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> modifier value get <uuid> [<scale>]` - get value of modifier
-   `target` - single entity (note: only players, armor stands and mobs have attributes)
-   `attribute` - name of attribute (like `minecraft:generic.max_health`)
-   `name` - string (in optional quotes) describing human-readable name of modifier
-   `value` - floating point value (note: certain attributes have limits on final value, so your change might not be noticeable)

### Chat components

#### Hover event argument

-   `style.hoverEvent` parameter now has parameter `contents`, with contents depending on type:
    -   For `show_text` - chat component
    -   For `show_item` - either item id or object with fields `id`, `count` and `tag` (with last one being serialized NBT)
    -   For `show_entity` - object with fields: `id` (UUID), `name` (chat component) and `type` (entity type resource location)
-   Old style `value` argument is now deprecated (but still supported)

#### Colors

`color` property can now contain RGB value prefixed by `#`. For example `#55ff55` will result in the same color as `green`.

#### Custom fonts

Chat component style now supports `font` property, which is resource location for font in resource pack. No entry is equivalent to `minecraft:default`.

### Fonts

-   `Force Unicode` option now switches between normal and alternative font (called `uniform.json`) - no reload needed

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w16a

Bastion remnants, or "home sweet home" as Piglins would call them, are finally here! This snapshot introduces the home of the Piglins. If you scour the world you might also find ruins of some old portals.

## New Features in 20w16a

-   Added Bastion Remnants!
-   Added Ruined Portals
-   Added chain blocks
-   Added a new music disc titled "Pigstep" by Lena Raine which can only be found in Bastions Remnants

### Bastion Remnants

What's made of Blackstone and full of piglins and hoglins? Bastion Remnants!

-   Added 4 separate Bastion Remnant types: Bridge, Hoglin Stable, Housing Units, and Treasure Room
-   You can find these sizable structures in all biomes in the Nether except the treacherous ash-dusted towers of Basalt Deltas
-   Explore, loot, and conquer a Bastion Remnant to call it your home...but beware, Piglins don't take kindly to intruders stealing their things

### Ruined Portals

Shattered remains of ancient nether portals. Wonder who built them?

-   They can be found in any overworld or nether biome
-   Some are hidden underground, under the sea, or buried in sand

## Changes in 20w16a

-   The piglin banner pattern can now be found in Bastion Remnants
-   Increased the amount of lava pools to make the deltas more "deltary"

## Technical Changes in 20w16a

-   Added a button in the GUI that generates a jigsaw structure starting from the jigsaw block, using given generation depth.
-   Expanded the max size per axis of Structure Blocks from 32 to 48
-   Added a JMX MBean to monitor dedicated server tick times

### JMX Monitoring

It is now possible to monitor the server tick times though JMX. The rationale for this is that JMX is a well known and supported monitoring technology with existing integrations and tools.

This enables server admins to hook alerts and graphing tools using ordinary JMX clients and dashboards.

#### Enabling JMX Monitoring

-   A new flag `enable-jmx-monitoring` has been added to the server.properties file which if set to `true` will expose an MBean with the Object name `net.minecraft.server:type=Server` and two attributes `averageTickTime` and `tickTimes` exposing the tick times in milliseconds.
-   In order for enabling JMX on the Java runtime you also need to add a couple of JVM flags to the startup as documented [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html).

## Fixed bugs in 20w16a

-   [MC-37557](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-37557) Sometimes a minecart sound plays/subtitle shown when loading a world
-   [MC-91163](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-91163) Certain subtitles show up when the player is too far away to hear the sound
-   [MC-154617](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-154617) Server hangs on stop due to rcon
-   [MC-171020](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-171020) New nether biomes don't work properly in buffet worlds
-   [MC-175919](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-175919) Villagers sometimes stop farming
-   [MC-177136](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-177136) All compasses and lodestone compasses point to the same target, regardless of what type of compass it is
-   [MC-177238](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-177238) Windows symbolic link in saves/ is no longer followed as of 20w14a
-   [MC-177253](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-177253) Running a set\_attributes function throws java.lang.NullPointerException if it contains an undefined attribute
-   [MC-177316](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-177316) Lodestone compass in item frame does not update after turning
-   [MC-178368](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-178368) When rotating a lodestone compass is put in the item frame the compass don't work

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w15a

It's a wonderful day here in Sweden today! The sun is shining and spring is in the air, and when I say "spring" I mean **pollen**. Let's remedy that by 1) Staying indoors and 2) Introduce an all new biome with a grain of basalt, blackstone, and magma cubes! To spice it up, we also have some new fine tunes for you to listen to while traversing the Nether. Enjoy the snapshot!

## New Features in 20w15a

-   Accessibility improvements
-   Added a piglin banner pattern
-   Added Basalt Deltas biome to the Nether
-   Added soul campfires. Warm your buns with the heat of one thousand souls!
-   Added three new tracks of Nether music
-   Added chiseled nether bricks, cracked nether bricks, and quartz bricks!
-   Added a new set of stone blocks called Blackstone with regular, polished, and polished brick variants!
-   Added Gilded Blackstone - Blackstone which has been imbued with gold and has a chance of dropping gold nuggets when broken
-   Blackstone can be used to craft furnaces and stone tools

### Accessibility

-   Added "Line Spacing" chat and accessibility option
-   Added "Chat Delay" accessibility option

### Basalt Deltas

Basalt Deltas can now be found in the Nether!

-   Remnants of volcanic eruptions, this biome sports a high concentration of Basalt columns and lava deltas
-   Walking through, you will be surrounded by flakes of flowing white ash
-   Magma Cubes finally have a place to call home, spawning very frequently
-   A new block, Blackstone, can be found in large patches here

### Nether Music

We're happy to announce that we've added three new tracks for the upcoming Nether Update, all composed by the very talented Lena Raine.

-   Rubedo will be played in the Nether Wastes
-   So Below will be played in Soul Sand Valleys and in Basalt Deltas
-   Chrysopoeia will be played in Crimson Forests

Some words from Lena:

-   "One of the primary instruments in Minecraft is the piano, and so one of my challenges to myself was to see how far I could push the sound of the piano until it resembled other things entirely–again, that alchemical process."
-   "I wanted each piece to feel like a progression of emotions, or a journey from place to place within this other world. There's a degree of beauty to the Nether, but it is also terrifying in both its details and scale."

Take a portal to the Nether, and stay awhile and listen...

## Changes in 20w15a

-   Dispenser changes
-   Soul sand can now be used to craft soul torches
-   Nether vegetation blocks (sprouts, roots, vines, fungus, wart and wart blocks) are now compostable
-   Walls will now connect to more things! (like iron bars, panes and even pickles!)
-   Hoes are now the appropriate tool for mining leaves
-   Mobs now avoid walking on magma blocks and lit campfires

### Dispensers

-   Dispensers can now saddle pigs and horses
-   Dispensers can now put horse armor on horses
-   Dispensers can now put carpets on llamas
-   Dispensers can now put chests on llamas, donkeys and mules
-   Dispensers can now shear a Mooshroom
-   Dispensers can shear snow golems

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w14a

Even though we just added [every update imaginable to Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/article/every-update-imaginable-coming-minecraft), we thought that it might be good to pick up the Nether Update snapshots from where we left off. This snapshot introduces the Zoglins!

## New Features in 20w14a

-   Hoglins that somehow end up in the Overworld become Zoglins fairly quickly - but who would ever bring a Hoglin to the Overworld?
-   Compasses can now be enchanted with Curse of Vanishing

​

### Zoglins

​

-   Zoglins are zombified hoglins - the result of bringing a hoglin into the overworld
-   Unlike hoglins they can't be bred or fed, and they don't care about warped fungus
-   Beware - these beasts are raving mad and attack just about everything they see!

## Changes in 20w14a

-   The main menu background is now in the Nether
-   The General statistics list is now alphabetically sorted
-   Strider balancing

### Strider Balancing

-   Strider speed while mounted has been significantly increased to more closely resemble boat speeds
-   Warped Fungus on a Stick now has 100 max item damage, and only takes 1 damage per Strider consume
-   When Warped Fungus on a Stick is used with Striders, the boost is a great way to traverse the lava seas

​

## Technical Changes in 20w14a

-   The compass now has `LodestonePos`, `LodestoneDimension` and `LodestoneTracked` data fields. If `LodestoneTracked` is zero, the game will skip checking for a Lodestone in the specified position.
-   Attributes are now added to game registry, similar to items, sound events, etc.
-   Region files are now opened in synchronous mode to increase reliability

​

### Attributes

Attributes have been moved to game registry. That means few changes: ​

-   Items and entities will no longer keep unknown attributes
-   Names of some attributes have been renamed to meet resource location requirements

#### Renames:

-   `generic.maxHealth` 🡆 `generic.max_health`
-   `zombie.spawnReinforcements` 🡆 `zombie.spawn_reinforcements`
-   `horse.jumpStrength` 🡆 `horse.jump_strength`
-   `generic.followRange` 🡆 `generic.follow_range`
-   `generic.knockbackResistance` 🡆 `generic.knockback_resistance`
-   `generic.movementSpeed` 🡆 `generic.movement_speed`
-   `generic.flyingSpeed` 🡆 `generic.flying_speed`
-   `generic.attackDamage` 🡆 `generic.attack_damage`
-   `generic.attackKnockback` 🡆 `generic.attack_knockback`
-   `generic.attackSpeed` 🡆 `generic.attack_speed`
-   `generic.armorToughness` 🡆 `generic.armor_toughness`

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w11a

In this snapshot you can be on your merry way across the beautiful Soulsand Valleys with your freshly enchanted boots. It's a bit scary to be fair, so these boots will help you out with that bit...

## Before we dive into this snapshot, a word about Redstone

Redstone is one of the coolest things in Minecraft and many of you are members of communities that focus on building mind-blowing redstone contraptions, farms, computing machines and 256x256 piston doors.

A lot of redstone behaviour is currently categorized as “undefined”. This is when the behaviour of the block is not the result of intentional code but is a side-effect of unaccounted edge cases or quirks in the game code.​

We know that many players consider undefined behaviour as a very interesting aspect of redstone and enjoy experimenting with and using undefined behaviour to build unique contraptions to share with the rest of the community.​

However, the quirks of undefined behaviour can be quite surprising - even when building simple contraptions. This quirkiness can be a negative experience for players new to redstone and may turn them away from this very unique and exciting aspect of Minecraft as well as the vast redstone community behind it.​

Our goal is to bring all redstone components up to a level of quality that we are happy with and we will be making adjustments where it makes the most sense for redstone going forward.

Any changes we make will be communicated in the snapshot changelogs and as always we will be reading your feedback and comments.

## Changes in 20w11a

-   TNT and Campfires will now ignite when hit by any burning projectile

-   Doors, rails, buttons, pressure plates, redstone and more can now be placed on soulsand and full-block of snow layers
-   Soul sand with a rail on top will no longer slow-down minecarts

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w10a

Today's snapshot is loud! It comes with a bunch of new ambient sound that adds some really nice flavour to the Nether biomes. Apart from this, you now have to use the smithing table to craft Netherite. Happy mining!

## New Features in 20w10a

-   Added crimson and warped hyphae – all-sided "stem" blocks including stripped variations
-   Use a smithing table to fuse the Netherite ingot with your diamond weapon/tool/armor
-   New ambient sounds for the Nether biomes

​

## Changes in 20w10a

​

-   Hoes are now more like other tools used to break blocks
-   Fish now despawn when further than 64 blocks away from the closest player
-   Updated netherite item textures

​

### Hoe Changes

​ We've made some changes to Hoes to make them more useful in the Nether. ​

-   Each tier has different speed at which Hoes mine blocks they are effective against
-   Hoes can now be enchanted with the following enchantments: Efficiency, Fortune, Silk Touch
-   Those enchantments can now be provided through the enchanting table.

​

## Technical Changes in 20w10a

​

### Entity UUIDs

​

-   UUIDs of the owners of projectiles, such as arrows or snowballs, are now stored as an array of four integers. All UUIDs will be stored in this format in the future

​

### New tags for item frames

​

-   `Invisible` - makes item frame invisible (item inside frame remains visible)
-   `Fixed` - prevents item frame from being broken and the item inside from being removed

​

### `target_hit` advancement trigger type

​ Conditions:

-   `signal_strength` matches the signal strength output from the block on hit

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w09a

Today is a sad day for Obsidian... It's crying. If you're not into crying you could always take aim at the new Target that we've added.

This update can also be found on [minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-20w09a).

If you find any bugs, please report them on the official [Minecraft Issue Tracker](https://aka.ms/snapshotbugs?ref=reddit).

## New Features in 20w09a

-   Added the Target Block!
-   Added new Crying Obsidian block! It's sad and it cries purple energy

### Target Block

Because let’s face it, your aim could use some practice

-   The closer you hit to the center, the larger the redstone signal!
-   Test your skills with a variety of projectiles, including eggs, snowballs, tridents, and more!
-   You will need one hay block and four redstone for this recipe

### Zombified Piglin

-   Zombie Pigmen are now known as Zombified Piglins, and they now have ears... or well, one at least

## Changes in 20w09a

-   Bartering loot has been restructured to be more appealing to Survival players
-   Crying Obsidian can now be obtained from Piglin Bartering
-   Entities now get pushed by flowing lava
-   Huge Fungi will now grow only on its matching type of Nylium
-   Can now place Warped/Crimson roots and fungi into pots
-   Nether wart blocks and warped wart block can be cleared quickly using a hoe
-   Weeping vines are now climbable!
-   Biome fog color smoothly blends between biomes. Smooth
-   Changed ambient block lighting in the Nether to be on parity with other editions

### Block Renames

Some blocks have been renamed. Turns out singular Fungus in the Nether attempted to falsely present itself as many Fungi - very sneaky!

-   Crimson Fungi is now called Crimson Fungus
-   Warped Fungi is now called Warped Fungus

## Technical Changes in 20w09a

-   New particle types: `dripping_obsidian_tear`, `falling_obsidian_tear`, `landing_obsidian_tear`
-   Piglins now have an `IsImmuneToZombification` data value that prevents them from zombifying in the overworld

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w08a

A wild snapshot appears! To tell you the truth, we hadn't actually planned to do a snapshot this week, but the Villagers were in dire need of neurosurgery.

## Fixed bug in 20w08a

-   [MC-172078](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-172078) All villagers with saved memory disappear when upgrading to 20w07a

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w07a

Ahh, a freshly baked snapshot! It undoubtedly smells better than the piglins that we just added...

## Features in 20w07a

-   Endermen can now pick up some of the new Nether blocks
-   Endermen will no longer pick up Netherrack
-   Gave Hoglins some actual functionality
-   Added Piglins
-   Netherite blocks can be used as the base of a beacon and Netherite ingots can be used as the fuel for a beacon. Weird flex but ok.

### Advancements

-   Piglins and hoglins are now required for Monster Hunter and Monsters Hunted

### Hoglins

-   Hoglins are big aggressive beasts that live in crimson forests in the nether
-   They attack players on sight, so be careful, they can easily knock you off a ledge!
-   Hoglins drop pork and sometimes leather, but not willingly
-   You can breed hoglins by feeding them crimson fungi, but do so at your own risk
-   Hoglins get hunted by piglins sometimes, but they don't go down without a fight!
-   Despite this, hoglins and piglin aren't enemies - they are more like an ecosystem
-   Baby hoglins like to pretend they are tough - but don't worry, they are more like angry puppies with no teeth
-   Want to keep hoglins off your back? Pro tip: Hoglins hate the smell of warped fungi!

### Piglins

-   Piglins are an aggressive civilization that live in the nether
-   They mostly hang around in the crimson forest, but you might find some in the nether wastes too
-   They think of players as target practice and will attack on sight
-   However if you dress appropriately they will see you as a respectable figure, or tolerable at least
-   Piglins are suspicious of strangers and if they see you opening a chest, or mining a block of gold, they will assume that you're stealing and will treat you accordingly
-   Piglins LOVE gold and get very distracted by gold items
-   Gold ingots are currency to piglins and you can throw ingots at them or right-click them with an ingot to barter for various goods
-   Piglins sometimes get hungry and hunt hoglins for food. Or they try at least. They results... vary.
-   Piglins prefer to hunt and fight in groups, and when a fight is happening everyone wants in
-   Piglins that somehow end up in the overworld become zombified fairly quickly
-   Piglins are creeped out by soul fire and zombified piglins, and will stay clear whenever possible
-   Wither skeletons are a historic enemy and piglins will attack on sight
-   Baby piglins are not as dangerous, but they can be mischievous so watch your back
-   ... and they like to play with baby hoglins

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w06a

## Features in 20w06a

-   Added new Nether blocks!
-   Knockback resistance is now a scale instead of a probability
-   Added Crimson Forest biome to the Nether
-   Added Hoglins - they don't do much yet, but they have cute flappy ears!
-   Patrols no longer spawn when the player is close to any village
-   Added Netherite!
-   Added Soulsand Valley biome to the Nether
-   Walls do not have gaps anymore when stacked vertically
-   Added Warped Forest biome to the Nether

### Blocks

Many new block types have been added!

-   Two new wood-like materials - Crimson Stems and Warped Stems
-   Basalt blocks - you can find them as pillars but they can be placed in any direction
-   New ground surface blocks: Crimson Nylium and Warped Nylium
-   New vegetation: Nether Sprouts, Crimson Roots and Warped Roots
-   Two types of Fungi: Crimson and Warped - try using bone meal to grow them!
-   Warped Wart blocks
-   Weeping Vines that grow from the bottom of a block downwards!
-   A new natural light source: Shroomlights
-   Added Soul Soil! Whenever fire burns on Soul Soil, it burns with a blue flame!
-   Soul Soil can be used to craft Soul Torches - and those can be crafted into Soul Lanterns!
-   Using bone meal on Netherrack can now spread Nylium

### Crimson Forest

Crimson Forests can now be found in the Nether!

-   Crimson nylium carpets the cave floor with all kinds of strange new vegetation
-   Huge Crimson Fungi make up the "trees" of this forest, with Shroomlights lighting up the forest floor
-   Weeping Vines grow from the cave ceilings and fungi
-   Hoglins wander these Forests
-   Crimson spores swirl through the air

### Netherite

-   A new high level material found in the Nether. Use it to upgrade your diamond gear!

#### How to make Netherite

-   Mine Ancient Debris in the lower depths of the Nether. At own risk. No insurance coverage for that.
-   Refine it into Netherite Scrap in a furnace (although that's kind of slow so you might want a Blast Furnace).
-   Combine 4 Nether Scrap with 4 Gold Ingots in a crafting table to make a Netherite Ingot.

#### Netherite effects

-   Netherite items float in lava. So you don't lose all your gear after that unplanned lava bath.
-   Netherite items have higher enchantment value than diamond (but not as high as gold).
-   Netherite tools work faster and last longer than diamond.
-   Netherite weapons do more damage than diamond.
-   Netherite armor have higher toughness and durability than diamond.
-   Netherite armor gives you knockback resistance, so you barely get knocked back at all when hit by arrows and such.
-   And it looks cool!

### Soulsand Valley

Soulsand Valleys can now be found in the Nether!

-   An open space made mostly of Soul Sand and Soul Soil
-   Basalt pillars span from floor to ceiling
-   Fossile remains of unknown creatures from the past litter the valley
-   Ash falls through the air
-   A light blue glow envelopes the valley
-   Beware of Skeletons here

### Sounds

-   Ghasts sounds are now heard at shorter range
-   Updated block sounds for Bone Blocks, Netherrack, Soul Sand, Netherwart, Nether Bricks and Quartz Ore

### Warped Forest

Warped Forests can now be found in the Nether!

-   Warped nylium carpets the cave floor with all kinds of strange new vegetation
-   Huge Warped Fungi make up the "trees" of this forest, with Shroomlights lighting up the forest floor
-   A dark blue fog covers the forest!
-   Warped spores swirl through the air
-   The Warped Forests are strange, but also the least hostile place of Nether

### World Generation

-   The old Nether biome is now called Nether Wastes
-   Made shipwrecks and ocean ruins a bit less common, so you get more excited when you find one!

## Technical changes in 20w06a

-   Added a `locatebiome` command

### Commands

#### locatebiome

New command that locates a specified biome. Useful in creative mode when you're looking for a specific biome and don't want to fly around randomly searching for it. Syntax: `locatebiome <biome>` Parameters:

-   `biome` - The id of the biome to find

### Particles

-   New particle types: ash, crimson\_spore, soul\_fire\_flame and warped\_spore

### Rendering

-   Nailed Entity shadows to the ground.
