# Minecraft Snapshot 25w07a

Frogday on a Thursday, who thinks of that?! In this week's snapshot we are updating trades for wandering traders and cartographers. We have also introduced new, biome-based spawn rules for sheep. It's time to go out and explore the world! Mojang's bug-tracker Mojira is migrating to the cloud and during the process bug reporting is unavailable. The new platform will soon be up and running, ready for players to log in, create accounts, and most importantly â€“ report bugs! During the downtime, try to keep the bug alive and report it once Mojira is back!

## New Features

-   Sheep have different rules for which wool color to have based on biome they spawn in

### Farm Animal variants

#### Sheep wool color in warm and cold biomes

-   Sheep have updated rules for which color of wool they have based on which biome they spawn in:
    -   Temperate Biomes: (these colors are unchanged from current behavior)
        -   Common sheep color is white
        -   Uncommon sheep colors are black, gray, light gray and brown
        -   There is a rare chance for a pink Sheep to spawn
    -   Cold biomes:
        -   Common Sheep color is black
        -   Uncommon Sheep colors are light gray, light blue, blue and cyan
        -   There is a rare chance for a pink Sheep to spawn
    -   Warm Biomes:
        -   Common Sheep color is brown
        -   Uncommon Sheep colors are gray, yellow, orange and red
        -   There is a rare chance for a pink Sheep to spawn

## Changes

-   A Bush only drops when broken with Shears or a Silk Touch tool and is replaceable when building
-   The look of both Mooshroom variants have been slightly updated to have an extruded snout
-   Ambient block sounds in Desert, Badlands and Pale Garden which are only used for ambience have been moved from "Blocks" to "Ambient/Environment" category
-   Cartographer and Wandering Trader has tweaks to their trades
-   Camels now spawn in Deserts
-   Bundles can now be found in some of the chests in villages
-   The breaking sound for grass sound type has been lowered affecting all blocks using this sound

### Cartographer and Wandering Trader Trade Rebalance

## Cartographer Trades

-   Cartographers now sell 7 new maps each pointing to a different village or other structures in a different biome. These maps can help players who want to quickly find a specific location
-   Cartographers from different village types will sell a different range of maps and colored banners
-   Some prices and quantities have also been adjusted

![Cartographers now sell maps to structures in different biomes (villages in Desert, Plains, Savanna, Snowy Plains or Taiga, the Swamp Hut in a Swamp or the Jungle Temple in a Jungle). Cartographers in different biomes will have a different selection of these maps, available at Apprentice level. The previously existing maps to Trial Chambers and Ocean Monuments are available at Journeyman level. Colored banners are sold at Expert level and the range is different in different biomes. A Woodland Mansion map is guaranteed at Master level along with the globe banner pattern.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/25w07acartographertrades.jpg)

## Wandering Trader Trades

-   The Wandering Trader now has better prices, more trades and a larger amount of stock for many items
-   They will also now buy basic supplies from players, so it's possible to get some emeralds by helping them prepare for their next journey even if you don't feel like buying anything
-   The Wandering Trader will offer to buy two items from this list:
    -   Water Bottle
    -   Water Bucket
    -   Milk Bucket
    -   Fermented Spider Eye
    -   Baked Potato
    -   Hay Bale
-   Wandering Traders now have a chance of selling these items (in addition to their previous trades):
    -   Logs (Acacia, Birch, Dark Oak, Jungle, Oak, Spruce, Pale Oak or Cherry)
    -   Enchanted Iron Pickaxe
    -   Potion of Invisibility

![Each Wandering Trader has two buying trades (buying Water Bottle, Water Bucket, Milk Bucket, Spider Eye, 4 Baked Potatoes or a Hay Bale) which give emeralds in return. They also have two 'special offers' where they sell Ice, Gunpowder, an Enchanted Pickaxe or any type of Logs, and five normal offers which are similar to the trades they had before this update.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/25w07awanderingtradertrades.jpg)

    -   Model now has its legs mirrored

### Shaders & Post-process Effects

> **Developer's Note**: _Although it is possible in Resource Packs, overriding Core Shaders is considered as unsupported and not an intended Resource Pack feature. These shaders exist as part of the internal implementation of the game, and as such, may change at any time as the game's internals evolve. We understand that overriding Core Shaders is used for very cool Resource Pack features, many of which lack supported alternatives. We would like to provide better, supported alternatives in the future._

-   Shader program definitions for core shaders and post-processing effects as JSON files have been removed
-   The shader programs themselves are still available and can be overridden
-   The post-processing effects are still configurable as JSON

#### Post-process Effect Definitions

-   The field `program` was replaced with `vertex_shader` and `fragment_shader`
    -   `<namespace>:<path>` will resolve to `assets/<namespace>/shaders/<path>.<vsh|fsh>`
-   `type` is now a required field for each `uniform`
    -   Possible values are currently `int`, `ivec3`, `float`, `vec2`, `vec3`, `vec4`, `matrix4`
-   `values` in each `uniform` is now optional
    -   Leaving it unset is not recommended and is used for runtime configuration of the blur effect
-   Leaving a uniform unspecified results in undefined behavior, you must specify each one that will be used by the shaders

### Item rendering

#### Item Display

-   `firstperson_lefthand` and `thirdperson_lefthand` transforms are now rendered the same as when held in hand

#### Item Entity

-   When on ground, model size is now taken into account when determining hovering motion
    -   That means that models should never clip into the block below, no matter what size they are
-   Positioning of items in an item stack on ground now depends on model size and model type
    -   If model depth (Z coordinate) is below 1/16th of a block, item is rendered as flat stack of items
    -   Otherwise model is rendered as a cluster of items offset in all directions around center
    -   Previously, flat stack rendering happened only for models with `builtin/generated` parent

This week we have been contemplating existential questions like "What came first; the cold chicken or the blue egg?". It's time for the cold chicken and the warm chicken to make their way into snapshot 25w06a together with their respective colorful egg. In addition, pink cactus flowers and dry grass will now decorate deserts and badlands.

## New Features

-   Added Warm and Cold Chicken variants
-   Added Short Dry Grass and Tall Dry Grass
-   Added Cactus Flower block which can grow on Cactus blocks

### Farm Animal variants

-   Warm and cold variants have been added for Chicken
-   Existing Chicken variant has been renamed to temperate
-   The variant is determined by the biome they spawn in
-   Warm and cold biomes are the same for all animals with variants (i.e. Chicken, Pig, Cow)
-   Two new Egg items have been added for the warm and cold Chicken variants
    -   Blue Egg - The Egg that is laid by and can hatch cold Chicken variant
    -   Brown Egg - The Egg that is laid by and can hatch warm Chicken variant
-   Already existing Egg is laid by and can hatch temperate Chicken variant

### Short and Tall Dry Grass

-   Added two new types of grass: Short Dry Grass and Tall Dry Grass
-   Both are one block high, which makes Tall Dry Grass differ from Tall Grass which is two blocks high
-   Both generate in the Desert and Badlands
-   Both can be placed on types of Sand, Terracotta and Dirt blocks like the Dead Bush
-   Both can be bone mealed
    -   Using Bone Meal on Short Dry Grass grows it into a Tall Dry Grass
    -   Using Bone Meal on Tall Dry Grass places a neighbouring Short Dry Grass next to the block if possible
-   Both can be used in the Composter
-   Sheep can eat both to regrow its wool
-   Both can be used as fuel for smelting

### Cactus Flower

-   Cactus Flower is a new type of flower which has a chance of generating on cactuses in Deserts and Badlands
-   Cactus Flower can be placed on Cactus blocks or any block which has center support at the top of the block
-   Cactus Flowers have a chance of growing on Cactus blocks
    -   If a Cactus is one or two blocks high the Cactus Flower has a 10% chance to grow instead of the Cactus getting higher
    -   If a Cactus is three blocks or higher the Cactus Flower has a 25% chance to grow
    -   Cactus Flowers will only grow if they have space on all four sides
-   Cactus Flowers can be used in the Composter
-   A Cactus Flower can be used to craft 1 Pink Dye

## Changes

-   Any block in the simulation distance of a player or loaded by another source of chunk loading (such as Ender Pearls) may now receive random ticks, instead of just 8 chunks around players
    -   For example: if a chunk is loaded by an Ender Pearl or is in the spawn chunks, crops are able to grow, Ice can melt, Snow can fall, and a Cauldron can be filled by rain
    -   Mob spawning, Lava spreading fire, and Lightning strikes still occur in the previous radius of 8 chunks around players
-   Fire will no longer burn or spread if no player is within 8 chunks
-   Tooltips for Fireworks and Crossbows now show a compact form of multiple repeated stars or projectiles that are identical

### Firefly Bush

Conditions for The Firefly Bush playing ambient sounds have changed. It now plays when all of the following conditions are met:

-   it's night
-   Firefly Bush not blocked from above by any collidable block (except Leaves)

## Technical Changes

-   Added `#eggs` - all variants of the Egg item

### Entity Data

-   The armor and off-hand equipment of Players is now also stored in the `equipment` field (although items written into the Inventory using armor and off-hand slot numbers still work)

### Chicken Variants

-   Chicken variants can be data-driven by adding entries to `data/<namespace>/chicken_variant/<id>.json`
-   This feature is experimental
-   Fields in file:
    -   `model` - one of: `normal`, `cold`
    -   `asset_id` - namespaced id for this variant asset, resolves to `assets/<namespace>/textures/<path>.png`
    -   `spawn_conditions` - field described in uniform variant selection above

## Resource Pack Version 51

-   New and updated Chicken textures
-   Added textures for new Blue Egg and Brown Egg items
-   Added textures for new Cactus Flower block
-   Added textures for new Short Dry Grass and Tall Dry Grass blocks

It's time for another snapshot! To kick things off, we are reverting the fixes for [MC-271065](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-271065) and [MC-152728](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-152728).

This week's snapshot also comes with a whole slew of datapack updates, including new components and item model capabilities. If you like to play around with datapacks, you will definitely find something fun in this update!

As always, we're keen to get your feedback on these new features at [feedback.minecraft.net](https://feedback.minecraft.net) and you can report any bugs at [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com)! Here's what's new this week:

## New Features

-   Added language support for Kyrgyz

## Changes

-   Reverted fixes:
    
    -   [MC-271065](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-271065) - Diagonal movement is not normalized when crouching or using certain items
    -   [MC-152728](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-152728) - The player continues sprinting when performing actions that slow them down
    
    > **Developer's Note**: _After consideration, we have decided to revert both fixed bugs. While we do want to revisit these mechanics in the future, it's clear that these recent fixes alone didn't quite hit the mark and caused too many negative side-effects for parkour, speedbridging, and movement in general_
    
-   Crossbows will now show all charged projectiles in their tooltip instead of just the first
    -   All charged projectiles will also add their entire tooltip as a subsection, instead of only Fireworks
-   All container items with stored contents, such as a Chest picked with Ctrl+Pick Block, will now list the first 4 items in their tooltip just like Shulker Boxes

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 64
-   The Resource Pack version is now 49

## Data Pack Versions 64

-   The `potion` entity type has been split into `splash_potion` and `lingering_potion`
-   Filled Maps without any `map_id` component no longer show an 'Unknown Map' tooltip (invalid IDs will still produce this tooltip)
-   Trim pattern and trim material items are no longer specified in the trim registries, but instead in the recipes and items respectively
-   Field `background` in advancement definition no longer contains `textures/` prefix and `.png` suffix
-   Changes to entity variant definitions
    -   Cat and Frog variants are now data-driven
    -   Added uniform way to define variant selection rules

### Commands

-   SNBT literals now accept heterogenous lists

### SNBT changes

-   SNBT (textual representation of NBT-like data) has been expanded to accept heterogenous lists, i.e. ones where elements are not of the same type
-   NBT format is not changed
    -   If SNBT command argument transforms value to NBT (like arguments of `/data` or `/summon`), lists might be transformed to bypass NBT constraints
    -   Example transform: `['a', {'b':3}]` is stored as `[{'':'a'},{'b':3}]`
    -   This transform is not reversed by `/data`

> **Developer's Note**: _Internally, in new code we read and write data in both JSON and NBT formats. This change makes sure that we don't have to worry about NBT limitations when it comes to lists. We have chosen to not expand NBT itself to avoid breaking existing external tools._

### Tags

#### Entity Tags

-   Added `#can_wear_horse_armor` - entity that can hold horse armor in their body slot

#### Damage Type Tags

-   Renamed `#bypasses_shield` to `#bypasses_blocking`

-   Selection process:
    -   Every variant field `spawn_conditions` that contain a list of entries
    -   Every entry has a condition and an integer priority
    -   Conditions for all variants for given entity type are evaluated for position where entity is being spawned
    -   Entries with priority lower than maximum priority of remaining entries are removed
    -   Game randomly picks one entry out of remaining ones
    -   If no conditions are remaining, variant remains unchanged from default
-   Entry format:
    -   `priority` - integer
    -   `condition` - optional structure
        -   Fields:
