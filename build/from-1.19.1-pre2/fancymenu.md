# Minecraft 1.19.1 Pre-Release 2

Hey everyone! As a few of you might have noticed, we’ve made the decision to postpone the release of 1.19.1 and we're now going back into pre-release mode. This is in order to address a few of our more noticeable issues. We've yet to fully decide on a new release date, but it won't be too far in the future.

We’ve received a lot of feedback regarding the Player Chat Report feature, which is something we address specifically in a newly released post [here](https://www.minecraft.net/article/addressing-player-chat-reporting-tool), as well as in our [FAQ](https://aka.ms/chatreportingfaq) which hopefully answers all your questions!

## Changes in 1.19.1 Pre-Release 2

We've added the ability to see the signing status of chat messages – this is so you can easily tell when a server is tampering with, or removing the signing security of, their players' messages.

### Chat Trust Status

-   Messages that are not signed with the Secure Chat system, or have been tampered with by the server will now be marked
    -   Messages with missing or invalid signatures are marked as "Not Secure"
    -   Messages that are detected as modified are marked as "Modified"
-   The trust status of messages are displayed with both a colored indicator and an icon
    -   The colored indicator is always visible
    -   The icon is only visible when the chat screen is open
-   Hovering over the icon will provide more information about the trust status
    -   For modified messages, the original secure text will also be displayed in the tooltip

## Technical changes in 1.19.1 Pre-Release 2

### Chat Types

-   Chat types added to the `chat_types` registry are now only used for player chat, and not system messages
    -   The `system` and `game_info` chat types have been removed
-   Chat types have been simplified and are now only required to define `chat` and `narration` decorations
    -   Chat types no longer support overlays
    -   A system message should instead be used to display overlays

### server.properties

-   `enforce-secure-profile` is now defaulted to `true` for dedicated servers

The first pre-release for 1.19.1 is now available. This release contains a few bugfixes, an increased cooldown for Allay duplication, and it also contains a new UI if you have been banned for violating the Minecraft [Community Standards](https://www.minecraft.net/community-standards). ​ On the topic of community standards and the recent introduction of the chat reporting feature, we’re working on creating a help article that aims to add some context surrounding the functionality. ​ All of this said, if everything goes as planned, we plan to release the update next Tuesday on June 28th.
