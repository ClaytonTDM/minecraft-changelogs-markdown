# Minecraft Snapshot 21w06a

Hello, new snapshot! Hello, new cave generation!

Today's snapshot introduces a major change to how caves are generated within Minecraft. You could say that we're now introducing the cave part of Caves & Cliffs.

This is only the first step in our underground adventure, so please note that snapshots show features in early development and that there are two notable caveats with this snapshot:

-   You'll be unable to open old worlds in this snapshot as there is currently no upgrade path towards the new world height
-   All caves of the new type between y31 and y63 will be flooded with water

## New Features in 21w06a

-   Added noise caves and aquifers

### Noise caves and Aquifers

-   Noise caves are a new way of generating caves, providing more natural variety. They can get really huge sometimes! Noise caves come in two flavors:
    -   Cheese caves. Like the holes in swiss cheese. These often form caverns of various size.
    -   Spaghetti caves. Long squiggly tunnels, sometimes wide like tagliatelle.
-   No, they aren't loud. The "noise" part of noise caves is a technical term and has nothing to do with sound.
-   The old cave carvers and canyons still generate, combining with the noise caves to form interesting cave systems.
-   As with carvers, when noise caves intersect the surface they form cave entrances.
-   An aquifer is an area with local water level, independent of sea level. Aquifers are used during world generation to generate bodies of water inside noise caves. This sometimes results in large underground lakes!
-   For now, aquifers are only used below y31. This means all noise caves between y31 and sea level (y63) will be flooded with water, and noise cave entrances will essentially be lakes. This will be fixed later.
-   Magma sometimes generates at the bottom of underground bodies of water
-   Underwater cave carvers and underwater canyons have been removed, since aquifers are used to generate water in caves instead.

## Changes in 21w06a

-   Overworld build and generation limits have been expanded
-   Mineshafts adapted to larger caves
-   You can no longer crouch or jump to prevent a big dripleaf from tilting
-   A big dripleaf will now tilt rather than break when hit by a projectile
-   A redstone powered big dripleaf will not tilt (except when hit by a projectile)
-   The textures for hanging roots and small dripleaves have been updated

### World generation

-   Generation range and build limits have been expanded by 64 blocks up and 64 blocks down, to a total range of 384 blocks
-   Underground features, structures, and caves generate all the way down to y -64.

### Mineshaft changes

-   Mineshaft pieces don't generate if they would be fully floating in the air
-   Mineshaft corridors are supported by log pillars when needed
-   No floating cobwebs

## Fixed bugs in 21w06a

-   [MC-214346](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-214346) Big dripleaf can be broken with arrows in spawn protection
-   [MC-213813](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-213813) Small dripleaf can destroy any block

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w05a

## New Features in 21w05a

-   Azalea bushes as well as flowering azaela bushes!
-   Added cave vines and glow berries!
-   Added drip leaves!
-   Added decorative blocks for the upcoming lush caves: hanging roots and rooted dirt!
-   Added moss!
-   Added spore blossom!

### Cave vines and glow berries

-   Cave vines grow down from the ceiling, like weeping vines
-   When they grow they have a chance of producing glow berries
-   Glow berries are a natural light source as well as a food source
-   Foxes eat glow berries
-   Use glow berries to plant new cave vines
-   Bonemealing a cave vine will create glow berries

### Dripleaf

-   Small dripleaf needs moisture, so it grows on clay or underwater
-   Small dripleaf grow into big dripleaf when bonemealed.
-   Big dripleaf grows taller when bonemealed
-   If you stand on a big dripleaf it will tilt after a while and you will fall off
-   You can crouch or jump to prevent a big dripleaf from tilting
-   A tilted big drip leaf will tilt up again after a while
-   The big dripleaf will break when hit by a projectile
-   The wandering trader will sometimes sell small dripleaf plants

### Moss

-   Two new decorative blocks: Moss block and moss carpet
-   Moss carpet can be crafted from moss blocks

### Spore blossom

-   A beautiful large flower placed on ceilings
-   Particles drip from it

## Changes in 21w05a

-   The stonecutter can be used to craft the different copper block variants
-   The stages of copper oxidization are now called "Copper Block", "Exposed Copper Block", "Weathered Copper Block" and "Oxidized Copper Block" in sequence of least to most oxidized
-   Drowned now have a chance of dropping a copper ingot, they no longer drop gold ingots
-   Added new sculk sensor events
-   Changes to powder snow

### Sculk Sensor Changes

Added the following game events that the Sculk Sensor reacts to, along with corresponding frequency value:

Vibration Types

Frequency Value

Minecart Moving, Ring Bell, Block Change

6

Drinking Finish, Prime Fuse

7

Mob Interact

8

Equip, Shear, Ravager Roar

9

Entity Place

12

Entity Killed

13

Shulker Close

14

Shulker Open

15

-   `Block Change` is for when player or dispenser action has changed a block. Example: cake slice being eaten.
-   `Mob Interact` is for specific mob interaction events that cause vibrations.
-   `Prime Fuse` is for both TNT and Creepers.

### Powder Snow changes

-   Flaming arrows now get extinguished when they collide with Powder Snow
-   Skeletons now convert to Strays when frozen
-   Powder snow is now pushable by pistons and sticky pistons
-   Foxes can now walk on top of powder snow without falling in

## Technical Changes in 21w05a

-   Improved performance when using many overrides on an item model
-   Copper oxidization is now a random tick effect and thus affected by the randomTickSpeed game rule

## New Features in 21w03a

â€‹

-   Added Glow Lichen!
-   Added the Glow Squid!

â€‹

### Glow Lichen

-   A dim light source that generates in caves

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w51a

Ready your screenshot buttons and start rehearsing your best "naaaaww"s. The final snapshot of the year enters Minecraft Java, and what better way to end the year than with something that has been on our bucket list for quite a while: the adorable **axolotl**?

We hope you'll end the year on a good note, and the entirety of the Java team wishes you happy holidays.

## New Features in 20w51a

â€‹

-   Added the axolotl!

â€‹

### Axolotl

-   Amphibious!
-   Axolotls currently love tropical fish, though this may change. Tropical fish or tropical fish buckets can be used to mate axolotls
-   Axolotls will swim around with you if you're holding a tropical fish or tropical fish bucket in one of your hands
-   When a player kills a mob that the axolotl was attacking or being attacked by, the axolotl will show its appreciation by granting the player temporary regeneration and removing any mining fatigue effects
-   You can pick up your axolotl in a water bucket and carry it around just like a salmon or cod!
-   Axolotls will always chase after squids and other types of fish
-   Axolotls are skittish, but they will attack Drowned and Guardians if you tempt them with their favorite food - tropical fish!
-   Axolotls do not like it out of water, and will dry up and begin taking damage if they are out of water for longer than 5 minutes
-   An axolotl will not dry up as long as they are in water or rain
-   Sometimes when an axolotl takes damage, it will pretend to be dead so that it stops being attacked
-   There are 4 common varieties and 1 rare variety of axolotl
-   Axolotls do not spawn in the world yet, but you can find spawn eggs for them in the creative inventory

â€‹

## Changes in 20w51a

-   Bundles and shulker box items will now drop their items when destroyed
-   Some changes have been made to Sculk Sensors

â€‹

### Sculk Sensors

-   Eating Start has been removed as an event for a few reasons.
    -   It is inconsistent with our philosophy around vibrations. Mining a block is not considered a vibration because a physical event hasn't happened in the world yet (you can stop mining and the block will revert). This is the same for eating: you can start eating, but then stop and the food reverts as if eating never occurred.
    -   It wasn't widely considered to be a useful event for players to use Sculk Sensors with.
    -   Eating Finish is staying, and will likely be much more useful to Sculk Sensors for this scenario.
-   Walking on wool no longer causes vibrations.
-   Throwing wool as an item onto the ground no longer causes vibrations.
-   Sculk Sensors are now silent while waterlogged.

**Vibration Frequency Changes**

As we continue to consider feedback from the community, some changes to the frequency ranges have been made.

## Technical Changes in 20w51a

-   Added gamerule playersSleepingPercentage (100 by default), which sets what percentage of players must sleep to skip the night. Setting to 0 will mean 1 player is always enough to skip the night. Setting above 100 will prevent skipping the night.

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w49a

Another snapshot is going out, and this one introduces the Sculk. They're a bit creepy, but don't let that put you off. Pick up some good vibrations!

## New Features in 20w49a

-   Added Dripstone Caves biome
-   Added Sculk Sensors

### Dripstone Caves biome

This biome doesn't generate naturally yet, since it is designed for the upcoming larger caves. However, if you want to see the biome in the current caves you can create a single-biome world with dripstone caves.

-   Contains plenty of Pointed Dripstone on the floors and ceilings, and small pools of water
-   In some places you'll find larger stalagmites, stalactites, and columns built from Dripstone Blocks.

### Sculk Sensors

-   Introducing the bizarre, tendril-filled world of Sculk - prepare for Sculk Sensors to creep you out with their unique ability to detect vibrations nearby.
-   A vibration is anything that causes physical motion; if you are careful, there are some motions that are undetectable to sensors by sneaking.
    -   These sneak-friendly vibrations currently include walking, falling to the ground or throwing/shooting projectiles.
-   Sculk Sensors will not listen to vibrations that are directly created by other Sculk sources.
-   When a vibration is detected, a signal is sent from the source location to the sensor at a speed of 1 game tick per block.
    -   Other vibrations cannot be detected by a sensor when a signal is already travelling to it.
    -   When the signal has arrived, the sensor will be activated for 40 game ticks (approximately 2 seconds).
    -   While activated, the sensor cannot detect other vibrations.
-   Sculk Sensors can detect vibrations in an 8 block radius around it.
-   The efficient tool to mine Sculk Sensors is the Hoe.
-   They can be waterlogged.

**Redstone Emission**

-   Sculk Sensors emit a redstone signal when they are activated.
-   The strength of the redstone signal is inversely proportional to the distance the vibration signal travelled.
    -   This means that the closer the vibration is, the stronger the redstone signal is.
    -   The output is also scaled based on the Sculk Sensor's radius, so it can reach the max redstone signal strength when the vibration is 0 distance away (directly on top of the sensor).

**Vibration Frequencies**

-   Sculk Sensors have a unique interaction with comparators.
-   Each vibration in the game falls under a certain frequency value, and this value can be measured with a comparator.
-   With the right contraption, this allows you to detect when a certain action has occured nearby.

**Wool Occlusion**

-   Wool has a special interaction with Sculk Sensors.
-   If a wool block is in the way of a vibration source, the sensor will not be able to detect it.

**Technical Tidbits**

-   Sculk Sensors have a cooldown period of 1 tick after being placed or after deactivating.
-   During this short cooldown period, it cannot detect vibrations. This is to prevent it from activating itself when a contraption it is powering is being unpowered. Feedback is welcome on this point!

## Changes in 20w49a

-   The Fullness of a bundle now shows up regardless of whether Advanced Tooltips are on or off
-   Stalactites and stalagmites merge if the tips are next to each other, unless you press shift while placing

## Technical Changes in 20w49a

-   A new game event system has been implemented to support Sculk Sensors detecting vibrations.
-   World height related values are now exposed for customized worlds
-   Removed the `max-build-height` server setting
-   Added `occludes_vibration_signals` block tag. Anything in this tag will occlude vibrations, and inherits `wool` tag entries by default
-   New particle types: `vibration` and `dust_color_transition`
-   A new game event system has been implemented to support Sculk Sensors detecting vibrations.

### Game Events

This system has been developed to identify when certain in-world actions are happening in nearby chunks, particularly so the new Sculk Sensor can detect these events as vibrations.

The following is a list of the initial game events:

-   `minecraft:step`
-   `minecraft:swim`
-   `minecraft:flap`
-   `minecraft:elytra_free_fall`
-   `minecraft:hit_ground`
-   `minecraft:splash`
-   `minecraft:projectile_shoot`
-   `minecraft:projectile_land`
-   `minecraft:entity_hit`
-   `minecraft:block_place`
-   `minecraft:block_destroy`
-   `minecraft:fluid_place`
-   `minecraft:fluid_pickup`
-   `minecraft:block_open`
-   `minecraft:block_close`
-   `minecraft:block_switch`
-   `minecraft:block_unswitch`
-   `minecraft:block_attach`
-   `minecraft:block_detach`
-   `minecraft:block_press`
-   `minecraft:block_unpress`
-   `minecraft:container_open`
-   `minecraft:container_close`
-   `minecraft:explode`
-   `minecraft:armor_stand_add_item`
-   `minecraft:wolf_shaking`
-   `minecraft:dispense_fail`
-   `minecraft:fishing_rod_cast`
-   `minecraft:fishing_rod_reel_in`
-   `minecraft:piston_extend`
-   `minecraft:piston_contract`
-   `minecraft:flint_and_steel_use`
-   `minecraft:eating_start`
-   `minecraft:eating_finish`
-   `minecraft:lightning_strike`

**Tags**

There are also game event tags that come with this, and can be modified by data packs. They can be found under `data/minecraft/tags/game_events`.

-   `vibrations` Determines which game events are considered vibrations by the Sculk Sensor. Currently, all added game events are in this tag by default.
-   `ignore_vibrations_stepping_carefully` Which game events should be ignored by the Sculk Sensor when the source of the event is sneaking.

The following game events are in `ignore_vibrations_stepping_carefully` by default:

-   `minecraft:step`
-   `minecraft:hit_ground`
-   `minecraft:projectile_shoot`
