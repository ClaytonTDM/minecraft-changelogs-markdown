# Minecraft Snapshot 24w21a

This week we're bringing a Snapshot you can vibe out to! This time around we're bringing data-driven jukeboxes, a new gamerule, and a bunch of fixes.

Happy vibing!

## Changes

-   It seems we cooked a bit too hard with the new Piston sounds last week, which is why we're reverting back to the old sounds again
-   Lowered volume of original sounds to address initial feedback of Pistons being too loud
-   Pause menu now can include a list of links provided by server
-   Improvements to the disconnection screen
-   Any member of a Realm can now upgrade a world
-   In the Realms main screen, all online players of a Realm are displayed
    -   When hovered, a tooltip is shown with each player's head and name

### Vault

-   Added sound effect to help players understand they've already looted a vault

### Trial Chambers

-   Trial Chambers are less likely to generate in the Deep Dark

### Animal Panic

-   Animals now panic based on the damage caused by predefined Damage Source Types
-   The panic lasts for 2 seconds after the damage is dealt. The following damage type tags are used by vanilla animals:
    -   `panic_environmental_causes`: Used by Wolves, Polar Bears (adults) and Pandas
    -   `panic_causes`: Used by all other animals and baby Polar Bears

### Server links

-   Servers can now provide a list of links to clients
-   If client has received any links, a new button called "Server Links..." will show up in pause game screen
    -   To make space for that button, "Report Bugs" and "Give Feedback" buttons might be moved into a sub-screen if necessary

### Disconnection screen improvements

-   In some cases client will now store detailed information about disconnection (similar to crash reports)
-   When that happens, new "Open Disconnection Report Directory" button will be added to the disconnection screen
-   When server provides link for bug reporting, it will be also be added as a button to the disconnection screen

## Technical Changes

-   Resource Pack version is now 34
-   Data Pack version is now 45
-   Server can now provide list of links to client
-   Servers can add custom details to crash and disconnection reports

### Gamerules

-   Added new `entitiesWithPassengersCanUsePortals` gamerule
    -   When `true`, entities with passengers can use Nether Portals, End Portals and End Gateways
    -   Defaults to `false`

### Server links

-   New clientbound packet `server_links` is available in `configuration` and `game` protocols
-   On receival, client will make links available from pause menu
-   Link labels can be built-in or custom (i.e. any text)
-   Some built-ins also have special fuctionality:
    -   `report_bug`:
        -   link will be displayed on disconnection screen, if disconnection was caused by packet handling error
        -   link will be included as a comment in disconnection report
-   Added `bug-report-link` to `server.properties` to allow vanilla server to configure `report_bug` links
    -   If this field is non-empty, server will send that link to clients
    -   This field should contain well-formed URL

### Custom server crash report details

-   New clientbound packet `custom_report_details` is available in `configuration` and `game` protocols
-   This packet contains a list of key-value text entries
-   If received, contents of this packet will be added in a separate section to any crash or disconnection report generated during connection to this server

## Data Pack Version 45

-   Jukebox songs are now data-driven
-   Added new command syntax

### Jukebox Songs

-   Added a jukebox song registry which is loaded from data packs
-   Path to jukebox song definition is `data/<namespace>/jukebox_song/<id>.json`
-   Fields in definition:
    -   `sound_event` - sound event that is streamed when played by a Jukebox
    -   `description` - the name of the song that will be displayed in the hover tooltip represented as a Text Component
    -   `length_in_seconds` - length of the song in seconds as a positive float
    -   `comparator_output` - the redstone signal output by a comparator when played in a Jukebox, between 0 and 15
-   Added `minecraft:jukebox_playable` item stack component

#### `jukebox_playable` item component

-   If set, the item can be inserted into Jukeboxes to play a song
-   Format: object with fields
    -   `song`: jukebox song id
        -   The song that will be played by the Jukebox when this item stack is inserted
    -   `show_in_tooltip`: boolean (default: true)
        -   If false, the name of the song will not be shown in the tooltip
        -   This was formerly controlled by the `hide_additional_tooltip` component on Music Discs
    -   e.g. `jukebox_playable={song:'minecraft:precipice'}`, `jukebox_playable={song:'minecraft:precipice', show_in_tooltip:false}`

### Attributes

-   Attribute modifiers no longer have a UUID and name combination
-   Instead, attribute modifiers are now uniquely identified by a namespaced ID, similar to other resources
-   The ID of a modifier uniquely identifies it in the set of modifiers for a single attribute
    -   Using the same ID for different modifiers is allowed as long as the modifiers are for different attributes
-   Existing built-in modifiers will be upgraded to new IDs
-   Existing custom modifiers will be upgraded to the GUID as an ID in the `minecraft` namespace

#### `attribute` command

-   The `uuid` and `name` arguments have been replaced with a singular `id` argument

#### Item Stack Attribute Modifiers

-   The `uuid` and `name` fields have been removed.
-   Attribute Modifiers now have an `id` (namespaced ID) field
    -   This is a unique identifier per attribute for the modifier

#### Entity Attributes

-   Attributes are now stored as `attributes`
-   Attribute format:
    -   `id`, renamed from `Name`
    -   `base`, renamed from `Base`
    -   `modifiers`, renamed from `Modifiers`
        -   Now stores modifiers in the same format as modifiers in `attribute_modifiers` item stack components:
            -   `id`, replaces `UUID` and `Name`
            -   `amount`, renamed from `Amount`
            -   `operation`, renamed from `Operation`, now a named constant instead of an int:
                -   `add_value` - previously `0`
                -   `add_multiplied_base` - previously `1`
                -   `add_multiplied_total` - previously `2`

### Enchantments

#### Attribute Effects

Fields:

-   `name` & `uuid` have been removed, replaced by `id`
-   `id`: The namespaced ID of the Attribute Modifier to add
    -   This will be postfixed with the slot name when the enchanted item is equipped in a slot
    -   Must be unique to avoid different Enchantments (or other systems) interfering with each others

#### Entity Effect Types

##### `damage_item`

The damage is not applied to items held by players in creative mode.

##### Hit Block Parameters

-   Entities: `this`
-   Enchantment Level
-   Origin
-   Block State

#### Effect Components

-   `minecraft:hit_block`:
    -   Condition Context: changed to take a Hit Block Parameter - `this` is the entity hitting the Block

### Tags

#### Directory renames

-   Some registry types that used legacy datapack directory names (based on plural name of element) have been renamed to match registry name
-   Affected directories:
    -   `structures` -> `structure`
    -   `advancements` -> `advancement`
    -   `recipes` -> `recipe`
    -   `loot_tables` -> `loot_table`
    -   `predicates` -> `predicate`
    -   `item_modifiers` -> `item_modifier`
    -   `functions` -> `function`
    -   `tags/functions` -> `tags/function`

#### Item Tags

-   Removed `music_discs` item tag

#### Block Tags

-   `air`: All blocks that resemble air

#### Damage Type Tags

-   Removed `breeze_immune_to` damage type tag
-   Added `panic_environmental_causes`: Damage types that cause panic in aggressive animals that can panic, i.e. mobs that retaliate when attacked
-   Added `panic_causes`: Damage types that cause panic in passive animals, i.e. mobs that run away when attacked

### Predicates

#### Jukebox Playable Predicate

New item sub-predicate available as `jukebox_playable`.

-   Matcher for `jukebox_playable` component (like Music Discs)
-   Fields:
    -   `song` - optional id, list of ids or tag for jukebox song to be matched

#### Player Predicate

-   The `gamemode` field has been changed to accept a list of gamemodes

### Commands

-   Added `@n` entity selector, selecting the nearest entity
    -   This functions as `@e[sort=nearest,limit=1]`
    -   Additional requirements may still be provided; for example: `@n[type=pig]` will select the closest Pig

## Resource Pack Version 34

-   Added the `block.vault.reject_rewarded_player` sound event
-   Changes to Shaders

### Shaders

-   The `blend` block in core shader definitions has been removed, as it was not used

-   The `glint_direct` shader has been removed, replaced with the pre-existing `glint` shader
-   The `armor_glint` shader has been removed, as it was unused

After some recent irregularities in our Snapshot schedule (public holidays, we're looking at you!) we're back to shipping on a Wednesday! Among other things, 24w20a includes a buff to the amount of Redstone Dust dropped by Witches, as well as a long requested change to make Piston sounds a tad more pleasing to the ear. We're also throwing 41 new bug fixes into the mix, because we like squashing bugs.

Happy mining!

## Changes

-   Witches now always drop 4-8 redstone dust on death
    -   This is to improve the viability of farms that utilize Witch Huts to obtain Redstone Dust
-   Improved player attribute and effect handling
    -   Custom set base attributes are now kept when respawning
    -   Active effects and modifiers are kept when changing dimension or winning the game
-   Updated credits

### Sounds

-   Updated Piston sounds to lower volume and attenuation
    -   This was done to address the long-received feedback on the old sounds being too harsh and loud, creating very noisy redstone builds

## Technical Changes

-   Data Pack version is now 44

## Data Pack Version 44

-   `dimension_padding` jigsaw structure NBT tag was changed
    -   Now it is an object with fields:
        -   `bottom` the vertical padding at the bottom of the dimension, non-negative integer
        -   `top` the vertical padding at the top of the dimension, non-negative integer
    -   Can be written as a single non-negative integer instead to be applied to both top and bottom fields
        -   e.g. both `dimension_padding: 10` or `dimension_padding: { bottom: 10, top: 5 }` are valid
-   Data-driven enchantment field `weight` now has an upper bound of 1024
-   Data-driven enchantment field `max_level` now has an upper bound of 255

### Predicates

#### Entity Predicate

-   New option: `movement_affected_by` - optional Location Predicate
    -   When present, adds requirements on a block at most 0.5 blocks below the entity which can affect its movement

---

The weekend is right around the corner, and what better way to celebrate that fact than by bringing you a serving of Snapshot Friday? This one rounds off the week by introducing performance improvements to chunk loading, alongside the usual assortment of technical improvements and bug fixes.

On another note, last week's Snapshot introduced some changes to the Mace that went undocumented in the 24w18a changelog. That was a whoopsie on our end, and to clear up any confusion we've decided to add those changes to this changelog in addition to updating the previous one. We're sorry about that!

Happy mining!

## Mace changes from 24w18a

-   Raised Mace durability from 250 to 500
-   Reduced Mace base damage to 5
-   Lower the Mace attack speed from -2.4 to -3.5
-   Reduced Density damage per level per block to 0.5
-   Mace Smash attack damage now has a fall off:
    -   First 3 blocks fallen give 4 damage per block
    -   Next 5 blocks fallen give 2 damage per block
    -   Any block fallen after that give 1 damage per block
-   Density and Breach are now incompatible with each other and the other damage enchantments (Smite and Bane of Arthropods)

## Changes

-   Blocks frozen by Frost Walker now emit "Block Placed" vibrations (frequency 13)
-   Changes to sounds
-   Improved chunk loading performance

### Sounds

-   Added 4 new cave ambient sounds
-   Replaced turn off and turn on sounds for Copper Bulb with one toggle sound

### Chunk loading improvements

-   When reading an already generated chunk from disk, surrounding chunks are no longer unnecessarily loaded
    -   This is also visible on the singleplayer world loading screen
-   The new system has less memory and CPU overhead

## Technical Changes

-   Data Pack version is now 43

## Data Pack Version 43

-   The `custom_data` component can now be specified as an SNBT string to preserve type information in JSON
    -   This is the same as is used in the `set_custom_data` loot function and `custom_data` predicate
-   The `food` item component has new fields:
    -   `using_converts_to`: item with components (optional)
        -   Once consumed, the food item will be replaced with the specified item
        -   e.g. `food={nutrition:1,saturation:0,using_converts_to:{id:"poisonous_potato",components:{"minecraft:custom_name":'"Wait what?"'}}}`
-   Registry `decorated_pot_patterns` has been renamed to `decorated_pot_pattern`
-   Removed legacy tag directory names
-   Removed `power` NBT tag and replaced with `acceleration_power` tag with a number value that contol the projectiles acceleration (and maximum speed)
    -   This change affects the following projectiles; `dragon_fireball`, `large_fireball`, `small_fireball`, `fireball`, `breeze_wind_charge`, `wind_charge`, `wither_skull`
-   New NBT tag `dimension_padding` for structures
    -   ensures that a structure is not generating through the edges of a dimension by adding vertical padding to its bounding box
    -   default is 0
    -   Trial Chambers have a padding of 10 since they are generated deep underground and sometimes would intersect with Bedrock layer

### Enchantments

#### Entity Effect Types

-   Added field `trigger_game_event` for effect types `replace_block`, `replace_disc` and `set_block_properties`
    -   Format: Optional Game Event ID for a game event to trigger when a block has been replaced

### Tags

Because it's the month of May, may we tempt you with the first Snapshot for Java Edition 1.21? This one looks as excellent as it sounds, thanks to the 20 new paintings and 3 new music discs it adds to the game. And we're not stopping there, data-driven enchantments are also being thrown into the fray with this Snapshot (hence the 900+ line changelog). We also included a batch of new bug fixes for good measure.

### Enchantments

Enchantments are now set through data. An Enchantment is a set of core properties like level ranges and cost together with some effects. Most effect types also support a set of conditions, making it possible to apply them only when certain criteria are met.

Enchantments can be added in the registry `enchantment`. All Vanilla Enchantments can be found in the vanilla datapack in the client and server jar files.

Fields:

-   `description`: The name of the Enchantment when displayed in text represented as a Text Component
-   `exclusive_set`: The Enchantment(s) this Enchantment is exclusive with
    -   Two Enchantments can never co-exist on an item if either is in the other's exclusive set
    -   Specified as an Enchantment ID, a list of Enchantment IDs or an Enchantment Tag prefixed with `#`
    -   Optional - if omitted, the exclusive set is empty
-   `supported_items`: The item types that can have this Enchantment
    -   Item ID, list of item IDs or tag prefixed with `#`
-   `primary_items`: The item types for which this Enchantment shows up in Enchanting Tables and on traded equipment
    -   Item ID, list of item IDs or tag prefixed with `#`
    -   Must be a subset of `supported_items`
-   `weight`: How commonly the Enchantment appears, compared to the total combined `weight` of all available Enchantments
    -   Positive integer - higher values mean more common
-   `max_level`: The maximum level of the Enchantment
    -   All Enchantments range from level 1 to their maximum level
    -   Positive integer
-   `min_cost`, `max_cost`: describe the range of costs for this Enchantment in the Enchanting Table (and how much it returns when disenchanted)
    -   Both min and max cost are described using a linear formula:
    -   `base`: Base cost at level 1
    -   `per_level_above_first`: Added for each level over 1
-   `anvil_cost`: The fee taken for the Enchantment in the anvil
    -   Non-negative integer
    -   This value is halved when an Enchantment is added to a book
    -   The effective fee is multiplied by the level of the Enchantment
-   `slots`: A list of slot groups this Enchantment works in
    -   Each entry is one of `any`, `hand`, `mainhand`, `offhand`, `armor`, `feet`, `legs`, `chest`, `head` and `body`
-   `effects`: A map of effect components, as described below in the Effect Components section

#### Level-Based Values

Many effects of Enchantments depend on the level of the Enchantment. For these fields, a type called Level-Based Values is used. In their most basic form, Level-Based Values can be written as floating-point constants, which is interpreted as a value that isn't in fact level-based, the constant is used as-is for all levels.

If a Level-Based value is not a floating-point constant, it is an object with a `type` field, specifying one of the following types.

##### `linear`

The most common type of Level-Based Value is a `linear` value. A `linear` Level-Based Value has two fields:

-   `base`: The base value added to all levels
-   `per_level_above_first`: Amount added for each level above the first one

In effect, a `linear` Level-Based Value results in `base + per_level_above_first * (level - 1)`.

##### `clamped`

A Level-Based Value type that clamps a value between a min and max. Fields:

-   `value`: A Level-Based Value used as the input
-   `min`: A floating point value specifying the minimum value of the output
-   `max`: A floating point value specifying the maximum value of the output

##### `fraction`

A Level-Based Value type that represents the fraction between two values. Fields:

-   `numerator`: A Level-Based Value used as the numerator
-   `denominator`: A Level-Based Value used as the denominator

##### `levels_squared`

A Level-Based Value type that evaluates to the square of the levels, plus an addition. Fields:

-   `added`: A floating-point value added to the result of the squared levels

In effect, a `levels_squared` Level-Based Value results in `level ^ 2 + added`

#### Value Effect Types

Value Effects are effects used to manipulate the amount of _something_ in the game.

##### `add`

A Value Effect that adds a value to the processed results.

Fields:

-   `value`: A Level-Based Value determining how much to add
    -   Negative values are supported

##### `all_of`

A Value Effect that runs a number of other Value Effects, in order. This can be useful when the same set of conditions apply to a number of Value Effects.

Fields:

-   `effects`: A list of the Value Effects to run

##### `multiply`

A Value Effect that multiplies the processed value by a given factor.

Fields:

-   `factor`: A Level-Based Value determining the factor to multiply in

##### `remove_binomial`

A Value Effect that runs a Binomial series of checks, reducing the input value by 1 for every successful check.

Fields:

-   `chance`: A Level-Based Value representing the chance that an input value is dropped.
    -   The span is 0 to 1, with 0 being no chance to drop an input value and 1 dropping all input values

##### `set`

A Value Effect that overwrites the input value with a given Level-Based Value.

Fields:

-   `value`: The Level-Based Value to use as the result

#### Attribute Effects

Attribute effects use the Attribute system to apply an Attribute Modifier whenever the Enchanted Item is correctly equipped. Attribute effects do not have a dynamic type - they are all the same type.

Fields:

-   `name`: The name of the Attribute Modifier to add
-   `attribute`: The ID of the attribute to modify
-   `operation`: The operation of the Attribute Modifier
    -   One of `add_value`, `add_multiplied_base` and `add_multiplied_total`
-   `amount`: A Level-Based Value describing the amount
-   `uuid`: A string containing a UUID for the Attribute Modifier to use
    -   Must be unique to avoid different Enchantments (or other systems) interfering with each others

#### Entity Effect Types

Entity Effects are Enchantment effects that generally do something to an Entity involved in an event. Which Entity is affected depends on the specific component being configured.

##### `all_of`

An Entity Effect that runs a list of other Entity Effects. This can be useful when a set of conditions should apply to more than one Entity Effect.

Fields:

-   `effects`: List of Entity Effects to run

##### `apply_mob_effect`

An Entity Effect that applies a random Mob Effect to the affected Entity, chosen from a set of options. The duration and amplifier are randomized within a given span. The effect of specifying larger maximum values than the minimum value is undefined.

    -   One of an Effect ID, a list of Effect IDs or an Effect Tag prefixed by `#`
-   `min_duration`, `max_duration`: Level-Based Values representing the minimum and maximum duration of the effect in seconds
-   `min_amplifier`, `max_amplifier`: Level-Based Values representing the minimum and maximum amplifier

##### `damage_entity`

An Entity Effect that applies damage to the affected Entity. The amount of damage is randomized within a given span. The effect of specifying a larger maximum value than the minimum value is undefined.

Fields:

-   `damage_type`: The ID of the Damage Type to use
-   `min_damage`, `max_damage`: Level-Based Values representing the minimum and maximum amount of damage

##### `damage_item`

An Entity Effect that applies damage to the Enchanted Item.

Fields:

All Entity Effect types can also be used as Location-Based Effects, and in addition `attribute` can be used to specify an Attribute Effect as a location-based effect.

#### Effect Conditions

Most Enchantment effects are filtered using Conditions (same types as in loot tables). This enables effects to be specific for different situations. Each Effect Component defines which parameters are available for the condition to evaluate - some parameters are available for all of these parameter sets, while some are specific to a certain set.

Each effect component specifies which parameters are available in the [Effect Components](#effect-components) list below.

##### Damage Parameters

-   Entities: `this`, `attacker`, `direct_attacker`

-   Origin
-   Damage Source

##### Item Parameters

#### Effect Components

The `effects` field in an Enchantment is a map of Effect Component type the Effect List data. Most Effect Components are lists, so any number of Effects can be added of any Component Type. The data for each effect generally involves having a specified condition context and Effect Type, but some Effects also deviate from this format.

In cases where the documentation specifies a Condition Context and Effect, the Component is a list. Each entry in the list has a field named `effect` with the effect of the type used by the list. Entries can also optionally include a field named `requirements` specifying the condition parameters, which are then evaluated with the documented context.

This fine Wednesday brings 24w13a, a snapshot containing changes to the Mace, Trial Chambers, and introduces the new Ominous Trials!

You might just be inclined to try out the ominous new features of this snapshot. ...or else? Did I do that right?

Happy mining!

Note: some of the features below will only work in freshly generated Trial Chambers.

## Experimental Features

-   Changes to the Mace
-   Tweaks to the Breeze and Wind Charges
-   Redesigned Bad Omen
-   Added Ominous Bottle
-   Added 6 new mob effects
-   Added Ominous Trial Spawner
-   Added Ominous Vault
-   Added Ominous Trial Key

### Mace

-   Added a new explosive particle effect when executing a smash attack with the Mace to really show the player's power
-   Increased the power and range of the knockback effect from a smash attack
-   Introduced an even stronger knockback when falling for more than 5 blocks before attacking
-   When successfully striking a target, all vertical momentum will be reset in addition to negating any accumulated fall distance
-   The baseline additional damage dealt by the Mace smash attack has been slightly reduced to 3 (1.5 hearts) per fallen block
-   These existing enchantments can now be applied to the Mace:
    -   Mending
    -   Unbreaking
    -   Smite
    -   Bane of Arthropods
    -   Fire Aspect
    -   Curse of Vanishing
-   Three new enchantments have been introduced that are unique to the Mace:
    -   Density:
        -   Common Enchantment, accessible in the Enchanting Table and on Enchanted Books in loot
        -   Has 5 levels
        -   Maces enchanted with Density do more damage per fallen block per Density level
            -   Damage dealt per fallen block is increased by 1 per level of Density
    -   Breach:
        -   Rare Enchantment, accessible in the Enchanting Table and on Enchanted Books in loot
        -   Has 4 levels
        -   Maces enchanted with Breach reduce the effectiveness of armor on the target
            -   The effectiveness of the armor is reduced by 15% per Breach level
    -   Wind Burst:
        -   Unique enchantment which can only be found in Ominous Vaults
        -   Has 3 levels
        -   Maces enchanted with Wind Burst will emit a Wind Burst upon hitting an enemy, launching the attacker upward and enabling the linking of smash attacks one after the other
        -   Each level will bounce the attacker higher up in the air

### Breeze & Wind Charges

-   The Breeze now avoids jumping into dangerous blocks or air
-   Wind Charges no longer collide with End Crystals

### Ominous Events

-   Bad Omen has been expanded to give access to an optional experience in Trial Chambers
-   These optional experiences accessed through Bad Omen are now known as Ominous Events
    -   They are more challenging than usual, and are designed to shake up the experience in unique ways
    -   Illager Raids are an example of an existing Ominous Event
-   Bad Omen is getting some changes with this redesign:
    -   It has a new, shadowy icon and a sound for being applied to the player
    -   It no longer triggers a Raid directly when entering a village
        -   Instead, it will transform into a Raid Omen variant with a duration of 30 seconds
        -   Once the Raid Omen expires, a Raid will start at the location the player gained the Raid Omen
        -   Like any other effect, players can drink a Bucket of Milk to clear the Raid Omen to prevent the Raid from starting
    -   It is no longer given to players that defeat a Raid Captain outside a Raid
        -   Instead, players can gain access to Bad Omen by consuming a new Ominous Bottle

#### Ominous Bottle

-   An item which can be consumed by players to receive the Bad Omen effect for 1 hour and 40 minutes
    -   Comes in 5 variations, one for each Bad Omen level
    -   The bottle breaks when consumed
    -   Can be stacked to 64
-   Can be found uncommonly in any Vaults that are unlocked with Trial Keys, and is dropped by Raid Captains when defeated outside a Raid

### Ominous Trials

-   A new Ominous Event that can be accessed by exploring a Trial Chamber with Bad Omen
-   This event will have players facing more powerful Trial Spawners if they dare!

#### Trial Omen

-   A variant that Bad Omen can transform into
    -   This occurs when the player is within detection range of a Trial Spawner that is not Ominous
    -   The Trial Omen has a duration of 15 minutes multiplied by the transformed Bad Omen's level
-   Players that have Trial Omen are surrounded by ominous particles

#### Ominous Trial Spawner

-   A more powerful active phase of the Trial Spawner with unique challenges and rewards
    -   Provides a more challenging experience that advanced players can opt into for better rewards
-   If a Trial Spawner detects a player that has the Trial Omen effect, the spawner will become Ominous if:
    -   It is not in cooldown
    -   Or, it is in cooldown but was not Ominous during its last activation
        -   Making it Ominous this way will bypass the cooldown
-   While active, it will:
    -   Glow blue instead of orange
    -   Emit soul flames instead of normal flames
    -   Very commonly spawns mobs with equipment if they can wear it
        -   The equipment these mobs wear have armor trims applied from the Trial Chambers
        -   Known issue: these mobs can currently drop their equipment on death, but they will not in the future
    -   Periodically spawn potions and projectiles on top of unsuspecting players and mobs
        -   Based on their location, spawners in an area will select a random set of projectiles to spawn
        -   These projectiles will always include a single type of Lingering Potion from a set of possible effects
-   Becoming Ominous will despawn any existing mobs it spawned and reset its challenge
    -   It will stay Ominous until it has been defeated and its cooldown has finished
-   When defeated, it will eject a different set of loot to normal Trial Spawners

#### Ominous Trial Key

-   A new variant of the Trial Key which can only be obtained by defeating an Ominous Trial Spawner
-   They can be used to unlock Ominous Vaults

#### Ominous Vault

-   A variant of Vaults that have a different texture and emit soul flames instead of normal flames
-   These can be found throughout the Trial Chambers in harder to find places and require an Ominous Trial Key to unlock
    -   These Vaults hold a more valuable set of rewards than the standard Vaults unlocked by Trial Keys

### Mob Effects

-   The following effects have been added:
    -   Wind Charged
        -   Affected entities will emit a wind burst upon death
        -   Brewed with an Awkward Potion and a Breeze Rod
    -   Weaving
        -   Affected entities will spread Cobweb blocks upon death
        -   Non-player entities with this effect can walk through Cobweb at normal speeds
        -   Brewed with an Awkward Potion and a Cobweb block
    -   Oozing
        -   Affected entities will spawn two Slimes upon death
        -   Brewed with an Awkward Potion and a Slime Block
    -   Infested
        -   Affected entities have a 5% chance to spawn 1-2 Silverfish when hurt
        -   Brewed with an Awkward Potion and a Stone block
-   These effects can be encountered while taking on an Ominous Trial Spawner
-   Some mobs are immune to these effects
    -   Slimes are immune to Oozing
    -   Silverfish are immune to Infested

### Trial Chambers Loot

-   The loot found within Trial Chamber Vaults has been adjusted
-   Standard Vaults will give slightly less items of high quality, but also include the following changes:
    -   Ominous Bottle I - II can be found
    -   Flow Banner Pattern, Flow Armor Trim Smithing Template, and Heavy Core can no longer be obtained
        -   Guster Banner Pattern and Bolt Armor Trim Smithing Template remain exclusive to standard Vaults
        -   In Heavy Core's place, standard Vaults will instead have a very rare chance of providing a Trident
-   Ominous Vaults can provide some particularly valuable items, to mention a few:
    -   Ominous Bottle III - V
    -   Enchanted Golden Apple
    -   Flow Banner Pattern and Flow Armor Trim Smithing Template
    -   Wind Burst, Breach and Density Enchantments for the Mace
    -   Heavy Core
-   The loot ejected from Trial Spawners have been adjusted
    -   It now has a focus on providing higher quality food more often to make replenishing between fights more safe
-   Ominous Trial Keys have a 30% chance of ejecting from a defeated Ominous Trial Spawner, replacing the usual 50% chance to eject Trial Keys

### Trial Spawner

-   All spawners now increase the amount of mobs present at once by 0.5 for each additional player, down from 2
-   Baby Zombie spawners now only have 2 mobs present at once for its baseline, down from 3 mobs
-   Can now only activate when a player is in line of sight

### Trial Chambers

-   Remade `chamber_5` with variations, and renamed it to `eruption`
-   Reduced amount of Trial Spawners in corridors
-   Updated layout and placements of Vaults
-   Placed Ominous Vaults in chambers, intersections, at the ends of corridors
-   Corridors will no longer generate endlessly
-   Added an atrium to the corridors
-   Made various layout changes in intersections and corridors

Known issues:

-   Corner quadrants in slanted may still fail to generate correctly

## Changes in 24w13a

-   Added unique sounds for Cobwebs

## Technical Changes in 24w13a

-   The Data Pack version is now 37
-   The Resource Pack version is now 31
-   Client chat state is now preserved by default when entering configuration phase
-   Changes to chat network protocol

### Chat

-   Client chat state (on-screen messages and chat input history) is now preserved by client when entering and exiting configuration phase
-   Message signature chain handling remains unchanged - going into configuration phase starts new session
-   If client has message delay configured, pending messages will be delivered immediately before leaving world
-   Server can clear chat state by sending `reset_chat` packet in configuration phase

### Network Protocol

-   The `minecraft:chat_command_signed` packet has been split from `minecraft:chat_command`
    -   Commands that do not accept any signed arguments will use the unsigned packet, and will not pass any 'last seen' chat updates

## Data Pack Version 37

-   Added new loot table type `minecraft:equipment`
    -   Has required parameters of `this_entity` and `origin`
        -   `this_entity` : the mob that is about to be given equipment
        -   `origin` : the position of the mob
-   Added optional `equipment_loot_table` to the spawn data present in the `SpawnPotentials` of Monster Spawners and `spawn_potentials` of Trial Spawner configs
    -   If present, rolled items from the specified loot table will be equipped to the mob that spawns
-   Modified `copy_components` and `set_name` loot function arguments
-   Added new `set_ominous_bottle_amplifier` loot function
-   Added new item components
-   Non-default components on item stacks are now stored when block entity is placed
-   Int and float providers used in worldgen definitions are no longer wrapped in an extra `value` field next to `type`
    -   For example, `{"type":"minecraft:uniform","value":{"min_inclusive":0.0,"max_inclusive":1.0}}` becomes `{"type":"minecraft:uniform","min_inclusive":0.0,"max_inclusive":1.0}`
-   New Damage Type Tag: `minecraft:is_player_attack` for attacks performed by the player
-   New Entity Type Tags:
    -   `immune_to_oozing` For entities that cannot receive the Oozing mob effect
    -   `immune_to_infested` For entities that cannot receive the Infested mob effect
-   Added `raider` sub entity predicate

### Block entities

Non-default components on item stacks containing block items are now stored on block entities when placed

-   Component removals from defaults are currently not preserved
-   Placing and breaking non-block entity blocks remains unchanged - nothing is preserved
-   Does not automatically cause preserved components to be restored on drops - this requires addition of `copy_components` function to loot table
-   Components are stored in field called `components`
    -   Some components (like `custom_name`) are still handled by legacy serialization, which means they might not be present in there
    -   Contains map of component id to component value

### New Item Stack Components

#### `minecraft:item_name`

-   When present, replaces default item name with contained chat component
-   Differences from `custom_name`:
    -   `item_name` can't be changed or removed in anvil
    -   `item_name` is not styled with italics when displayed to player
    -   `item_name` does not show labels where applicable (for example: banner markers, names in item frames)

#### `minecraft:ominous_bottle_amplifier`

-   Controls the amplifier amount for an Ominous Bottle's bad omen effect
-   Format: integer between 0 and 4
    -   e.g. `ominous_bottle_amplifier=3`

### Loot Functions

#### `copy_components`

Removed field `components` and replaced it with:

-   `include` - optional list of data components to be copied from source
    -   if omitted, all components present are included
-   `exclude` - optional list of data components to be excluded from copying
    -   if omitted, defaults to empty
-   Only components that are included (explicitly or implicitly) but not excluded will be copied

#### `set_name`

Added optional field `target` to specify which name should be set

-   Values:
    -   `custom_name` - sets `custom_name` component (default)
    -   `item_name` - sets `item_name` component

#### Added `set_ominous_bottle_amplifier`

Sets the `ominous_bottle_amplifier` component on the target item according to a number provider.

-   `conditions`: list of conditions to filter this function
-   `amplifier`: a number provider used to generate the `ominous_bottle_amplifier` component

#### Entity sub-predicates

##### `raider`

New `raider` sub-predicate has been added to match raiders Fields:

-   `has_raid` - Match whether the raider is in an active raid

Here's snapshot 24w12a with new advancements and several tweaks.

Happy Mining!

## Experimental Features

### Trial Chambers

Trial Chambers now generate slightly more rarely and a bit more spaced out from each other

### Trial Chambers Explorer Map

-   Struggle no more to locate a Trial Chamber - level up your nearest Cartographer to Journeyman for the opportunity to trade for an Explorer Map pointing to a nearby Trial Chamber

### Heavy Core

-   Can now be waterlogged
-   Survives lava flows
-   Most efficient tool is now the pickaxe
-   Adjusted destroy time and explosion resistance

### Advancements

-   Added the following advancements:
    -   `Minecraft: Trial(s) Edition` - Step foot in a Trial Chamber
    -   `Under Lock & Key` - Unlock a Vault using a Trial Key
    -   `[Challenge - 40 exp] Blowback` - Kill a Breeze with a deflected Wind Charge
    -   `Who Needs Rockets?` - Use a Wind Charge to launch yourself upward at least 8 blocks
    -   `Crafters Crafting Crafters` - Be near a Crafter when it crafts a Crafter
    -   `Lighten Up` - Scrape a Copper Bulb with an Axe to make it brighter
    -   `Over-Overkill` - Deal 50 hearts of damage in a single hit using the Mace

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 36
-   The Resource Pack version is now 30
-   -   Particle `entity_effect` takes color argument when spawned from command
    -   `/particle entity_effect <r> <g> <b> <a>`
    -   4 float values ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 representing RGBA

## Data Pack Version 36

-   Added a `crafter_recipe_crafted` trigger which is triggered when a Crafter ejects a successfully crafted item into the world.
    -   `<player>` an entity predicate matching the player who is nearby
    -   `<recipe_id>` is the ID of the recipe being crafted
    -   `<ingredients>` is a list of item predicates matching the ingredients that form the recipe being crafted
-   Added a `fall_after_explosion` trigger which is triggered when a player begins falling after being knocked upwards by an explosion or wind burst
    -   `<player>` an entity predicate matching the player who is falling
    -   `<start_position>` a location predicate matching the position the player was at when they were hit by the explosion or burst
    -   `<distance>` a distance predicate matching how far the player must be from `start_position` to cause the trigger to activate
    -   `<cause>` an entity predicate matching the entity which caused the explosion or burst to happen
-   Added `storage` loot number provider to access values from command storage
-   New Entity Type Tag: `sensitive_to_smite` - for Entity Types that take extra damage from the Smite Enchantment
-   Expanded item predicate syntax used in `execute if|unless items` and `clear` commands
-   Removed redundant custom data section (`{...}`) from item arguments (it's fully replaced by `[custom_data={...}]`)
    -   To make this transition easier, `custom_data` item sub-predicate has been changed to allow unquoted SNBT
-   Added `wolf` entity sub-predicate for matching wolf variants
-   `wolf`, `cat`, `frog` and `painting` entity sub-predicates now accept tags and plain lists instead of just single elements
-   Changed texture asset paths in `wolf_variant` to better match other formats
-   Command arguments that previously accepted namespaced ids of loot tables, modifiers and predicates can now also accept inline definitions
-   Added new item stack components
-   Added new loot functions

### `wolf_variant` definitions

-   Field `texture` has been renamed to `wild_texture`
-   `wild_texture`, `tame_texture` and `angry_texture` no longer require values to be prefixed with `textures/` and suffixed with `.png`

### Commands

#### Inline loot values

Arguments in following commands that previously accepted namespaced ids of loot tables, modifiers and predicates can now also accept inline definitions:

-   `loot`
-   `item`
-   `execute if predicate` Values have same structure as matching JSON files, though they are encoded as SNBT. Example: `execute if predicate {condition:weather_check, raining:true}`

### Loot tables

#### `storage` number provider

-   This number provider is able to access numeric values from command storage directly
-   If selected storage does not exist or tag selected by path is not numeric or does not exist, provider returns 0
-   Fields:
    -   `storage` - namespaced id of command storage
    -   `path` - NBT path to field

#### `set_lore` function

-   The `replace` field has been removed
-   Now has `mode` like `set_fireworks` and `set_written_book_pages`

#### `set_written_book_pages` function

-   `pages` is now a JSON Object rather than a string containing JSON

#### `toggle_tooltips` loot function

-   This function can be used to modify item component tooltip visiblity
-   It works by setting fields like `show_in_tooltip` without changing other values
-   Format:
    -   `toggles` - a map of supported item component type to boolean value
-   Supported components: `trim`, `dyed_color`, `enchantments`, `stored_enchantments`, `unbreakable`, `can_break`, `can_place_on`, `attribute_modifiers`
-   Example:
    -   `{function:"toggle_tooltips","toggles":{"enchantments":false}}` will hide enchantments tooltip

#### Functions

-   Nested lists are no longer supported in function lists

### Item predicate argument

The item predicate syntax (used in `execute if|unless items` and `clear` commands) has been significantly expanded.

-   The general syntax is: `<type> [comma-separated list of <test>]`
-   `<type>` can be one of:
    -   item id
    -   item tag id prefixed with `#`
    -   `*` to match any item
-   `<test>` can have one of 3 forms:
    -   `<component_id>=<value>` - match exact value of component (same as in previous format)
        -   `<value>` is a representation of component value in SNBT format (same as in `item give` argument)
    -   `<component_id>` - check if component exists
    -   `<predicate_id>~<value>` - check item sub-predicate
        -   `<value>` is a representation of item sub-predicate in SNBT format (but otherwise same as one used for advancement and loot table JSON files)
        -   Example: `*[damage~{durability:{min:3}}]` will match any stack with at least 3 uses left
-   The special name `minecraft:count` can be used for matching the stack size
    -   `count=<positive int>` will pass only when the stack size equals the given value
    -   `count~<int range>` will pass when the stack size is in the specified range
        -   Example: `*[count~{max:2}]` will match any stack with count <= 2
    -   `count` will always pass
-   Any `<test>` entry can be negated by prefixing with `!`
    -   Example: `*[!count=1]` will match any stack that has count other than 1
-   `<test>` elements can be also joined with `|` to check multiple alternatives
    -   Example: `*[!damage|damage=0]` will look for items without damage component or with `0` damage
-   The syntax for custom data partial matching (`{}`) has been removed in favor of using `custom_data` predicates
    -   So `stick{a:2}` becomes `stick[custom_data~{a:2}]`

### Predicates

#### Item sub-predicates

-   Predicate `minecraft:custom_data` now accepts both SNBT data written as a string (existing format) and unflattened tags
    -   That means that `*[custom_data~{a:1}]` and `*[custom_data~"{a:1}"]` are equivalent
    -   Flattened string format has been kept since NBT type information can't be expressed in JSON

#### Entity sub-predicates

##### `wolf`

New `wolf` sub-predicate has been added to match wolf variants Fields:

-   `variant` - wolf variant to match (single entry, list of entries or tag)

##### `cat`, `frog`, `painting`

-   Field `variant` now accepts single entries, list of entries or tags

### New Item Stack Components

#### `minecraft:food`

        -   `blocks`: single block, list of blocks, or `#`\-prefixed block tag to match
        -   `speed` (optional): float, overrides the mining speed if present and matched
        -   `correct_for_drops` (optional): boolean, overrides whether this tool is considered 'correct' if present and matched
            -   `true` will cause the block to mine at its most efficient speed, and drop items if the targeted block requires that
    -   `default_mining_speed`: float, mining speed to use if no rules match and override mining speed (default: `1.0`)
    -   `damage_per_block`: non-negative int, amount of durability to remove each time a block is mined with this tool

Oh look, it's a rare case of snapshot Thursday! This week we're expanding your arsenal with a smashing new weapon, the Mace! Use this weapon's special smash attack while leaping from a high place and watch your enemies get knocked back. The longer you fall, the harder you hit – but make sure you time it right! Your fall damage is only negated if you land the blow. Craft this new weapon by combining a Breeze Rod with the Heavy Core, a new item you can find by unlocking Trial Chamber Vaults.

As usual, we invite you to share your thoughts about this new feature over at the feedback site: [Let's talk about the Mace!](https://aka.ms/mcmacefeedback)

Alongside this hefty new mob swatter, we're also bringing you new chambers and variations to Trial Chambers, updated loot tables for Vaults, new Pottery Sherds, Armor Trims and Banner Patterns—as well as the usual slew of bug fixes and polish.

Happy mace-ing!

## Experimental Features

-   Added the Mace
-   Added Breeze Rod
-   Added Heavy Core
-   Added 2 new Armor Trims
-   Added 3 new Pottery Sherds
-   Added 2 new Banner Patterns
-   Updated Vault loot table
-   Updated Trial Chambers

## Blocks

### Heavy Core

-   A mysterious, dense block which can be combined with a Breeze Rod to craft a brand-new weapon: the Mace!

## Items

### Breeze Rod

-   An item dropped by the Breeze that can be crafted into 4 Wind Charges, or used with the Heavy Core to craft the Mace

### Mace

-   A new heavy weapon to smash your enemies!
-   Leverage the weight of this new weapon to deal additional damage the farther you fall before hitting your target
    -   Try it out by jumping down toward your target, and hit them before you hit the ground
    -   Successfully striking a target in this way will negate any damage accumulated from the fall, similar to how a Wind Charge works
    -   Other entities near the struck enemy will be knocked back by the immense force of the Mace
-   Using a Mace will decrease its durability like any other weapon; repair it with Breeze Rods at an anvil
-   Players can use a Mace in combination with Wind Charges to launch up and deliver devastating smash attacks on their enemies

## Mobs

### Breeze

-   Drops 1-2 Breeze Rods when killed by a player
    -   The number of Breeze Rods dropped is affected by looting enchantments

    -   Wind Charges
    -   Bolt Armor Trim Smithing Template
    -   Flow Armor Trim Smithing Template
    -   Flow Banner Pattern
    -   Guster Banner Pattern
    -   Heavy Core

## Changes

-   Adjusted flying behaviour for Bees and Parrot to keep them from overshooting their position when flying up and down
-   Status effect particle colors are no longer blended into one particle color
    -   All active visible status effect particles are now rendered separately
    -   The frequency of emitting status effect particles has been lowered to clutter the screen less
-   Updated the wolf armor crack textures
-   Menu background blur has been updated to look better and be more performant

### Wolf variants

When summon in other ways (e.g. using the Spawn Egg or using the `summon` command), the variant selection follows the natural spawning biome rules with the following extensions:

-   Rusty Wolf: will be selected in all Jungle biomes, including Jungle and Bamboo Jungle Biomes
-   Spotted Wolf: will be selected in all Savanna biomes, including Savanna and Windswept Savanna Biomes
-   Striped Wolf: will be selected in all Badlands biomes, including Badlands and Eroded Badlands Biomes

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 35
-   The Resource Pack version is now 29

## Data Pack Version 35

-   Removed `any` entity sub-predicate
-   Component-specific item predicate properties have been moved to separate field `predicates`
-   Added slot name `contents` for single-slot entities like item frames and item displays
-   Contents of `item` entity can now be accessed through `contents` slot name
-   Added new loot functions

### Predicates

#### Item sub-predicate

-   Some fields from item predicate have been moved to a map in an optional field `predicates`
-   The new field is similar to the `components` field on item stacks
-   This was done to simplify addition for future predicates and to allow sub-predicates to more closely resemble names of components they match
-   The following fields have been moved:
    -   `enchantments` - field moved to sub-predicate `minecraft:enchantments`
    -   `stored_enchantments` - field moved to sub-predicate `minecraft:stored_enchantments`
    -   `potions` - field moved to sub-predicate `minecraft:potion_contents`
    -   `custom_data` - field moved to sub-predicate `minecraft:custom_data`
-   `durability` field has been expanded to `minecraft:damage` predicate:
    -   This check now works for any item that has `minecraft:damage` component
    -   An item that does not have a `minecraft:damage` component can never match
    -   To check for unbreakable items, query value of `minecraft:unbreakable` component
    -   Fields:
        -   `damage` - optional bounds for value of `minecraft:damage` component
        -   `durability` - optional bounds for durability (max damage minus value of `minecraft:damage`)
-   Predicates `minecraft:enchantments`, `minecraft:stored_enchantments`, `minecraft:potion_contents` and `minecraft:damage` require matching component to exist on item
    -   That means that, for example, matching for empty enchantment list will not pass on items without `minecraft:damage` component
    -   Note: some components, like `minecraft:enchantments` have default values, so they will always match

##### Example:

Before:

    "item": {
      "enchantments": [
        {
          "enchantment": "minecraft:silk_touch",
          "levels": {
            "min": 1
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    

After:

    "item": {
      "predicates": {
        "minecraft:enchantments": [
            {
              "enchantment": "minecraft:silk_touch",
              "levels": {
                "min": 1
              }
            }
          ]
      }
    }

Woah, another snapshot day of the Wednesday variant! Today we are releasing 24w10a, featuring new Wolf Variants, some new Data Pack features, and lots of bug fixes.

Happy mining!

## New Features

-   Added variants of Wolves

### Wolf variants

-   New Wolf variants have been added
-   The variant is determined by the biome they spawn in
    -   Pale Wolf - The familiar Wolf variant that now spawns in the Taiga biome, with a default pack size of 4
    -   Woods Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Forest biome. This will be the dominant Wolf variant that you will be able to find in the Overworld, since the Forest biome is very common
    -   Ashen Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Snowy Taiga biome
    -   Black Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Old Growth Pine Taiga biome, in smaller packs of 2 to 4
    -   Chestnut Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Old Growth Spruce Taiga biome, in smaller packs of 2 to 4
    -   Rusty Wolf - A variant that spawns in a new location for wolves - the Sparse Jungle biome, in smaller packs of 2 to 4
    -   Spotted Wolf - A variant that spawns in a new location for wolves - the Savanna Plateau biome, in larger packs of 4 to 8
    -   Striped Wolf - A variant that spawns in a new location for wolves, the Wooded Badlands biome, in larger packs of 4 to 8
    -   Snowy Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Grove biome. A rare type, that always walks alone
-   Adjusted spawning conditions for Wolves, allowing them to spawn on Coarse Dirt and Podzol blocks

## Changes

-   Adjusted passive mobs spawning in Grove biome to only include Rabbits, Foxes and Wolves
-   Button tooltips will no longer appear when hovering outside the containing element

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 34

## Data Pack Version 34

-   Recipe results can now specify component data
-   Added new entity predicate field `slots`, for matching item slots
-   Added slot names for ranges, like `container.*`
-   Added `execute if|unless items` to check and count items
-   Banner Patterns are now data-driven
-   Changes to Item Stack Component formats
-   Player Head blocks now store a `custom_name` tag, which will be copied to and from the item form when broken or placed
-   The `SkullOwner` and `ExtraType` fields in Player Head blocks have been replaced with a `profile` field, with the same format as the item component
-   For now, the `count` field on Item Stacks is always stored again, even if `1`
    -   If the field is missing in data, will still fall back to `1`

### Recipes

-   Recipe types `crafting_shaped`, `crafting_shapeless`, `stonecutting` and `smithing_transform` now accept `components` for the `result` item stack
-   The `result` field for recipe types `smelting`, `blasting`, `smoking` and `campfire_cooking` is now an item stack format without a count, which means you'll need to specify an object with an `id` field
    -   This `result` now also accepts `components` data

### Predicates

#### `slots` entity sub-predicate

-   New entity field `slots` allows to check single or multiple slots on any entity
-   The field contains a map of slot names (same as ones used in `item` commands) to item predicate
-   For slot ranges, only one slot needs to match for whole entry to pass

Example:

    {
        "condition": "minecraft:entity_properties",
        "entity": "this",
        "predicate": {
            "slots": {
                "container.*": {
                    "items": "dirt"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    

### Slot names

-   Slot names (used in `item` commands and `slots` entity predicates) now include slot ranges
-   Unless specified, existing commands can still only work on single slots
-   New slot names:
    -   `container.*` - contains `container.0` to `container.53`
    -   `hotbar.*` - contains `hotbar.0` to `hotbar.8`
    -   `inventory.*` - contains `inventory.0` to `inventory.26`
    -   `enderchest.*` - contains `enderchest.0` to `enderchest.26`
    -   `villager.*` - contains `villager.0` to `villager.7`
    -   `horse.*` - contains `horse.0` to `horse.14`
    -   `weapon.*` - contains `weapon.mainhand` and `weapon.offhand`
    -   `armor.*` - contains `armor.head`, `armor.chest`, `armor.legs`, `armor.feed`, `armor.body`
    -   `player.cursor` - item held by player on screen
        -   Note: this information is not available in creative mode
    -   `player.crafting.0` - `player.crafting.3`, `player.crafting.*` - player's crafting slots
        -   Note: this includes only player's inventory crafting slots. Crafting table (or any other slots on other screens) are not included

#### `execute if|unless items`

-   `execute if|unless items <source> <slots> <item_predicate>` command can be used to count items
    -   `<source>` is the same as one used in `item` command, i.e.
        -   `block <x> <y> <z>`
        -   `entity <target>` (selector can return multiple entities)
    -   `<slots>` can accept single slot (like `container.0`) or a range (like `container.*`)
    -   `<item_predicate>` is the same as item predicate in `clear` command
-   If used alone, it will return total number of items in stacks that match predicates

### Banner Patterns

-   Banner Patterns will now be loaded into a dynamic registry from data packs (`data/<namespace>/banner_pattern/<id>`)
    -   These entries have two fields:
        -   `asset_id` (namespaced string) is used to resolve texture locations
            -   e.g. `custom:pattern` resolves to `assets/custom/textures/entity/banner/pattern.png`, `assets/custom/textures/entity/shield/pattern.png`
        -   `translation_key` (string) is a translation key prefix
            -   e.g. `block.minecraft.banner.custom.pattern` resolves to `block.minecraft.banner.custom.pattern.<dye color>`

### Item Stack Components

-   The `minecraft:profile` component no longer requires the `name` field to be present
-   Some additional Item Stack Components now support alternative, simple definitions:
    -   `minecraft:profile` can be defined as string player name (e.g. `profile="jeb_"`)
    -   `minecraft:dyed_color` can be defined as an integer rgb color (e.g. `dyed_color=16711680`)
    -   `minecraft:attribute_modifiers` can be defined as a direct list of modifiers (e.g. `attribute_modifiers=[{type:'generic.scale',uuid:[1,2,3,4],name:'Big!',amount:1.0,operation:'add_multiplied_base'}]`)
    -   `minecraft:potion_contents` can be defined as a single potion id (e.g. `potion_contents="invisibility"`)
    -   `minecraft:enchantments` and `minecraft:stored_enchantments` can be defined as an inline map of enchantment id to level (e.g. `enchantments={sharpness:1}`)
    -   These are only an alternative for defining the values, they will always be stored in their full formats
-   All container blocks now use the `minecraft:container` component when in item form, not just Shulker Boxes
-   The `minecraft:lodestone_target` component has been renamed to `minecraft:lodestone_tracker`
    -   The `pos` and `dimension` fields have been moved into a `target` object
    -   The `target` field is optional, and if not present, the compass will spin
-   The maximum number of lore and fireworks entries has been raised to 256

Hello! Here is a slightly bigger than usual snapshot with a lot of technical changes, refreshed UI, another iteration of Wolf Armor, and tweaks to new features.

Since the initial release of the Wolf Armor, we have been working on improving it to increase its protection, usability and add customization. For protection there is a new approach to armor, which considers the player's need to quickly see the state of the armor without using UI elements, and the ability to act quickly to help their pet wolf if needed. Please try it out and let us know what you think over at the feedback site: [Let's talk about Wolf Armor!](https://aka.ms/wolfarmorfeedback)

## Experimental Features

### UI

The UI has been updated to sport a fresher look and to be more consistent when it comes to the layout of different UI elements, all while retaining the essence and feel of the old screens.

As always, we're eager to hear your thoughts and opinions on further improvements or changes. Let us know what you think over at the [dedicated feedback site](https://aka.ms/JavaUIFeedback).

-   The menu background dirt texture has been replaced by a darkened background
    -   The dirt texture has been moved to the build-in Programmer Art Resource Pack
    -   Outside the game, the menu Panorama is displayed across all screen
    -   In the game, the world will be visible across all screens
    -   Paired with the darkened background is a blur
        -   The strength of the blur can be configured in Accessibility Settings
        -   In-game screens such as containers and books are not affected by these changes
-   Screen elements such as titles and buttons are positioned more consistently across different screens
-   The Player and World Backups screens in Realms have been updated
-   Lists now have clearer borders at the top and bottom
-   After defeating the Ender Dragon and entering the End Portal, the End Poem and credits are now displayed with a background based on the animated End Portal effect

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 33
-   The Resource Pack version is now 28
-   `playsound` command can now be used without specifying the player (assuming `@s`) and without specifying the mixer (assuming `master`)
-   In single player, when errors occur during loading or saving of chunks a warning will be shown in a toast
-   Trying join a single player world with less than 64 MB free disk space will show a warning screen
    -   Additionally, a warning toast will be shown periodically while in game

## Data Pack Version 33

-   Added `minecraft:bypasses_wolf_armor` for damage sources that can not be absorbed by Wolf Armor
-   Loot table entry with id `loot_table` now also accepts inline loot tables
-   Unstructured NBT data attached to stacks of items (`tag` field) has been replaced with structured 'components'

### Loot Tables

Loot table entry `loot_table` (which returns all items from provided nested loot table) now has the following syntax:

-   `value` - can be either:
    -   namespaced id - reference to another named loot table
    -   full loot table (same format as in standalone file)

### Item Stack Components

We are making some large changes to how Item Stack-specific properties are stored and represented in this snapshot, replacing the current NBT 'tag' with structured components.

This change has been made in order to:

-   Improve performance in cases where the game needs to frequently look up some property of an item (e.g. Armor Trims rendering every frame)
-   Validate item properties at load time, enabling easier identification of invalid data in commands and data packs
    -   This should avoid any 'silent' breakages in commands specifying custom item data for any potential future format changes
-   Continue to evolve the game to enable the creation of dynamic content

We understand that this is a significant breaking change for many datapacks and custom maps which will require significant effort to upgrade.

We do however believe that this builds critical foundations for future extensibility. We have taken care to ship these changes all at once, with the hope that this avoids future incremental changes requiring many small updates to packs.

The current NBT 'tag' has existed for quite some time, and we are aware that a lot of clever techniques have been developed with this for commands and data packs.

Although we have made our best effort to identify these cases, some of these techniques rely on undocumented or undefined behavior with certain tag configurations.

We want to ensure that no functionality is lost without a suitable alternative, but due to the undocumented nature of these techniques, we have very likely not caught everything!

We hope to address any regressions over the remaining course of this snapshot cycle.

With such a large change, we deeply value your feedback! You can share your thoughts on these changes over at the feedback site: [Let's talk about Item Stack Components!](https://aka.ms/ItemStackComponentsFeedback).

-   Unstructured NBT data attached to stacks of items (`tag` field) has been replaced with structured 'components'
    -   This data is parsed and validated when the item is loaded
    -   This should improve performance in certain scenarios (e.g. Armor Trim rendering) when item data was frequently compared or requested and parsed
    -   Custom data can still be stored in the `minecraft:custom_data` component
-   Item types (e.g. `minecraft:stick`) hold a set of default components on an item that individual item stacks can override
-   The format of serialized items and items in data packs has been updated for consistency and to support components
-   Item syntax in commands has been updated to support components
-   When advanced tooltips are enabled (F3+H), the number of components will be displayed instead of number of tags
-   Default component values for items are now listed in `items.json` generated in `reports` directory
-   The `ignoreTags` field on villager trades has been removed and replaced by a component predicate on damage
-   Block definitions are now added to `blocks.json` report (note: those definitions are not used yet and present only for informational purposes)
-   If the `key_item` field of Vault block is not present, the Vault cannot be unlocked

### Commands

-   Commands such as `/give`, `/item`, `/loot`, and `/clear` have updated item syntax
-   Components can now be specified after the item name in square brackets
    -   Components are assigned with an `=` (e.g. `wooden_pickaxe[damage=23]`)
    -   Components are comma-separated (e.g. `netherite_hoe[damage=5,repair_cost=2]`)
-   Component types will be autocompleted, but values themselves will not
-   Values will however be validated, and the command will fail to parse if the component is improperly specified
    -   e.g. `/give @s wooden_pickaxe[damage=-34]` is not valid
-   The pre-existing NBT syntax (`{...}`) is rewired to set or match the `minecraft:custom_data` component
    -   e.g. `/give @s stick{foo:'bar'}` is equivalent to `/give @s stick[custom_data={foo:'bar'}]`
    -   If both `[...]` and `{...}` are specified, `[...]` must be ordered before `{...}`
-   Item predicate arguments (in `/clear`) have new semantics with respect to matching components and custom data
    -   Every specified component must be present on the target item, and have an exactly equal parsed value
    -   Components with defaults (e.g. `damage=0` by default) will be assumed to exist on the target item if not specified
        -   As such, `/clear @s diamond_pickaxe[damage=0]` will match only undamaged Diamond Pickaxes
        -   On the other hand, `/clear @s diamond_pickaxe` will match any Diamond Pickaxe, irrespective of damage
    -   Exact matching of component values applies even for the `minecraft:custom_data` component
    -   However, using the `{...}` custom data syntax will use pre-existing NBT partial match behaviour
        -   This requires that all tags specified in the predicate are present on the target item, but additional ones may be ignored
        -   Lists in the target must contain all items specified in the predicate, but additional may be present and order is ignored
-   Modifier operations in the `/attribute` command have been renamed:
    -   `add` -> `add_value`
    -   `multiply_base` -> `add_multiplied_base`
    -   `multiply` -> `add_multiplied_total`

### Item Stack Format

-   Along with format changes due to components, the structures of item stacks on disk and in data packs have been updated for consistency
-   Previous `id` (string) and `Count` (byte) fields have been replaced with `id` (namespaced string) and `count` (integer) fields
    -   This format is additionally applied to the `icon` field in advancements, items in chat component hover events, and the `result` field in smelting recipes (`result` and `count` are no longer inlined)
-   The `count` field is optional (defaults to `1`), and no longer stored if default
    -   Stack size is now limited to the maximum stack size of the item
-   The `tag` field has been removed, and any remaining contents will end up in the `minecraft:custom_data` component when upgrading
-   A new `components` field stores all components attached to an item
    -   Format: map of component id to component value (varies by component id)
        -   e.g. `{..., components: {'minecraft:damage': 12}}`
        -   Components with a `!` prefix (e.g. `"!minecraft:damage": {}`) will cause this component to be removed
    -   Components equal to their default value will not be stored
-   The item stack format no longer represents empty stacks (`air` item, or `count` 0)
    -   Instead, in places that support it, the field should be ommitted
    -   In some cases, such as lists of stacks (e.g. `HandItems` in living entities), an empty map (`{}`) is used to represent empty stacks

### Other Format Changes

-   Tipped Arrows no longer store their applied potion effects
    -   This is instead fetched from their held `item`
-   Area Effect Clouds now store potions in the same format as the `minecraft:potion_contents` component in a `potion_contents` field:
    -   `Potion` -> `potion_contents.potion`
    -   `Color` -> `potion_contents.custom_color`
    -   `effects` -> `potion_contents.custom_effects`
-   Banners now store applied patterns in the same format as the `minecraft:banner_patterns` component in a `patterns` field:
    -   `Patterns[].Pattern` (string short id) -> `patterns[].pattern` (string pattern registry id)
    -   `Patterns[].Color` (integer dye id) -> `patterns[].color` (string dye name)
-   Beehive format has also been updated:
    -   `Bees[].EntityData` -> `bees[].entity_data`
    -   `Bees[].TicksInHive` -> `bees[].ticks_in_hive`
    -   `Bees[].MinOccupationTicks` -> `bees[].min_ticks_in_hive`
    -   `FlowerPos` -> `flower_pos`
-   Villager Trades can be configured to accept only undamaged items by selecting for `'minecraft:damage': 0`
    -   By default, if no components are specified, any item will be accepted (similar to `components` field in item predicates)

### Loot Item Functions

-   Added `minecraft:set_components` function
    -   Adds or replaces the given component on the input item
    -   `conditions`: list of conditions (default: `[]`):
        -   Conditions to check before applying the function
    -   `components`: map of component id to component value (format varied by id)
        -   Components with a `!` prefix (e.g. `"!minecraft:damage": {}`) will cause this component to be removed
-   Added `minecraft:copy_components` function
    -   Copies components from a specified source onto an item
    -   This is now used in the Vanilla pack in place of the `minecraft:copy_name` and `minecraft:copy_nbt` functions
    -   `conditions`: list of conditions (default: `[]`):
        -   Conditions to check before applying the function
    -   `source`: source type to pull from
        -   Currently, can only and must be `"block_entity"`
    -   `components`: list of component ids to copy
-   `minecraft:set_nbt` and `minecraft:copy_nbt` functions have been renamed to `minecraft:set_custom_data` and `minecraft:copy_custom_data` respectively
    -   These now apply to the `minecraft:custom_data` component of the target item
-   `minecraft:set_attributes` function has been updated
    -   The modifier `slot` field now supports `any`, `armor`, and `hand` values
    -   The modifier `operation` values have been renamed:
        -   `addition` -> `add_value`
        -   `multiply_base` -> `add_multiplied_base`
        -   `multiply_total` -> `add_multiplied_total`

    -   A new optional `components` field matches exact components
        -   All specified components must be present an exactly equal on the target item, but additional components may be ignored
        -   Components with defaults will be assumed to exist on the target item if not specified
        -   Format: map of component id to component value (varies by component id)
            -   e.g. `"components": { "minecraft:damage": 0 }` will match only undamaged items
-   Block predicate format has been updated:
    -   `tag` field has been removed
