# Minecraft Snapshot 24w21a

This week we're bringing a Snapshot you can vibe out to! This time around we're bringing data-driven jukeboxes, a new gamerule, and a bunch of fixes.

Happy vibing!

## Changes

-   It seems we cooked a bit too hard with the new Piston sounds last week, which is why we're reverting back to the old sounds again
-   Lowered volume of original sounds to address initial feedback of Pistons being too loud
-   Pause menu now can include a list of links provided by server
-   Improvements to the disconnection screen
-   Any member of a Realm can now upgrade a world
-   In the Realms main screen, all online players of a Realm are displayed
    -   When hovered, a tooltip is shown with each player's head and name

### Vault

-   Added sound effect to help players understand they've already looted a vault

### Trial Chambers

-   Trial Chambers are less likely to generate in the Deep Dark

### Animal Panic

-   Animals now panic based on the damage caused by predefined Damage Source Types
-   The panic lasts for 2 seconds after the damage is dealt. The following damage type tags are used by vanilla animals:
    -   `panic_environmental_causes`: Used by Wolves, Polar Bears (adults) and Pandas
    -   `panic_causes`: Used by all other animals and baby Polar Bears

### Server links

-   Servers can now provide a list of links to clients
-   If client has received any links, a new button called "Server Links..." will show up in pause game screen
    -   To make space for that button, "Report Bugs" and "Give Feedback" buttons might be moved into a sub-screen if necessary

### Disconnection screen improvements

-   In some cases client will now store detailed information about disconnection (similar to crash reports)
-   When that happens, new "Open Disconnection Report Directory" button will be added to the disconnection screen
-   When server provides link for bug reporting, it will be also be added as a button to the disconnection screen

## Technical Changes

-   Resource Pack version is now 34
-   Data Pack version is now 45
-   Server can now provide list of links to client
-   Servers can add custom details to crash and disconnection reports

### Gamerules

-   Added new `entitiesWithPassengersCanUsePortals` gamerule
    -   When `true`, entities with passengers can use Nether Portals, End Portals and End Gateways
    -   Defaults to `false`

### Server links

-   New clientbound packet `server_links` is available in `configuration` and `game` protocols
-   On receival, client will make links available from pause menu
-   Link labels can be built-in or custom (i.e. any text)
-   Some built-ins also have special fuctionality:
    -   `report_bug`:
        -   link will be displayed on disconnection screen, if disconnection was caused by packet handling error
        -   link will be included as a comment in disconnection report
-   Added `bug-report-link` to `server.properties` to allow vanilla server to configure `report_bug` links
    -   If this field is non-empty, server will send that link to clients
    -   This field should contain well-formed URL

### Custom server crash report details

-   New clientbound packet `custom_report_details` is available in `configuration` and `game` protocols
-   This packet contains a list of key-value text entries
-   If received, contents of this packet will be added in a separate section to any crash or disconnection report generated during connection to this server

## Data Pack Version 45

-   Jukebox songs are now data-driven
-   Added new command syntax

### Jukebox Songs

-   Added a jukebox song registry which is loaded from data packs
-   Path to jukebox song definition is `data/<namespace>/jukebox_song/<id>.json`
-   Fields in definition:
    -   `sound_event` - sound event that is streamed when played by a Jukebox
    -   `description` - the name of the song that will be displayed in the hover tooltip represented as a Text Component
    -   `length_in_seconds` - length of the song in seconds as a positive float
    -   `comparator_output` - the redstone signal output by a comparator when played in a Jukebox, between 0 and 15
-   Added `minecraft:jukebox_playable` item stack component

#### `jukebox_playable` item component

-   If set, the item can be inserted into Jukeboxes to play a song
-   Format: object with fields
    -   `song`: jukebox song id
        -   The song that will be played by the Jukebox when this item stack is inserted
    -   `show_in_tooltip`: boolean (default: true)
        -   If false, the name of the song will not be shown in the tooltip
        -   This was formerly controlled by the `hide_additional_tooltip` component on Music Discs
    -   e.g. `jukebox_playable={song:'minecraft:precipice'}`, `jukebox_playable={song:'minecraft:precipice', show_in_tooltip:false}`

### Attributes

-   Attribute modifiers no longer have a UUID and name combination
-   Instead, attribute modifiers are now uniquely identified by a namespaced ID, similar to other resources
-   The ID of a modifier uniquely identifies it in the set of modifiers for a single attribute
    -   Using the same ID for different modifiers is allowed as long as the modifiers are for different attributes
-   Existing built-in modifiers will be upgraded to new IDs
-   Existing custom modifiers will be upgraded to the GUID as an ID in the `minecraft` namespace

#### `attribute` command

-   The `uuid` and `name` arguments have been replaced with a singular `id` argument

#### Item Stack Attribute Modifiers

-   The `uuid` and `name` fields have been removed.
-   Attribute Modifiers now have an `id` (namespaced ID) field
    -   This is a unique identifier per attribute for the modifier

#### Entity Attributes

-   Attributes are now stored as `attributes`
-   Attribute format:
    -   `id`, renamed from `Name`
    -   `base`, renamed from `Base`
    -   `modifiers`, renamed from `Modifiers`
        -   Now stores modifiers in the same format as modifiers in `attribute_modifiers` item stack components:
            -   `id`, replaces `UUID` and `Name`
            -   `amount`, renamed from `Amount`
            -   `operation`, renamed from `Operation`, now a named constant instead of an int:
                -   `add_value` - previously `0`
                -   `add_multiplied_base` - previously `1`
                -   `add_multiplied_total` - previously `2`

### Enchantments

#### Attribute Effects

Fields:

-   `name` & `uuid` have been removed, replaced by `id`
-   `id`: The namespaced ID of the Attribute Modifier to add
    -   This will be postfixed with the slot name when the enchanted item is equipped in a slot
    -   Must be unique to avoid different Enchantments (or other systems) interfering with each others

#### Entity Effect Types

##### `damage_item`

The damage is not applied to items held by players in creative mode.

##### Hit Block Parameters

-   Entities: `this`
-   Enchantment Level
-   Origin
-   Block State

#### Effect Components

-   `minecraft:hit_block`:
    -   Condition Context: changed to take a Hit Block Parameter - `this` is the entity hitting the Block

### Tags

#### Directory renames

-   Some registry types that used legacy datapack directory names (based on plural name of element) have been renamed to match registry name
-   Affected directories:
    -   `structures` -> `structure`
    -   `advancements` -> `advancement`
    -   `recipes` -> `recipe`
    -   `loot_tables` -> `loot_table`
    -   `predicates` -> `predicate`
    -   `item_modifiers` -> `item_modifier`
    -   `functions` -> `function`
    -   `tags/functions` -> `tags/function`

#### Item Tags

-   Removed `music_discs` item tag

#### Block Tags

-   `air`: All blocks that resemble air

#### Damage Type Tags

-   Removed `breeze_immune_to` damage type tag
-   Added `panic_environmental_causes`: Damage types that cause panic in aggressive animals that can panic, i.e. mobs that retaliate when attacked
-   Added `panic_causes`: Damage types that cause panic in passive animals, i.e. mobs that run away when attacked

### Predicates

#### Jukebox Playable Predicate

New item sub-predicate available as `jukebox_playable`.

-   Matcher for `jukebox_playable` component (like Music Discs)
-   Fields:
    -   `song` - optional id, list of ids or tag for jukebox song to be matched

#### Player Predicate

-   The `gamemode` field has been changed to accept a list of gamemodes

### Commands

-   Added `@n` entity selector, selecting the nearest entity
    -   This functions as `@e[sort=nearest,limit=1]`
    -   Additional requirements may still be provided; for example: `@n[type=pig]` will select the closest Pig

## Resource Pack Version 34

-   Added the `block.vault.reject_rewarded_player` sound event
-   Changes to Shaders

### Shaders

-   The `blend` block in core shader definitions has been removed, as it was not used

-   The `glint_direct` shader has been removed, replaced with the pre-existing `glint` shader
-   The `armor_glint` shader has been removed, as it was unused

After some recent irregularities in our Snapshot schedule (public holidays, we're looking at you!) we're back to shipping on a Wednesday! Among other things, 24w20a includes a buff to the amount of Redstone Dust dropped by Witches, as well as a long requested change to make Piston sounds a tad more pleasing to the ear. We're also throwing 41 new bug fixes into the mix, because we like squashing bugs.

Happy mining!

## Changes

-   Witches now always drop 4-8 redstone dust on death
    -   This is to improve the viability of farms that utilize Witch Huts to obtain Redstone Dust
-   Improved player attribute and effect handling
    -   Custom set base attributes are now kept when respawning
    -   Active effects and modifiers are kept when changing dimension or winning the game
-   Updated credits

### Sounds

-   Updated Piston sounds to lower volume and attenuation
    -   This was done to address the long-received feedback on the old sounds being too harsh and loud, creating very noisy redstone builds

## Technical Changes

-   Data Pack version is now 44

## Data Pack Version 44

-   `dimension_padding` jigsaw structure NBT tag was changed
    -   Now it is an object with fields:
        -   `bottom` the vertical padding at the bottom of the dimension, non-negative integer
        -   `top` the vertical padding at the top of the dimension, non-negative integer
    -   Can be written as a single non-negative integer instead to be applied to both top and bottom fields
        -   e.g. both `dimension_padding: 10` or `dimension_padding: { bottom: 10, top: 5 }` are valid
-   Data-driven enchantment field `weight` now has an upper bound of 1024
-   Data-driven enchantment field `max_level` now has an upper bound of 255

### Predicates

#### Entity Predicate

-   New option: `movement_affected_by` - optional Location Predicate
    -   When present, adds requirements on a block at most 0.5 blocks below the entity which can affect its movement

---

The weekend is right around the corner, and what better way to celebrate that fact than by bringing you a serving of Snapshot Friday? This one rounds off the week by introducing performance improvements to chunk loading, alongside the usual assortment of technical improvements and bug fixes.

On another note, last week's Snapshot introduced some changes to the Mace that went undocumented in the 24w18a changelog. That was a whoopsie on our end, and to clear up any confusion we've decided to add those changes to this changelog in addition to updating the previous one. We're sorry about that!

Happy mining!

## Mace changes from 24w18a

-   Raised Mace durability from 250 to 500
-   Reduced Mace base damage to 5
-   Lower the Mace attack speed from -2.4 to -3.5
-   Reduced Density damage per level per block to 0.5
-   Mace Smash attack damage now has a fall off:
    -   First 3 blocks fallen give 4 damage per block
    -   Next 5 blocks fallen give 2 damage per block
    -   Any block fallen after that give 1 damage per block
-   Density and Breach are now incompatible with each other and the other damage enchantments (Smite and Bane of Arthropods)

## Changes

-   Blocks frozen by Frost Walker now emit "Block Placed" vibrations (frequency 13)
-   Changes to sounds
-   Improved chunk loading performance

### Sounds

-   Added 4 new cave ambient sounds
-   Replaced turn off and turn on sounds for Copper Bulb with one toggle sound

### Chunk loading improvements

-   When reading an already generated chunk from disk, surrounding chunks are no longer unnecessarily loaded
    -   This is also visible on the singleplayer world loading screen
-   The new system has less memory and CPU overhead

## Technical Changes

-   Data Pack version is now 43

## Data Pack Version 43

-   The `custom_data` component can now be specified as an SNBT string to preserve type information in JSON
    -   This is the same as is used in the `set_custom_data` loot function and `custom_data` predicate
-   The `food` item component has new fields:
    -   `using_converts_to`: item with components (optional)
        -   Once consumed, the food item will be replaced with the specified item
        -   e.g. `food={nutrition:1,saturation:0,using_converts_to:{id:"poisonous_potato",components:{"minecraft:custom_name":'"Wait what?"'}}}`
-   Registry `decorated_pot_patterns` has been renamed to `decorated_pot_pattern`
-   Removed legacy tag directory names
-   Removed `power` NBT tag and replaced with `acceleration_power` tag with a number value that contol the projectiles acceleration (and maximum speed)
    -   This change affects the following projectiles; `dragon_fireball`, `large_fireball`, `small_fireball`, `fireball`, `breeze_wind_charge`, `wind_charge`, `wither_skull`
-   New NBT tag `dimension_padding` for structures
    -   ensures that a structure is not generating through the edges of a dimension by adding vertical padding to its bounding box
    -   default is 0
    -   Trial Chambers have a padding of 10 since they are generated deep underground and sometimes would intersect with Bedrock layer

### Enchantments

#### Entity Effect Types

-   Added field `trigger_game_event` for effect types `replace_block`, `replace_disc` and `set_block_properties`
    -   Format: Optional Game Event ID for a game event to trigger when a block has been replaced

### Tags
