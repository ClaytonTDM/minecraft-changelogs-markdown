### Advancements

**New triggers**

**`started_riding`**

-   Triggered when player starts riding a vehicle or entity starts riding vehicle currently ridden by player
-   Conditions:
    -   `player` - either a player that started riding or one of boat passengers

**`lightning_strike`**

-   Triggered when lighting finishes (i.e. entity disappears)
-   Triggers for any player on server
-   Conditions
    -   `player` - player for which this trigger runs
    -   `lightning` - predicate for lightning entity
    -   `bystander` - predicate for one of the entities in certain area around strike not hurt by it

**`using_item`**

-   Triggered for every tick of using items (like crossbows, spyglass, fishing rods, etc)
-   Conditions
    -   `player` - players that uses item
    -   `item` - item being used

**Changed triggers**

**`effects_changed`**

-   Added `source` triggers that matches entity that triggered the change
-   Might be empty when:
    -   there is no entity (for example, effect gained from beacon)

    -   effect is removed

-   `lightning_bolt` - sub-predicate valid only for lightning bolt entity

**Player predicate**

-   `looking_at` - entity currently viewed by player
    -   uses same line-of-sight rules as attacking mobs
    -   actual detection radius might be changed in future

**Lightning bolt**

-   `blocks_set_on_fire` - range check for of blocks set on fire by this entity

### Performance metrics reporting

These will be saved to a zip file in `debug/profiling/<yyyy-MM-dd_HH.mm.ss-[levelname]-[version]>.zip` and could be used for performance regression analysis if included in bug reports.

The exact metrics, output format, and names are susceptible to change between versions. Our plan is to continue iterating on which metrics to capture.

**Client F3+L shortcut**

Pressing F3+L while in the game will start a recording for 10 seconds capturing metrics such as tick durations, used heap sizes and other more detailed stats.

Pressing F3+L before the 10-second limit will end the recording early.

This shortcut is always available to clients, even on multi-player servers where it will record client-side performance.

**Dedicated Server perf start/stop command**

`perf start` will start a recording for 10 seconds capturing metrics such as tick durations, used heap sizes and other more detailed stats.

`perf stop` before the 10-second limit will end the recording early.

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w19a

Now with twice as much Java version.

Starting with this snapshot, Candles, Bundles, and Sculk Sensors are only accessible through commands. We do not feel that they are at the quality we want for Part 1 of the Caves & Cliffs release. To keep trying these features out in survival mode, use the Preview data pack!

## Changes in 21w19a

-   The maximum length of item names in the anvil UI has been increased from 35 to 50
-   Made geodes significantly rarer
-   Unfinished items (Sculk Sensor, Bundle and Candles) have been removed from the creative inventory
-   Recipes for unfinished items (Bundle, Candles) have been removed

## Changes to the Caves & Cliffs Preview

Download the [updated datapack](https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/a6b56d6f14869646eb8d399e99a0149bdd954490/CavesAndCliffsPreview.zip).

-   The pack now includes recipes related to bundles and candles

## Technical changes in 21w19a

-   Upgraded to Java 16
-   Added `mineable/axe`, `mineable/hoe`, `mineable/pickaxe` and `mineable/shovel` block tags. Blocks with these tags can be destroyed more quickly with the matching tool.
-   Added `needs_stone_tool`, `needs_iron_tool` and `needs_diamond_tool` block tags. If a block requires the correct tool to drop, these tags determine which tier of that tool is required.
-   Changed the syntax of the `/item` command

### Java 16

Minecraft now uses a more recent version of Java. If you are using a default setup the Launcher will download and install the correct version. If you are using a custom Java setup or a third-party launcher, you will need to ensure that your Java installation is version 16 or above.

### Item command

New syntax:

-   `/item replace <target> with <item stack> [<count>]` - same as old `replaceitem`
-   `/item replace <target> from <source> [<modifier>]` - copies item for source to target(s), optionally applying modifier
-   `/item modify <target> <modifier>` - modifies item (without copying)

For example, `/item replace block ~ ~ ~ container.0 from entity @s enderchest.0` will copy first item from player's enderchest to first slot of container player is currently standing on.
