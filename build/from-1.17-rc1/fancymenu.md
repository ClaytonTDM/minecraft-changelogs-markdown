## Technical changes in 1.17 Pre-release 1

-   Added `started_riding`, `lightning_strike` and `using_item` advancement triggers
-   Added `source` condition to `effects_changed` trigger
-   Added `lightning_bolt` sub-predicate
-   Added `passenger`, `stepping_on` and `lightning_bolt` properties to entity predicate

-   perf start/stop command on dedicated servers will now generate and persist server performance metrics

### Advancements

#### New triggers

##### `started_riding`

-   Triggered when player starts riding a vehicle or entity starts riding vehicle currently ridden by player
-   Conditions:
    -   `player` - either a player that started riding or one of boat passengers

##### `lightning_strike`

-   Triggered when lighting finishes (i.e. entity disappears)
-   Triggers for any player on server
-   Conditions
    -   `player` - player for which this trigger runs
    -   `lightning` - predicate for lightning entity
    -   `bystander` - predicate for one of the entities in certain area around strike not hurt by it

##### `using_item`

-   Triggered for every tick of using items (like crossbows, spyglass, fishing rods, etc)
-   Conditions
    -   `player` - players that uses item
    -   `item` - item being used

#### Changed triggers

##### `effects_changed`

-   Added `source` triggers that matches entity that triggered the change
-   Might be empty when:
    -   there is no entity (for example, effect gained from beacon)
    -   the effect is self-applied
    -   effect is removed

#### Changed predicates

##### Item predicate

-   `item` field expended to `items`, now accepting array of item types

##### Block predicate

-   `block` field expended to `blocks`, now accepting array of block types

##### Entity predicate

-   `stepping_on` - location predicate for block entity is currently standing on
-   `lightning_bolt` - sub-predicate valid only for lightning bolt entity

##### Player predicate

-   `looking_at` - entity currently viewed by player
    -   uses same line-of-sight rules as attacking mobs
    -   actual detection radius might be changed in future

#### Lightning bolt

-   `blocks_set_on_fire` - range check for of blocks set on fire by this entity
-   `entity_struck` - predicate for entities struck by this lightning (if present, must match one or more)

### Performance metrics reporting

These will be saved to a zip file in `debug/profiling/<yyyy-MM-dd_HH.mm.ss-[levelname]-[version]>.zip` and could be used for performance regression analysis if included in bug reports.

The exact metrics, output format, and names are susceptible to change between versions. Our plan is to continue iterating on which metrics to capture.

#### Client F3+L shortcut

Pressing F3+L while in the game will start a recording for 10 seconds capturing metrics such as tick durations, used heap sizes and other more detailed stats.

Pressing F3+L before the 10-second limit will end the recording early.

This shortcut is always available to clients, even on multi-player servers where it will record client-side performance.

#### Dedicated Server perf start/stop command

`perf start` will start a recording for 10 seconds capturing metrics such as tick durations, used heap sizes and other more detailed stats.

`perf stop` before the 10-second limit will end the recording early.

Time for another pre-release! This time around we've fixed some issues with the new social interactions screen and we've also fixed some crashes.

In case you haven't heard, yesterday we announced that Mojang accounts will be migrating into Microsoft accounts. With this pre-release, we are preparing for that by having the game understand the settings and block-list of Microsoft accounts. You can read more about that over [here](https://www.minecraft.net/article/java-edition-moving-house), and you can find answers to questions you might have in the [FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/articles/360050865492). The FAQ will be continuously updated.

We aim to release 1.16.4 sometime during next week.

## Changes in 1.16.4 Pre-release 2

-   Players blocked in your Microsoft account are now also blocked in the game
-   A button to open a link to the Accessibility Guide can now be found in the Accessibility Options screen

### Social Interactions

-   The status of a player is now listed below their name on the Social Interactions screen
-   A new tab is available to filter by Blocked players in the Social Interactions screen
-   Chat from blocked players is always hidden
-   Realms invites from blocked players are hidden

# Minecraft 1.16.4 Pre-Release 1

The first pre-release for 1.16.4 is officially out! ​ If you’ve been on the Internet for some time, you’ve probably noticed that you occasionally run into other players that you don’t get along with. To alleviate some of that frustration, we’re introducing a UI element called the “social interactions screen”, which will let you disable chatting with certain players, thus hiding any messages you receive from them. Additionally, the 1.16.4 update will contain some fixes for critical bugs, but other than that, this will be it for this dot-release. ​ Please help us out by testing the new UI and reporting any bugs you find on the [Minecraft Issue Tracker](https://aka.ms/snapshotbugs?ref=launcher). ​

## New Features in 1.16.4 Pre-release 1

​

-   New UI called Social Interactions Screen

​

### Social Interactions Screen

A new screen available in Multiplayer which shows a list of all players on a server so you can can hide chat from any player. ​

-   Opens with a configurable key binding, by default P
-   Whether a player is hidden resets when re-joining a server

​

## Technical Changes in 1.16.4 Pre-release 1

​

-   New network protocol scheme, with a high bit (bit 30) set for snapshots. The protocol version will increase by 1 for each snapshot, but full releases may keep the same protocol version as the previous full release in cases where the network protocols are compatible
-   More information is now added to the crash log in cases where poor performance causes the server to crash

# Minecraft 1.16 Release Candidate

Out with the old, and in with the new! Today we're introducing a new naming convention (well, it's been a while) for Minecraft Java Edition. Previously, the last pre-release was, in fact, the release candidate, but we're now making that more clear by changing the name to be "release candidate". This means that if there are no major issues following this release, no further changes will be done before the full release.

Speaking of the full release: In case you've been living under a rock (it's Minecraft, so that's OK), [we're releasing the Nether Update on Tuesday, June 23](https://www.minecraft.net/article/the-nether-update-has-date-). That's next week!

## Fixed Bugs in 1.16 Release Candidate 1

-   Fixed issues with the Nether surface generation, causing issues like floating lava and crimson forests without nylium
-   [MC-150543](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-150543) Using a stonecutter can sometimes crash the game in certain circumstances
-   [MC-174790](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-174790) Mob on turtle eggs causes the game to crash
