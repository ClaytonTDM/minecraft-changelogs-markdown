# Minecraft Snapshot 21w39a

Time for an Advanced snapshot! In this snapshot, you can also open worlds from previous versions again - with one big warning! The blending technology we intend to introduce for Caves & Cliffs: Part II is not yet available. If you open an old world in this snapshot it will be upgraded with air under the current bottom of the world and visible chunk borders to new areas.

**We highly recommend backing up your world before loading it in this snapshot.**

## New Features in 21w39a

-   Added Caves & Cliffs: Part II Advancements

### Advancements

-   Added "Caves & Cliffs" for falling from top to bottom of the Overworld
-   Added "Feels like home" for riding strider on lava for 50 blocks in the Overworld
-   Added "Star Trader" for trading with a villager at the build height limit
-   Added "Sound of Music" for playing music with a jukebox in a Meadow biome

## Changes in 21w39a

-   Tweaked peaks to make small mountains look more like proper jagged mountain peaks instead of flat hilly mounds
-   The lone trees in Meadows now always contain a bee nest
-   Drowned can spawn in aquifers inside dripstone caves
-   Zombies don't spawn in dripstone caves
-   Buried treasure chests can now contain water breathing potions
-   Changed default brightness to 50
-   Redesigned how effects look in the inventory screen, to allow them to show even with recipe book open

### Effects

-   Your list of effects are now shown to the right of your inventory, instead of the left side
-   When the inventory effects list is visible, it will be hidden from the game view to reduce screen clutter
-   There's now two modes of seeing the effect list: compact and classic
    -   Classic is the pre-existing list of effects, one after another
    -   Compact is a single icon for each effect, suitable for small screen estate
-   The game will automatically switch between the two looks to suit the available screen estate (including having the recipe book open)

## Technical Changes in 21w39a

-   Added `fall_from_height` and `ride_entity_distance` advancement triggers
-   Changed `nether_travel` to match other similar triggers
-   Added new loot table function `set_potion`
-   Changes to the on-disk chunk format
-   Resource pack format has been increased to 8
-   Standalone `server.jar` now bundles contains individual libraries instead of being flat archive

### Advancements

#### New triggers

##### `fall_from_height`

-   Triggered when a player lands after falling
-   Conditions:
    -   `player` - a player for which this trigger runs
    -   `start_position` - location predicate for last position before falling started
    -   `distance` - predicate for distance between `start_position` and player

##### `ride_entity_in_lava`

-   Triggered for every tick when player rides in lava
-   Conditions
    -   `player` - a player for which this trigger runs
    -   `start_position` - position where riding started (first tick on lava)
    -   `distance` - predicate for distance between `start_position` and player

#### Changed triggers

##### `nether_travel`

-   `entered` condition renamed to `start_position`
-   `exited` has been removed, since it was identical to `player.location`

### Loot Tables

#### New functions

##### `set_potion`

Sets `Potion` tag on any item

###### Parameters:

-   `id` - potion id

### World Data: Chunk Format

-   Chunk's `Level.Sections[].BlockStates` & `Level.Sections[].Palette` have moved to a container structure in `Level.Sections[].block_states`
-   Chunk's `Level.Biomes` are now paletted and live in a similar container structure in `Level.Sections[].biomes`
-   Chunk's `Level.CarvingMasks[]` is now `long[]` instead of `byte[]`

### Resource Pack format

-   `minecraft/textures/gui/container/inventory.png` now contains an extra sprite for a thin-layout version of the effect list in the inventory

### Server bundling

-   `server.jar` now bundles individual libraries instead of merging all the files into single archive
-   This change is meant to solve certain problems related to Java modules
-   On startup, `server.jar` will unpack libraries into directory configured by `bundlerRepoDir` (default: working directory)
-   To run different main class than server, use `bundlerMainClass` property (for example `java -DbundlerMainClass=net.minecraft.data.Main -jar server.jar --reports`) or unpack jar manually and use contents of `META-INF/classpath-joined` for command line

The second Caves & Cliffs: Part II snapshot is here! This snapshot mostly contains tweaks and bug fixes, but there are also some new technical additions such as a separate simulation distance slider and an increased thread count (no I'm not talking about the fancy sheets you're thinking about buying).

Oh, and you also seemed to enjoy Strongholds quite a lot, so we decided to add them back into the game. Enjoy!

## Known Issues in 21w38a

-   This snapshot is still not compatible with older worlds - to play in this snapshot, you will have to create a new world
-   World saving can sometimes take a very long time - if you see the world stop moving for a time, this is why

## Changes in 21w38a

-   Sprinting is no longer reduced to walking when gently brushing your sleeve against a wall
-   Fixes for the distribution of ores

### Ore distribution

-   Copper ore generates up to y 95 (as originally designed)
-   Increased the amount of copper
-   Lapis lazuli generates in blobs, like other ores (instead of spread out)

### Sprinting

-   Previously, any collision with a block would reduce sprinting to walking. Now, for very minor angles of collision with a block, players retain their sprint. For larger angles of collision, the old behavior is retained.

## Technical Changes in 21w38a

-   A new setting has been added: "Simulation distance"
-   Maximum amount of background threads increased
-   Added telemetry for world loading

### Simulation distance setting

-   Entities will not be updated outside of simulation distance.
-   Allows higher render distance with less CPU load.
-   A new slider in video settings on the client.
-   A new `simulation-distance` property in dedicated server properties.
-   We will continue working on it with a goal of simulation distance also affecting block and fluid ticking.

### Maximum amount of background threads increased

Various background tasks including worldgen are executed on a background thread pool. Its size equals the amount of available CPU threads minus one, but there was an upper limit of 7. Now this upper limit is 255. This should help higher-end machines with world-gen performance.

The upper limit can be overridden by `max.bg.threads` Java system property, for example when running multiple servers on a single machine.

### Telemetry

In this release, we are re-introducing diagnostic tracking, which was part of Minecraft: Java Edition until 2018. We are bringing it back to better understand our players and to improve their experience. Specifically, we hope to ensure stronger performance for the extremely heavy world generation in the second part of the Caves & Cliffs update later this year.

In practice, this can mean identifying technical pain points in the game, like how less powerful hardware performs in high-complexity terrain. This information will also help us prioritize various aspects of development, balance game features (by learning, for instance, that the goats are pushing every single player off the cliffs) and lend new Minecrafters a helping hand (after realizing that many of them get stuck at the same points). All data is treated according to GDPR and CCPA best practices and is used to develop a better-performing and generally more enjoyable Minecraft: Java Edition.

At this point the only implemented event is world load.

#### World Load event

-   Sent when loading singleplayer world or connecting to multiplayer server
-   Contains following information:
    -   launcher identifier
    -   user identitifer (XUID)
    -   client session id (changes on restart)
    -   world session id (changes per world load, to be reused for later events)
    -   game version
    -   operating system name and version
    -   Java runtime version
    -   if client or server is modded (same information as on crash logs)
    -   server type (single player, Realms or other)
    -   game mode

## Bugs fixed in 21w38a

Marvellous mountains and colossal caves, this snapshot has it all! Today we're bringing the Overworld revamp to regular snapshots. If you've been playing or checking out the experimental snapshots that we've been releasing, you should be familiar with what you're seeing. If not, you're in for a treat!

Since we're extending the world height, and there are quite a few under-the-hood changes, we've been keeping an eye on how the game is running, and there are still improvements to be made. However, we would still appreciate it if you would be able to take this survey so that we can understand how you perceive the performance of this snapshot.

It should also be noted that there is currently no upgrade path for existing worlds in this snapshot. This means that you can only create new worlds in this snapshot, and not play on any of your existing worlds. We're working on this and you should be able to play on your existing worlds in an upcoming snapshot not too far in the future.

All of this said, we hope that you have a great time checking out these new additions. Watch your feet so that you don't fall into a very deep hole, and make sure you don't get punted off a mountain by a goat that's just minding its own business.

Happy mining!

## New Features in 21w37a

-   Added noise caves and aquifers
-   Added Dripstone Caves underground biome
-   Added Grove biome
-   Added Lofty peaks biome
-   Added Lush Caves underground biome
-   Added Meadow biome
-   Added Snowcapped peaks biome
-   Added Snowy slopes biome
-   Added Stony peaks biome
-   New ore distribution and large ore veins
-   Overworld build and generation limits have been expanded

### Blocks

-   Enchanting Tables now emit a low amount of light
-   Using shears on the tip of a Cave Vine, Twisting Vine, Weeping Wine or Kelp now causes it to stop growing

### Dripstone Caves biome

-   Contains plenty of Pointed Dripstone and Dripstone Block on the floors and ceilings, and small pools of water
-   In some places you'll find larger stalagmites, stalactites, and columns built from Dripstone Blocks
-   Contains extra copper ore

### Grove

-   Snowy terrain with big spruce trees and powder snow traps. Might want to wear leather boots!
-   Tends to generate on high-altitude terrain beneath mountain peaks or on hilltops.
-   Spawns wolfs, rabbits, and foxes.

### Large ore veins

-   Ore veins are large, rare, snake-like underground ore formations
-   Copper veins form between y 0 and y 50 and are mixed with Granite
-   Iron veins form below y -60 and y -8 and are mixed with Tuff

### Lofty peaks

-   Dramatic jagged mountain peaks with snow and stone
-   Spawns goats

### Lush Caves biome

-   Moss covers the floors and ceilings
-   Spore Blossoms grow from the ceiling and drip particles
-   Contains Clay pools with Dripleaf plants growing out of them
-   Contains Azalea Bushes and Flowering Azalea Bushes
-   The Azalea Tree loves to have its roots in Lush Caves, so if you find an Azalea Tree (either overground or in a cave) you know there is a Lush Cave beneath you
-   Cave Vines with Glow Berries grow from the ceiling and light up the caves

### Meadow biome

-   Large grassy and flowery biome that tends to generate high up on plateaus or next to large mountain ranges.
-   Sometimes contains a lone tall oak or birch tree, often with a bee nest.
-   Think Sound of Music!
-   Spawns donkeys, rabbits, and sheep.

### Mob Spawning

-   Monsters now only spawn in places where the light from blocks is 0 (sky light still prevents spawning like before)
-   Fixed an issue where players in multiplayer can face more or far fewer enemies than intended, particularly when other players are flying

### New ore distribution

-   Changed ore generation to match the new world height, and to add more strategy to mining.
-   There is no longer a single y level that is best for all ores, you need to make tradeoffs.
-   Iron ore generates below y 72, with a strong bias towards y 16.
-   Iron ore also generates above 112, with more iron ore as you go higher.
-   Copper ore generates between y 0 and y 96, with a strong bias towards y 48.
-   Copper ore generates in larger amounts in dripstone caves biome.
-   Lapis lazuli generates below y 64, with a strong bias towards y 0. However, Lapis below y -32 or above y 32 cannot generate exposed to air. It will either be buried or inside water.
-   Coal generates above y 0, with a strong bias towards y 96 and above.
-   Coal has reduced air exposure, so you will find more coal buried or underwater than exposed to air.
-   Gold generates below y 32, with a strong bias towards y -16.
-   Extra gold can (still) be found in badlands biomes.
-   Redstone ore generates below y 16. Redstone ore generation gradually increases as you go below y -32 and further down.
-   Diamond generates below y 16, with more diamond the lower you go.
-   Diamonds have reduced air exposure, so you will find more diamond buried or underwater than exposed to air.

### Noise caves and Aquifers

-   Noise caves are a new way of generating caves, providing more natural variety. They can get really huge sometimes! Noise caves come in three flavors:
    -   Cheese caves. Like the holes in swiss cheese. These often form caverns of various size
    -   Spaghetti caves. Long squiggly tunnels, sometimes wide like tagliatelle
    -   Noodle caves. Thinner, squigglier, and more claustrophobic variant of spaghetti caves
-   No, they aren't loud. The "noise" part of noise caves is a technical term and has nothing to do with sound
-   The old cave carvers and canyons still generate, combining with the noise caves to form interesting cave systems
-   As with carvers, when noise caves intersect the surface they form cave entrances
-   An aquifer is an area with local water level, independent of sea level. Aquifers are used during world generation to generate bodies of water inside noise caves. This sometimes results in large underground lakes! They can also form inside mountains and on the surface.
-   Aquifers below y0 will sometimes be lava aquifers instead of water aquifers
-   Magma Blocks sometimes generates at the bottom of underground bodies of water
-   Underwater cave carvers and underwater canyons have been removed, since aquifers are used to generate water in caves instead

### Options

-   Added an accessibility option to stop the sky flashing during thunderstorms
-   Added an option to specify the audio device used by the game
-   Added "Toggle Sprint" and "Toggle Sneak" to the Controls settings
-   Moved Keybinds out to their own settings screen, accessible from Controls

### Snowcapped peaks

-   Smooth mountain peaks with ice and snow
-   Spawns goats and yeti. No actually just goats.

### Snowy slopes

-   Very snowy terrain that can hide powder snow traps. Might want to wear leather boots!
-   Tends to generate on high-altitude terrain beneath mountain peaks or on hilltops.
-   Spawns rabbits and goats.

### Stony peaks

-   Stony mountain peaks that may be jagged or smooth
-   Spawns goats
-   Contains strips of calcite sometimes

### World generation

-   Generation range and build limits have been expanded by 64 blocks up and 64 blocks down, to a total range of 384 blocks
-   Underground features, structures, and caves generate all the way down to y-64
-   Exception: Diorite and Granite and Andesite and Dirt don't generate below y0
-   Tweaked size and positioning of Diorite, Andesite & Granite generation
-   Dripstone clusters can no longer be found in normal caves, only in dripstone caves biome
-   Starting from y0 and below deepslate gradually replaces all stone
-   Deepslate blobs no longer generate above y0
-   The terrain shape and elevation varies dramatically, indepedently from biomes. For example, forests and deserts could form up on a hill without needing a special biome just for that
-   Less diorite/granite/andesite generates above y 60
-   Strips of gravel can generate in stony shores
-   Swamp trees can grow in water 2 blocks deep (instead of just 1 block deep)

## Changes in 21w37a

-   Illagers (Vindicator, Pillager, Evoker) no longer attack baby villagers
-   Axolotls now only spawn in lush caves
-   Axolotls now have their own, separate, mob cap
-   Raised the cloud level from 128 to 192

## Technical Changes in 21w37a

-   Replaced the clientbound chunk update network packet with another one which additionally contains light update data. Separate light update packet still exists and is sent when light update happens without chunk update.
-   View distance now causes chunks to load cylindrically around players instead of in a square
-   Information about the world generation noise is now displayed on the debug screen
-   Added `illageralt`, rune-like font from Minecraft Dungeons (currently only usable via commands)
-   Added startup option `--jfrProfile` and command `jfr` to start profiling with Java FlightRecorder as well as a few custom events.
-   Loot table functions `set_contents` and `set_loot_table` now require `type` field with valid block entity type
-   Worlds last saved before Minecraft 1.2 ("pre-anvil") no longer can be opened directly
-   Data pack format has been increased to 8
-   New video setting "Priority updates".
-   Removed length limits for scoreboard, score holder and team names
-   Mob spawners can now override light checks for spawning

### JFR Profiling

#### Custom events

-   `minecraft.ServerTickTime`: sampling event exposing average server tick times at one second intervals
-   `minecraft.ChunkGeneration`: time taken to generate individual chunk stages
-   `minecraft.PacketRead | minecraft.PacketSent`: network traffic
-   `minecraft.WorldLoadFinishedEvent`: initial world loading duration

#### Ending a profiling run

The run will then be stopped either by:

-   shutting down the JVM
-   `jfr stop` in-game command
-   `jcmd` CLI tool

#### Overview

Java Flight Recorder ([https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/328](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/328)) is the internal JVM profiling tool bundled with the Java Runtime to analyze performance and runtime characteristics. It's a useful tool for exposing internal JVM performance metrics as well as custom metrics that can be monitored or analyzed using any stock Java profiler or monitoring agents.

#### Reports

A summary JSON report is written both to the log file and in the debug folder accompanied by a `.jfr` recording ready to be analyzed in i.e JMC [https://github.com/openjdk/jmc](https://github.com/openjdk/jmc) or any other profiler tool supporting the format.

#### Starting a profiling run

A profiling run can be started using any of the following alternatives:

-   `--jfrProfile` startup flag when starting a Minecraft server or client
-   `jfr start` in-game command
-   Regular Java CLI tools such as `jcmd`

### Loot tables

#### Changed functions

##### `set_contents`, `set_loot_table`

Added new mandatory field `type`. This type will be written into `BlockEntityTag.id`, to make sure this tag can be correctly migrated between versions

### Old world conversion

-   Worlds last saved before Minecraft 1.2 ("pre-anvil") now require conversion in a previous version of a game to be able to be opened
-   Conversion works best in versions 1.6.4 and before - worlds opened for the first time in later versions will have incorrect biome information

### Priority update setting

-   This setting determines which chunks sections are updated synchronously during a single frame.
-   The most conservative option "nearby" corresponds to the state before the update.
-   The new options "by player" and "none" significantly reduce stutters when placing or removing blocks (especially light sources), but can potentially cause rare visually noticeable delays in world updates.

### Spawner data changes

-   Spawners now support the `custom_spawn_rules` NBT in the `SpawnData` field and the `SpawnPotentials` list
-   `custom_spawn_rules` currently may contain fields `block_light_limit` and `sky_light_limit` - both are integer ranges with fields `min_inclusive` and `max_inclusive`
-   To make `SpawnPotentials` format similar to other weighted lists, structure was changed to `{weight: <int>, data: <previous contents without 'Weight', 'Entity' renamed to 'entity'>}`
-   To accomodate that change, previous contents of `SpawnData` were moved to `SpawnData.entity` (making format of that field same as elements of `SpawnPotentials.data`)

Example:

    SpawnData: {
        entity: {
            id: "minecraft:cow"
        },
        custom_spawn_rules: {
              sky_light_limit: {min_inclusive: 10, max_inclusive: 15}
        },
    }
    SpawnPotentials: [
      {
        data: {
          custom_spawn_rules: {
              block_light_limit: {min_inclusive: 0, max_inclusive: 15}
          },
          entity: {id: "minecraft:pig"},
        },
        weight: 2
      },
      {
        data: {
          custom_spawn_rules: {
              block_light_limit: {min_inclusive: 5, max_inclusive: 10},
              sky_light_limit: {min_inclusive: 10, max_inclusive: 15}
          },
          entity: {id: "minecraft:panda"}
        },
        weight: 1
      }
    ]

Now with twice as much Java version.

Starting with this snapshot, Candles, Bundles, and Sculk Sensors are only accessible through commands. We do not feel that they are at the quality we want for Part 1 of the Caves & Cliffs release. To keep trying these features out in survival mode, use the Preview data pack!

## Changes in 21w19a

-   The maximum length of item names in the anvil UI has been increased from 35 to 50
-   Made geodes significantly rarer
-   Unfinished items (Sculk Sensor, Bundle and Candles) have been removed from the creative inventory
-   Recipes for unfinished items (Bundle, Candles) have been removed

## Changes to the Caves & Cliffs Preview

Download the [updated datapack](https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/a6b56d6f14869646eb8d399e99a0149bdd954490/CavesAndCliffsPreview.zip).

-   The pack now includes recipes related to bundles and candles

## Technical changes in 21w19a

-   Upgraded to Java 16
-   Added `mineable/axe`, `mineable/hoe`, `mineable/pickaxe` and `mineable/shovel` block tags. Blocks with these tags can be destroyed more quickly with the matching tool.
-   Added `needs_stone_tool`, `needs_iron_tool` and `needs_diamond_tool` block tags. If a block requires the correct tool to drop, these tags determine which tier of that tool is required.
-   Changed the syntax of the `/item` command

### Java 16

Minecraft now uses a more recent version of Java. If you are using a default setup the Launcher will download and install the correct version. If you are using a custom Java setup or a third-party launcher, you will need to ensure that your Java installation is version 16 or above.

### Item command

New syntax:

-   `/item replace <target> with <item stack> [<count>]` - same as old `replaceitem`
-   `/item replace <target> from <source> [<modifier>]` - copies item for source to target(s), optionally applying modifier
-   `/item modify <target> <modifier>` - modifies item (without copying)

For example, `/item replace block ~ ~ ~ container.0 from entity @s enderchest.0` will copy first item from player's enderchest to first slot of container player is currently standing on.

Hey-hoo! Will you look at that! It's Wednesday once again, which means we get to share updates about all the Minecraft bits and bobs. This week, we're distributing an ore distribution Snapshot for all you lovely Snapshot connoisseurs to feast upon. Enjoy!

## Changes in 21w18a

-   Infested Blocks are no longer instantly destroyed, and instead have half the destroy time of their non-infested counterpart.
-   Screaming goats will use their ram attack more often than other goats will

-   Reduced copper spawning a bit, to compensate for large ore veins
-   Large ore veins are slightly more rare and slightly smaller on average. But the size varies a lot so you can still find huge ones.
-   Increased chance of finding raw ore blocks in ore veins
-   Cave carvers generate below y 0 in ocean biomes (they didn't before, it was an accident)
-   Increased the minimum size of noodle caves and carvers, to make them easier to traverse and less likely to break up into fragments.
-   Noodle caves no longer generate above y 30, so the surface should be less riddled with holes.
-   Removed deepslate blobs above y 0
-   Extended the vertical range of the smaller blobs of iron ore, to make it possible to find iron in caves near the surface.
-   Slightly reduced the amount of normal-sized iron blobs, to compensate for large ore veins and the increased range of smaller blobs.

-   Large Ore Veins have been tweaked
-   Added thinner, squigglier, and more claustrophobic variant of spaghetti caves

### Large Ore Veins

-   Ore veins are now slightly rarer and slightly smaller (but they are still large!)

Snapshot 21w16a introduces some changes to azaleas and dripstone. On top of that, we've tweaked the textures of raw ores. There are also a few additions to the Caves & Cliffs preview datapack.

## New Features in 21w16a

-   Azalea and Flowering Azalea can now be bonemealed to get an Azalea Trees
-   Added dripstone growth

### Dripstone growth

-   If a stalactite is hanging from a dripstone block with a water source above, it will slowly grow both the stalactite from above and a stalagmite from below
-   Growth speed is random but very slow, a single growth step can take several minecraft days
-   A stalactite will only grow up to 7 blocks long
-   A stalactite will only cause stalagmite growth if the floor or stalagmite below is within 10 blocks
-   If the stalactite tip is inside water it won't drip, and therefore won't trigger any growth
-   If the stalagmite tip is inside water it won't receive drops, and therefore won't be grown by a dripping stalactite. Same thing if there is any fluid between the two tips
-   A stalagmite or stalactite will never grow into a fluid

## Changes in 21w16a

-   Tweaked the texture of raw ores and raw ore blocks

### Ore veins

-   Ore veins are large, rare, snake-like underground ore formations
-   Copper veins form above height 0 and are mixed with granite
-   Iron veins form below height 0 and are mixed with tuff

## Technical Changes in 21w16a

-   Users who previously permanently declined server resource packs will now still be shown the pack prompt if the pack is mandatory (instead of being immediately disconnected)
-   The statistic for play time has been renamed to `play_time`
-   There is now a statistic for "Time with World Open" (`total_world_time`) that also includes time when the game was paused

In today’s snapshot, we’re making a few needed changes that directly relate to our [recent announcement](https://www.minecraft.net/article/a-caves---cliffs-announcement). If you haven’t yet read it, we strongly recommend you do. You can also check out [this Caves & Cliffs video](https://youtu.be/6YgKUZnUyak) from Agnes and Henrik to learn more about our plans for the update.

Even though some features will be released later than we’d planned, you can still try them out through a separate data pack. More information, as well as our latest tweaks, can be found here below.

## Caves & Cliffs World Generation

The riskier and technically more complex world generation changes for the Caves & Cliffs update will be shipped in a later update and have been switched off in this snapshot. This means:

-   World height has been switched back to the 1.16 levels
-   Noise caves and aquifers have been switched off
-   Cave and ravine carvers have been returned to their old settings
-   Crack carvers have been switched off
-   Ore distribution has been returned to the 1.16 setup
-   Copper now generates between the bottom of the world and height 192, being most common around height 96
-   Tuff now generates in blobs between heights 0 and 16
-   Worlds created in snapshot 21w05b or any earlier version can now once again be opened
-   Worlds created in any version between snapshot 21w06a and 21w14a can no longer be opened

### The Caves & Cliffs Prototype Data Pack

You can still try out the world generation for the later update using a datapack which activates the changes as an experimental custom world:

-   [Download the data pack](https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/643b1f8f7f71c74ffc913e8572f52fd5bca88282/CavesAndCliffsPreview.zip)
-   Launch the game, go to the "Create New World" screen, and click the “Data Packs” button
-   Drag the downloaded zip file onto the Minecraft window
-   The game will ask you if you want to add the data pack – click “Yes”
-   Click the play arrow on the data pack that just appeared in the list – this will move it to the list on the right-hand side of the screen
-   Click the "Done" button and continue creating your world as normal

Keep in mind that the world you create with the data pack will be flagged as experimental by the game, and such worlds are not guaranteed to work in future versions. Also, please note that you can’t add data packs that change the world generation to existing worlds, so you must create a new world to access the experimental features.

## New Features in 21w15a

-   Goats will ram anything that moves... and also armor stands

## Changes in 21w15a

-   A crinkly, crunchy sound now plays when Bone Meal is used
-   Reordered some blocks in the Building Blocks Tab in Creative Menu
-   Goats will avoid walking on powder snow
-   Creepers know not to mess with goats
-   The main menu background has been updated
-   Tweaked the textures of raw ore items
-   Just like other ore materials, you can craft a compact version with raw ore items in order to save inventory space

![Minecraft Snapshot 21w15a Texture Comparison](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/images/snapshot-21w15a-ore-texture-comparison.png) New raw ore textures in snapshot 21w15a. [Click here](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/snapshot21w15aoretexturecomparisonfull.png) for a link to the full resolution image.

### Building Blocks tab

-   All ores have been reordered to be in the same location in the creative inventory.
-   Compact forms of raw and refined underground materials have been reordered.

## Technical Changes in 21w15a

-   Added the Marker entity
-   Added `/debug function`
-   `selector` and `nbt` chat components can now configure separators between elements
-   Servers can now customize a message to display when prompting players about custom resource packs

### Markers

Markers are a new type of entity meant for custom use cases like map making and data packs.

-   Only exist on the server side, are never sent to clients
-   Do not do any updates of their own
-   Have a `data` compound field that can contain any data

### `/debug function`

New debug subcommand executes command with same syntax as function

-   Every executed command, message (even if it would be normally invisible), result or error is stored to file
-   Cannot be run from inside functions

### Chat component separators

-   Components that print lists of names, like `selector` or `nbt` can now override separator (`", "` by default) with `separator` element
-   Examples:
    -   `{"selector": "@e[type=chicken]", "separator": "|"}`
    -   `{"nbt": "CustomName", "entity": "@e[type=chicken]", "interpret": true, "separator": {"text": "*", "color": "red"}}`

### Custom server resource packs

When `require-resource-pack` is used in `server.properties`, there's now an option for servers to add a custom message.

-   A dedicated server can configure additional message to be shown on resource pack prompt (`resource-pack-prompt` in `server.properties`, expects chat component syntax, can contain multiple lines)

A new snapshot is ready to be served, although somewhat… raw. Gordon Ramsey would be furious. Please don’t tell him, we don’t want to be called donuts. :(

Most of us have just gotten back from being off for a few days during Easter, so this snapshot is a bit on the smaller side.

## New Features in 21w14a

-   Added Raw Copper, Raw Iron and Raw Gold items
-   Tuff blobs can now be found between heights 0 and 16

### Smeltable Ore Drops

-   Ore blocks from old worlds and silk-touched ore blocks will continue to be smeltable
