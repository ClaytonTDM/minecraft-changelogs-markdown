### Happy Ghast

The Happy Ghast is a new mountable flying mob.

#### Dried Ghast Block

-   The Dried Ghast block is found in Nether Fossil structures and is the first stage of the Happy Ghast mob
-   Can be crafted with 1 Soul Sand block and 8 Ghast Tears
-   When waterlogged, it undergoes 3 hydration level changes over approximately 20 minutes until it spawns a Ghastling mob
-   The hydration level decreases when it is no longer waterlogged, using the same timescale
-   The hydration level is not preserved when mined
-   Makes sounds and shows particles depending on its hydration level
-   The Dried Ghast block emits a vibration frequency of 11 when its block state changes

![A Dried Ghast block underneath a Nether Fossil in a Soul Sand Valley. In the background two players are battling angry Ghasts.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/1.21.6hydrationscaled.jpg)

#### Ghastling Mob

-   The Ghastling is a young version of the Happy Ghast mob
-   Spawns from a Dried Ghast block that has continuously been waterlogged for about 20 minutes
-   After spawning, the Ghastling will try and follow:
    -   Players within a 16-block radius or
    -   An adult, non-aquatic passive mob or some of the neutral mobs within a 16-block radius
-   If no player or suitable mob is close around, the Ghastling will idle around within 32 blocks from its home position where it spawned or was last interacted with
    -   It will reset its home position if it is moved more than 16 blocks away from the border of its home position
-   Can be tempted and fed using Snowballs
-   Will grow up into a Happy Ghast after about 20 minutes, or faster if fed Snowballs

![In a Savanna village, a baby Happy Ghast is being lured with a Snowball by Efe. A stay cat is also quite curious of what Efe is holding in their hands.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/1.21.6ghastlingscaled.jpg)

#### Happy Ghast Mob

-   Can be equipped with a Harness and then be mounted by up to four players
-   Tempted by Snowballs and Harness
    -   The Happy Ghast can only be tempted with a Harness when it has no harness equipped
-   Slowly regenerates health, with regeneration speeding up during rain, snow or when flying at the same height as clouds
-   The first player that mounts the Happy Ghast will control it, sitting above it in the front seat
    -   When controlled, the goggles of the Happy Ghast flip down to cover its eyes
-   Players mounting after the first player are placed in slots on each side of it, starting clockwise from the first player
-   Pressing the sneak key dismounts the player on top of the Happy Ghast
-   If the Happy Ghast detects players standing on top of it, it ceases all movement and rotates to the closest cardinal direction
    -   This happens regardless of whether it has a Harness equipped or not
-   When mounted on the Happy Ghast, the third-person camera is further away from the player
-   When there are no players mounted or walking on the Happy Ghast, it starts its roaming behavior
    -   If players dismount midair, the Happy Ghast will descend towards the ground before it starts roaming
    -   The roaming behavior is similar to the Ghastling, except for the radius being 64 blocks
    -   When wearing a Harness, the Happy Ghast roams closer to the home position, within a 32 block radius
    -   When leashed, the Happy Ghast has a roaming distance of 10 blocks
    -   The Happy Ghast will try to stay close to blocks when roaming
-   Cannot be bred
-   Cannot enter boats
-   Has no panic behavior when taking damage

![Ari and Efe building a castle. Ari is standing on a Happy Ghast, using it to place blocks under the balcony.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/1.21.6buildfromhappyghastscaled.jpg)

#### Harness Item

-   The Harness is a new item that can be equipped on a Happy Ghast to allow players to ride it
-   The Harness comes in 16 different colors
-   Can be crafted out of 3 Leather, 2 Glass blocks and 1 Wool block
    -   The Harness will have the same color as the Wool block used when crafting
-   Can be re-dyed in the crafting grid
-   Can only be equipped on a Happy Ghast
-   Allows up to 4 players to mount the Happy Ghast
-   Can be removed from the Happy Ghast using Shears when no players are mounted

### Locator Bar

The Locator Bar is a new UI element that displays the direction of other players in the world.

-   If another player is in the world (and that player is not hiding) the Locator Bar will display in the same area as experience bar
    -   When experience is gained the experience bar will appear
    -   If there are no other players in the world the experience bar will display as normal
-   Facing other players within a 120 degree range will display those players as colored indicators on the Locator Bar
    -   Other players that are above/below the screen will also display an up/down arrow together with their indicator
    -   The indicator will change to different sized icons depending on how far away the other Player is
    -   Colored indicators are randomized for each player
        -   Operators can modify the colors of indicators with the `/waypoint` command
            -   e.g.: `/waypoint modify @s color red` to set an indicator to red
        -   Players on a team will override their default indicator color with their team color
-   Players can hide by crouching, wearing a mob head or a Carved Pumpkin, or using a Potion of Invisibility
-   Players in Spectator Mode are not visible on the Locator Bar
    -   However, spectators are visible to each other
-   The Locator Bar can be toggled off by setting the `locatorBar` game rule to `false`

![A new user interface for configuring your Realm.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/1.21.6realmsscaled.jpg)

### Projectile Targeting

-   The target tolerance margin of projectiles now changes over time
    -   Previously, all projectiles had a target tolerance margin of 0.3 blocks
    -   Now, all projectiles start with no margin for the first two ticks of their flight
    -   After that, the target margin will expand by 0.05 blocks per tick until it reaches the previous 0.3 blocks margin
    -   This allows for better precision close to the shooting player or entity, while still allowing for some collision leeway when the projectile is further away

### Splash Potions

-   Splash Potions distance to affected entities now depends on the closest distance between the entity hitbox and the splash potion hitbox where it landed
    -   This means that if an entity is hit directly by the splash potion, it will receive the full effect of the potion
    -   If the entities are grouped together, they will receive the same effect strength

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 80
-   The Resource Pack version is now 63

## Data Pack Versions 72 Through 80

-   Dimension Type definitions have a new optional field, `cloud_height` that indicates on what y-level the clouds start in the dimension
-   New `version` command has been added
-   New `datapack create` subcommand has been added
-   Added a way to display very simple dialogs to users
-   Added a Server-authoritative Waypoint broadcasting system for controlling the Locator Bar behavior for Players
-   Added `custom` - a new `click_event` action type for text components
-   New optional fields `can_be_sheared` and `shearing_sound` have been added to the `equippable` item component
-   Added `player_sheared_equipment` advancement trigger

### Commands

#### Added `version`

Prints the current version information on the server side.

-   Takes no arguments
-   Available in singleplayer or for server operators

#### Added `datapack create`

Creates a new empty directory data pack for the current world.

-   The supported pack version is always equal to one supported by the game
-   Available only to server owners
-   Syntax: `datapack create <id> <name>`
    -   `id` - new pack name, must be a valid directory name
    -   `name` - text component to be placed in `description` in `pack.mcmeta`

#### Modified `playsound`

-   Added new category `ui`
    -   Sounds in this category will continue playing when paused, similarly to `music`

#### Added `waypoint`

This is a new command for querying and modifying waypoints.

    waypoint list
    
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> color <color>
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> color hex <hex-color>
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> color reset
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> style <waypoint_style/resource>
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> style reset
    

Arguments:

-   `entity-selector`: For selecting entities that are transmitting as waypoints (see `waypoint_transmit_range` attribute)
-   `color`: Overrides the Locator Bar icon color for this waypoint
-   `hex <hex-color>` arguments are in web format (RRGGBB)
    -   Red is either `hex F00` or `hex FF0000`
    -   Cornflower blue is `hex 6495ED`
-   `style`: For changing the icon spriteset and selection distances
    -   `set <waypoint_style/resource>` changes the style to a specific asset under `waypoint_style/` (see Waypoint Styles section below)
    -   `reset` will restore the default icon behavior of the Locator Bar

### Waypoint Broadcasting

The Locator Bar works through a server-controlled Waypoint system. Waypoints are received by Players, and connections between Waypoints and Players are managed by the multiplayer server.

-   By default, all Players transmit a Waypoint from themselves, and all Players receive all Waypoints
-   Individual Players can have their transmission and receive ranges controlled by the `waypoint_transmit_range` and `waypoint_receive_range` attributes

### Dialogs

-   Added a way to display simple modal dialogs to a user
-   Dialogs are stored in a `minecraft:dialog` registry, but can also be defined inline
-   Dialogs are an experimental feature
-   To avoid user confusion, dialog screens are marked with a warning sign next to the title
    -   Clicking on this warning leads to a screen that explains to user that this screen is provided by custom content
    -   It also gives the user an option to leave the current world to avoid them being locked in an infinite loop of dialogs
    -   If a new dialog is received by the client while warning screen is visible, it will not replace it, but when user clicks the "Back" button, the new dialog will be restored instead
-   Dialogs can be displayed by server in `play` and `configuration` connection phases
    -   However, only inline registries are allowed in `configuration`, since registries are not yet available in that phase
    -   Additionally, `run_command` click event is not available in `configuration` phase
-   Dialogs by default will close after the Escape key is pressed
    -   When this happens, dialog will run action specific to dialog type described as "exit action" below
    -   This behavior is configurable
-   When the dialog screen is closed, the game goes back to previously displayed non-dialog screen or back to gameplay
    -   That means that new dialogs always replace already opened ones, if any
-   Dialogs can be configured to be accessible from Pause menu
    -   This replaces and expands the "Server Links" button added in previous versions
-   New key bind called "Quick Actions" has been added to allow accessing content-configured dialogs
-   Most dialogs follow a common layout, however exact contents depend on type:
    -   Header with title and warning button
    -   Body elements, scrollable if needed:
        -   messages and items
        -   inputs
        -   actions buttons
    -   Optional footer, contains main buttons and submit actions

> **Developer's Note**: _Dialogs are not supposed to fully describe any in-game UI, but just to allow custom content to display simple messages and get input from users. This feature is intentionally limited to match that use case._

![An example of a custom Dialog screen.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/1.21.6customdialogscaled.jpg)

#### Dialog Description Format

-   Dialogs are stored in `minecraft:dialog` registry that can be provided by a datapack

Fields:

-   `type` - one of dialog types from `minecraft:dialog_type` registry
-   `<type-specific>` - see below

##### Common Dialog Fields

-   Most dialog types share some fields. To avoid duplication, they are listed in this section

Fields:

-   `title` - screen title, text component
    -   Should be always visible on screen, no matter the specific type
-   `external_title` - name to be used for a button leading to this dialog (for example from Pause screen), optional text component
    -   If not present, `title` will be used instead
-   `body` - optional list of body elements or a single element, see below
-   `inputs` - optional list of inputs, see below
-   `can_close_with_escape` - can dialog be dismissed with Escape key, default `true`
-   `pause` - should the dialog screen pause the game in single-player mode, default: `true`
-   `after_action` - additional operation performed on dialog after click or submit actions, default: `close`
    -   `close` - closes dialog and returns to previous non-dialog screen (if any)
    -   `none` - do nothing, i.e., keep the current screen open
        -   only available if `pause` is `false` to avoid locking the game in single-player mode
    -   `wait_for_response` - replace the current dialog with a "Waiting for Response" screen
        -   this option is intended to prevent users from sending multiple actions on laggy connections
            -   servers are expected to eventually replace this screen with a new dialog
        -   to avoid accidental locking, a "Back" button will become active after 5 seconds
            -   clicking this button will continue as if the dialog was closed (i.e., game returns to the previous non-dialog screen, if any)
        -   "Waiting for Response" screen will unpause the game in single-player mode to avoid locking the game

##### Dialog Types

###### `minecraft:notice`

    -   `type` - value from `minecraft:dialog_action_type` registry
    -   `<type-specific>` - see below, depends on `type`

##### Static Dialog Action Types

All existing `click_event` actions (except for `open_file`) are included as dialog action types.

Uses same format as `click_event` on text components (but with `action` replaced with `type`) For example, when using `show_dialog`, the entry for action button will look like this:

    {
        "label": "some label",
        "action": {
            "type": "show_dialog",
            "dialog": "some:id"
        }
    }
    

##### `minecraft:dynamic/run_command` Action Type

-   This action will build a `run_command` event using a provided macro template
-   The macro will be expanded with string values from inputs
    -   For example, if the macro template is `some_command $(some_input)`, the string value from input with `key` of `some_input` parameter will be used for the template expansion
    -   Inputs not used in macro will be ignored, while macro parameters not matching any inputs will be replaced with an empty string

Fields:

-   `template` - a string with a macro template to be interpreted as a command

###### `minecraft:dynamic/custom` Action Type

-   This method will build a `minecraft:custom` event using all input values
-   All input contents will be sent together inside a compound tag, with tag value of each input put under id from `key` field of that input
-   Additional static fields can be added to payload

Fields:

-   `additions` - fields to be added to payload, optional compound tag
-   `id` - namespaced ID

##### Built-in Dialogs

The built-in datapack contains some custom dialogs to provide customization of specific screens used by the client.

###### `minecraft:server_links`

-   Replacement for the previously existing "Server Links" screen
-   Meant to simplify migration for servers that previously used this feature

###### `minecraft:custom_options`

-   Shows contents of `minecraft:pause_screen_additions` tag (see below)
-   Allows the user to select a specific dialog if this tag contains multiple entries
-   Note: Since this tag is meant for interoperability, any content that replaces this dialog should be careful not to hide other dialog providers

#### Dialog Command

-   New command has been added to show dialog to clients

Syntax:

-   `dialog show <targets> <dialog>` - show dialog to player(s)
    -   `<targets>` - player name, UUID or a player selector
    -   `<dialog>` - a namespaced ID from `minecraft:dialog` registry or inline dialog value as described above
    -   Returns the number of players in `targets` argument
-   `dialog clear <targets>` - clean dialog for player(s), if they have any visible
    -   `<targets>` - player name, UUID or a player selector
    -   Returns the number of players in `targets` argument

#### Pause Screen Configuration

-   A data pack can request some of the available dialogs to be accessible from Pause screen
-   This feature replaces the "Server Links" button and is placed on Pause screen according to the same rules
-   Buttons leading to dialogs exposed in this way will use label described in `external_title` field
-   This feature is configured by `minecraft:pause_screen_additions` dialog tag:
    -   If this tag is not specified or is empty but the server has sent `server_links` packet, the tag will be handled as if it contained `minecraft:server_links` dialog
        -   Note: this matches previous Server Links feature behavior
        -   If this dialog is removed, the tag remains empty
    -   If this tag is still empty, the button will not be visible ("Send Feedback" and "Report Bugs" buttons are visible instead)
    -   If this tag has a single element, the pause screen button will lead directly to that dialog
    -   If this tag has multiple elements, the pause screen button will lead to a `minecraft:custom_options` dialog which (by default) lets user select one of the tag elements
        -   If this dialog is removed, the button is will not be visible

#### Quick Actions Key Bind

-   A new key bind has been added that allows users to access a set of dialogs
-   Default key: `G`
-   This feature is configured by `minecraft:quick_actions` dialog tag
    -   If this tag is empty, the key bind will do nothing
    -   If this tag has a single element, the key bind will open that dialog
    -   If this tag has multiple elements, the key bind will lead to `minecraft:quick_actions` dialog which (by default) lets user select one of the tag elements
        -   If this dialog is removed, the key bind will do nothing
-   This option is intended for use in custom content and by servers, so this tag is empty in the Vanilla pack

### Text Components

#### Click Events

-   Users will now be prompted for confirmation before executing a command from the `run_command` click action in books and chat if the command can't be parsed or requires elevated permissions (i.e., higher than 0)

##### Added `minecraft:custom`

-   A new click action called `minecraft:custom` has been added
    -   When user clicks a component with this click action, the client will send a dedicated packet `minecraft:custom_click_action` to a server
    -   The intended use is as an alternative for `run_command` to be used by modded servers without worrying about having to add custom commands
    -   This packet has no functionality on Vanilla servers
    -   Fields:
        -   `id` - namespaced ID
        -   `payload` - optional tag field

##### Added `minecraft:show_dialog`

-   A new action called `show_dialog` has been added
    -   When user clicks this component, a dialog will be opened for them
    -   Fields:
        -   `dialog` - a namespaced ID from `minecraft:dialog` registry or inline dialog value as described above

### Game Rules

#### Added `locatorBar`

-   Default is `true`: enabling the Locator Bar
-   Changing to `false` will remove all existing Waypoints from all players

### Attributes

#### Added `camera_distance`

-   Default value: `4.0`
-   Modifies the distance at which the camera is placed away from the player or spectated entity when in a third-person view
-   If the entity being ridden has a larger `camera_distance` attribute, that distance will be used
-   This distance is multiplied by the `scale` attribute to get a final target camera distance

#### Added `waypoint_transmit_range` and `waypoint_receive_range`

-   Default: `0.0`, Minimum: `0.0`, Maximum: `60000000.0`
    
-   Players have a default transmission and reception range of 60,000,000
    
-   Mobs with a transmission range above zero will send waypoint packets to nearby receivers that are within that range
    
-   Similarly, receivers only receive waypoints that are inside their reception range (and receive nothing if that range is zero) Examples:
    
-   `/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_transmit_range base set 0` will prevent a player from transmitting (hiding them)
    
-   `/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_transmit_range base set 80` will only let a player transmit up to 80 blocks (hiding them from players further than that)
    
-   `/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_receive_range base set 0` will prevent a player from receiving (turns off their Locator Bar)
    
-   `/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_receive_range base set 120` will only let a player see Locator Bar dots that are within 120 blocks (hiding all players further than that)
    

#### Changed `flying_speed`

-   The `flying_speed` attribute now also applies to Ghasts and Happy Ghasts

### Data Components

#### `equippable` Item Component

-   Added a new optional field: `can_be_sheared` (boolean)
    -   If `true`, players can use Shears to remove this equippable item from a target mob by right-clicking, provided all other shearing conditions are satisfied
    -   If not specified, it defaults to `false`
-   Added a new optional field: `shearing_sound` (sound event)
    -   It's a sound event that plays when the equippable item is sheared
    -   If not specified, it defaults to the `item.shears.snip` sound event

#### `attribute_modifiers` Item Component

-   Added an optional `display` field to `attribute_modifiers` entries
    -   There are 3 `display` types:
        -   `default` - Current behavior of showing the calculated attribute modifier values on the tooltip
        -   `hidden` - Does not show the attribute modifier entry
        -   `override` - Replaces the shown attribute modifier text
            -   Contains a single field `value` for the text contents to show for this attribute modifier entry

    -   Interacting with leashes or riding may change the home position of the mob

#### `area_effect_cloud`

-   The `Particle` field has been renamed to `custom_particle`, and now always functions as an exact override for the default colored `entity_effect` particle
    -   The field will not be written if no override is specified
    -   The color will no longer be inherited from the potion contents when specifying the `entity_effect` or `tinted_leaves` particle types

#### `tnt`

-   The entity that primed the TNT is now stored in an optional `owner` field (UUID of Living entity)

#### `vex`

-   The owner of a Vex is now stored in an optional `owner` field (UUID of mob)

    -   `/waypoint modify <entity-selector> style set bowtie`
-   When the distance to the waypoint is less than `near_distance`, the first sprite in the list will be selected
-   When the distance to the waypoint is greater than `far_distance`, the last sprite in the list will be selected
-   Between this range, sprites will be selected based on the linear progress between the near and far distances

### Sounds

-   Added previously omitted Unifont glyphs for Private Use Areas
    -   Those glyphs are loaded as a separate sub-font `minecraft:include/unifont_pua` and are not included in any normally used font
    -   Characters in those areas are managed by Under-CSUR (Under-ConScript Unicode Registry), which adds various scripts not present in official Unicode set, like Tengwar or Sitelen Pona

#### `unihex` Font Provider

-   The `size_overrides` field is now optional (defaults to empty list)

### Equipment Assets

-   Added new `happy_ghast_body` layer type, rendering in the body slot of the Happy Ghast

### Item Models

-   Item model definitions now have a boolean field `oversized_in_gui` which is `false` by default
    -   If `true`, the item model will be allowed to be bigger than its item slot
    -   If `false`, the item model will be clipped to the item slot size when being rendered in gui
    -   This ability of items being rendered outside their slots should not be considered officially supported, it was temporarily restored as an exception since many servers are relying on it
    -   At some point in the future we hope to replace it with an officially supported way of achieving similar functionality
-   Introduced new item model `minecraft:player_head` to handle player profile texture loading and rendering
-   Removed support for `minecraft:profile` from `minecraft:head`

#### `minecraft:player_head` Special Model Type

-   Renders a default player texture when `kind` is `player` and no texture override is supplied
-   Fields remain unchanged

### Block Models

-   `elements[].rotation.angle` value in block models is no longer limited to multiplies of `22.5` degrees and can now be any angle from `-45` to `+45`

### Shaders & Post-process Effects

> **Developer's Note**: _Although it is possible in Resource Packs, overriding Core Shaders is considered as unsupported and not an intended Resource Pack feature. These shaders exist as part of the internal implementation of the game, and as such, may change at any time as the game's internals evolve. We understand that overriding Core Shaders is used for very cool Resource Pack features, many of which lack supported alternatives. We would like to provide better, supported alternatives in the future._

-   All built-in uniforms are now uniform blocks instead of opaque loose uniforms
-   Custom uniforms provided to post-process shaders are now uniform blocks
-   Uniform definitions inside json files are now per-block

#### Post-process Effect Definitions

-   Entries in the `targets` map have been expanded to support new properties
    -   New optional boolean field: `persistent` (default: `false`)
        -   If `true`, this render target will be persistent across frames
        -   The contents of the target will be cleared when the screen is resized
    -   New optional field: `clear_color` (default: `[0, 0, 0, 0]`)
        -   Format: integer ARGB value, or float array in order `[R, G, B, A]`
        -   When this target is created or cleared, it will be filled with this color
-   The `uniforms` values is now a list-per-block, instead of a global list
    -   e.g. `uniforms: { "UniformBlockName": [ { "type": "vec2", "value": [...] } ] }`
        -   The order of uniforms in a block **must** match the order in the shader
-   `name` as part of a uniform definition is no longer used
    -   We encourage setting it to help keep the json file organized/readable, but the game won't use it
-   `value` as part of a uniform definition replaces the old `values`, and the type depends on the `type` field
    -   This field is required
    -   `"type": "int"` needs `"value": 123` (a single int)
    -   `"type": "float"` needs `"value": 123.4` (a single float)
    -   `"type": "vec2"` needs `"value": [1.2, 3.4]` (two floats)
    -   `"type": "vec3"` needs `"value": [1.2, 3.4, 5.6]` (three floats)
    -   `"type": "ivec3"` needs `"value": [1, 2, 3]` (three ints)
    -   `"type": "vec4"` needs `"value": [1.2, 3.4, 5.6, 7.8]` (four floats)
    -   `"type": "matrix4x4"` needs `"value": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0, 15.0, 16.0]` (four rows of four columns of floats)
-   We do not validate that the uniform block is valid for a given shader, giving incorrect information will cause undefined and funky behavior

#### Post-process Effect Shaders

-   Instead of every uniform being an individual opaque type, they are now grouped in uniform blocks
    -   They will be set according to the pass definition in the json file, and may be shared across both vertex and fragment shaders
-   The list of sizes (all `vec2 *Size` uniforms) are now replaced with a single `SamplerInfo` uniform block
    -   This contains, _in order_, the size of the output texture followed by the size of every input texture
    -   The order of textures in the definition file will dictate the order of samplers in this uniform
    -   For most post chains this is just `OutSize` and `InSize` as before
    -   All sizes are `vec2`

##### `post/bits.fsh`

-   Expects a `BitsConfig` of `float Resolution` and `float MosaicSize`

##### `post/blit.fsh`

-   Expects a `BlitConfig` of `vec4 ColorModulate`

##### `post/blur.vsh` and `post/box_blur.fsh`

-   Expects a `BlurConfig` of `vec2 BlurDir` and `float Radius`

##### `post/color_convolve.fsh`

-   Expects a `ColorConfig` of `vec3 RedMatrix`, `vec3 GreenMatrix` and `vec3 BlueMatrix`

##### `post/invert.fsh`

-   Expects a `InvertConfig` of `float InverseAmount`

##### `post/rotscale.vsh`

-   Expects a `RotScaleConfig` of `vec2 InScale`, `vec2 InOffset` and `float InRotation`

##### `post/spiderclip.fsh`

-   Expects a `SpiderConfig` of `vec4 Scissor` and `vec4 Vignette`

#### Shader Fog Changes

-   The fog is now split into environmental and render-distance-based fog
-   Previously both those concepts were mixed in the same uniforms
-   Environmental fog is supposed to represent the "fogginess" of the environment the player is in
    -   e.g. lava, water, and now also atmosphere
-   Render distance fog is supposed to obscure the border of visible terrain
-   Environmental fog uses spherical distance to determine its intensity, render distance fog uses cylindrical distance
-   The resulting fog value for any given vertex is the maximum of both

#### `Globals` Uniform Block

-   Available through `#moj_import <minecraft:globals.glsl>` for convenience
-   Most shaders are able to receive this uniform block, even if they don't normally use it
-   Contains `ScreenSize`, `GlintAlpha`, `GameTime` and `MenuBlurRadius` (new)
    -   `MenuBlurRadius` is the blur radius of the background when a menu is open

#### `Fog` Uniform Block

-   Available through `#moj_import <minecraft:fog.glsl>` for convenience
-   Most shaders are able to receive this uniform block, even if they don't normally use it
-   Contains `FogColor`, `FogEnvironmentalStart` (new), `FogEnvironmentalEnd` (new), `FogRenderDistanceStart` (renamed from `FogStart`), `FogRenderDistanceEnd` (renamed from `FogEnd`), `FogSkyEnd` (new) and `FogCloudsEnd` (new)
    -   `FogSkyEnd` is new and represents where the fog should end when drawing for the sky
    -   `FogCloudsEnd` is new and represents where the fog should end when drawing the clouds
    -   `FogRenderDistanceStart` is the render distance fog start
    -   `FogRenderDistanceEnd` is the render distance fog end
    -   `FogEnvironmentalStart` is new and represents the start of environment-based fog
    -   `FogEnvironmentalEnd` is new and represents the end of environment-based fog
    -   `FogShape` was removed. Render distance fog is now cylindrical and environmental fog is spherical

#### `Projection` Uniform Block

-   Available through `#moj_import <minecraft:projection.glsl>` for convenience
-   Most shaders are able to receive this uniform block, even if they don't normally use it
-   Contains `ProjMat` with no changes

#### `DynamicTransforms` Uniform Block

-   Available through `#moj_import <minecraft:dynamictransforms.glsl>` for convenience
-   Is no longer available to shaders that do not normally use it
-   Contains `ModelViewMat`, `ColorModulator`, `ModelOffset`, `TextureMat`, `LineWidth`
    -   These are very likely to change in the near future
    -   The values of some of these are often hard coded and may not make sense for a given shader, i.e., `LineWidth` in any non-line based pipeline

#### `Lighting` Uniform Block

-   Available through `#moj_import <minecraft:light.glsl>` for convenience
-   Most shaders are able to receive this uniform block, even if they don't normally use it
    -   The values may not make sense if the shader wouldn't normally expect it, however
-   Contains `Light0_Direction` and `Light1_Direction`

#### `CloudInfo` Uniform Block

-   Only available to the cloud shaders (`rendertype_clouds.vsh`/`rendertype_clouds.fsh`)
    -   Contains `CloudColor`, `CloudOffset` and `CellSize` (new)
        -   `CellSize` contains the size of an individual cloud cell

#### `LightmapInfo` Uniform Block

-   Only available to the lightmap shader (`lightmap.fsh`)
-   Contains `AmbientLightFactor`, `SkyFactor`, `BlockFactor`, `UseBrightLightmap`, `NightVisionFactor`, `DarknessScale`, `DarkenWorldFactor`, `BrightnessFactor`, `SkyLightColor` with no change in behavior

It's time to experience new wonders of the Overworld as we release the Spring to Life drop, the first Minecraft game drop of 2025.

The Spring to Life drop brings more reasons to explore both near and far! Warm winds have swept across biomes, bringing new mob variants, ambient sounds, and lush plants for you to discover. Befriend fluffy pigs, marvel at glittering firefly bushes, listen out for whispers of sand, and delight in a blooming Overworld humming with new beginnings.

In this release we are also making the game tests system accessible through data packs with the new test command. And as usual, we continue to rebuild our engine to improve the experience for players and content creators. We are sure all those spare parts left on our floor can't be that important, right?

-   Creaking Hearts correctly placed between Logs have a new dormant texture during the day
    -   Dormant Creaking Hearts cannot spawn new Creakings or Resin
-   The transition between the awake and dormant states for Creaking Hearts, as well as the transition of Eye Blossoms is now based on the fixed day time
    -   All these behaviors are no longer affected by weather or dimension brightness

-   It is now possible to upload Hardcore singleplayer worlds to Realms

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 71
-   The Resource Pack version is now 55
-   A new entry point is present in the server jar: `net.minecraft.gametest.Main`
    -   Automatically starts a server and runs all available game tests
-   A new command line argument is available for the client: `--renderDebugLabels`
    -   Adds debug labels to relevant OpenGL objects, making debugging rendering easier for developers
-   Minor changes to chat network protocol

### Game Test Entry Point

This new entry point automatically starts a server, runs all available game test, and then exits.

Options:

-   `--help` - Shows usage information
-   `--packs <path>` - Set a folder of data packs to include in the world
    -   Any zip file or folder containing a `pack.mcmeta` file is included
-   `--report <path>` - Exports results in a JUnit-like XML report at the given path
-   `--tests <selection>` - Specify which tests to run with a selection - a wildcard expression matching namespace test instance IDs
    -   If omitted, or used with an empty ID, all tests will be run
-   `--universe <path>` - The path in which the test server world will be created
    -   Any existing folder will be replaced
    -   Default: `gametestserver`
-   `--verify <boolean>` - Enables test verification
    -   Runs the tests specified with `test` or `testNamespace` 100 times for each 90-degree rotation step
    -   Default: `false`

Example usage: `java -DbundlerMainClass="net.minecraft.gametest.Main" -jar server.jar --packs mytestpacks`

### Network Protocol

-   The clientbound `player_chat` packet now contains an index increasing for every message sent to the client
    -   The index starts at 0 when logging in (or is reset by configuration phase and the `login` packet)
    -   For every message, the server should increment this value by 1
    -   If this value updates in an unexpected way, the client will disconnect
    -   As the protocol requires that every chat packet reaches the client in produced order, the goal is to enable faster detection of missed/reordered chat messages for custom server developers
-   The serverbound `chat` and `chat_command_signed` packets now contain a checksum byte along with the "last seen" update
    -   This is a simple hash of the "last seen" signatures which should be reconstructed by the server, allowing quicker detection of desynchronized state
    -   This can be passed as `0` to disable the check, for compatibility with protocol translation

## Data Pack Versions 62 through 71

    -   Items in the `saddle` slot can apply attribute modifiers as with other equipment
-   Changes to `crafting_transmute`, `smithing_transform`, and `smithing_trim` recipe types
-   Trim pattern and trim material items are no longer specified in the trim registries, but instead in the recipes and items respectively

### Game Tests

![Kai is seen testing curious behaviors with the new test blocks.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/1.21.5qctest.jpg)

The Game Tests system is a new integrated system for testing aspects of the game. Each test is an asset defining some parameters for how the test gets executed, combined with a saved structure file containing a base setup.

Generally, the test framework expects to run tests in a separate superflat world.

#### Test Instances

![A game test is running, where a villagers is seen running through a maze to get to their bed.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/1.21.5villagertest.jpg)

Test instances are defined in the registry `test_instance`. They're small assets defining a test to run.

Fields:

-   `environment`: Namespaced ID of the test environment to run this test as part of
-   `structure`: The namespaced ID of the structure to use for the test
-   `max_ticks`: A positive integer representing the maximum number of ticks allowed to pass before the test is considered timed out
-   `setup_ticks`: Optional non-negative integer (default: `0`) representing a number of ticks to wait after placing the structure before starting the test
-   `required`: Optional boolean (default `true`) - whether the test is considered required to pass for the full test suite to pass
-   `rotation`: Optional rotation to apply to the test structure
    -   One of `none` (default), `clockwise_90`, `180` and `counterclockwise_90`
-   `manual_only`: Optional boolean (default `false`), set to `true` for tests that are not included as part of automated test runs
-   `sky_access`: Whether the test needs clear access to the sky
    -   By default (`false`), tests are enclosed in barrier blocks - if set to `true`, the top is left open
-   `max_attempts`: Number of attempts to run the test (default `1`)
-   `required_successes`: Number of attempts that must succeed for the test to be considered successful (default `1`)
-   `type`: The type of test - one of `block_based` and `function`

##### Function Tests

Function tests rely on built-in functions to run a test and indicate success or failure. They have one additional field:

-   `function`: The namespaced ID of the Test Function to run

See the "Using the Game Test Framework from Code" changelog section for more information.

##### Block Based Tests

Block based tests use Test Blocks in the test structure to run the test and indicate success or failure.

#### Test Environments

Test Environments are a way to group up tests and give them the right preconditions to run. A Test Environment is an asset in the `test_environment` registry. Each Test Environment definition has a `type` field that determines its setup:

-   `all_of` definitions apply the setup from several sub-definitions in the `definitions` field
-   `function` definitions use mcfunction files as setup and teardown
    -   `setup`: Optional namespaced ID of the mcfunction to use for setup, if any
    -   `teardown`: Optional namespaced ID of the mcfunction to use for teardown, if any
-   `game_rules`: definitions set any number of game rules
    -   `bool_rules`: A list of boolean game rules to set and the value to set
    -   `int_rules`: A list of integer game rules to set and the value to set
    -   Each rule is an object with two fields:
        -   `rule`: The exact name of the rule to set
        -   `value`: The value to set
    -   Game rules are reset to their default values after the test environment has completed
-   `weather` definitions sets the weather state
    -   `weather`: The weather to set - one of `clear`, `rain` and `thunder`
-   `time_of_day` definitions set a given time of day
    -   `time`: The time of day to set in number of ticks, as a non-negative integer

The game provides a single, empty Test Environment by default: `minecraft:default`.

#### Test Blocks

The Test Block is a block used for implementing a block-based tests. It has four modes:

-   `start`: Triggers a redstone pulse when the test starts
-   `log`: Logs a message to the log file when powered by redstone
-   `fail`: Fails the test when powered by redstone
-   `accept`: Completes the test when powered by redstone

Block-based tests are required to have at least one `start` block and one `accept` block in the structure.

#### The `test` Command

The `test` command is a new command used to create and run tests.

Syntax:

    test clearall [<radius>]
    test clearthat
    test clearthese
    
    test create <test> [<width>] [<height> <depth>]
    
    test locate <selector>
    
    test resetclosest
    test reseetthese
    test resetthat
    
    test pos [<variable>]
    
    test run <selector> [<numberOfTimes>] [<untilFailed>] [<rotationSteps>] [<testsPerRow>]
    test runclosest [<numberOfTimes>] [<untilFailed>]
    test runfailed [<numberOfTimes>] [<untilFailed>] [<rotationSteps>] [<testsPerRow>]
    test runmultiple <selector> [<amount>]
    test runthat [<numberOfTimes>] [<untilFailed>]
    test runthese [<numberOfTimes>] [<untilFailed>]
    
    test stop
    
    test verify <tests>
    

Parameters:

-   `radius`: The radius to clear tests within
-   `test`: The namespaced ID of a test
-   `selector`: A wildcard-enabled selector for test IDs
    -   Supports `*` and `?` for matching namespaced IDs
    -   If namespace is not supplied, defaults to `minecraft`
    -   Examples:
        -   `*:*` - matches all IDs
        -   `*` - matches everything in the `minecraft` namespace
        -   `custom:folder/*_test_?` - matches IDs in the `folder` folder of the `custom` namespace, with a prefix followed by `_test_` followed by a single valid character
-   `width`: The width of the test structure - if omitted, `5` is used
-   `height`: The height of the test structure - if omitted, the width is used
-   `depth`: The depth of the test structure - if omitted, the width is used
-   `variable`: The variable name to include in the copied code snippet
-   `numberOfTimes`: The number of times to repeat each test - if omitted, `1` is ued
-   `untilFailed`: Boolean (default `false`) noting that the test should be stopped as soon as one iteration fails
-   `rotationSteps`: Number of extra 90 degree steps to apply to the test - if omitted, `0` is used
-   `testsPerRow`: Number of tests to place per row in a grid layout - if omitted, `8` is used

##### `test clear*`

These subcommands clear the structures and blocks associated with the selected tests.

##### `test create`

This subcommand creates a test setup in the current location for the given test, preparing for a structure of the given size. This gives a starting point for creating the structure for the test.

##### `test locate`

Attempts to locate the given test. Note that only loaded chunks are searched.

##### `test reset*`

These subcommands reset the structures for the selected tests, removing any surrounding barriers and placing the structure in from scratch.

##### `test pos`

Shows the local coordinates to the block pointed at in the test. If the optional variable name is specified, this variable name is used in a code fragment obtained by clicking on the coordinates in the output message.

##### `test run*`

Runs one or more tests. If multiple tests are run at once, they are placed in a grid and run in parallel, although only up to a certain limit. Beyond that limit, tests are run in rounds where each round completes before any tests from the next round are started.

For each test, loads the given structure and runs the associated test. Each test location will have a beacon beam showcasing the test status.

-   Gray beacon = in progress
-   Red = fail (required test)
-   Orange = fail (optional test)
-   Green = success

If a test fails, the error is shown on a lectern book and an overlay.

Note that Game Tests are designed to run on standard superflat worlds. The area around each test is replaced with stone when it runs, and the running test is encased in barrier blocks.

##### `test stop`

This stops all running tests. Note that gameplay events triggered by tests may still remain.

##### `test verify*`

Verifies one or more tests by running multiple instances of the same test.

#### Test Instance Blocks

To run a test in a world, a Test Instance Block is used. This type of block represents the test as placed in the world and is used to interact with that test, to save the structure, reset or run the test.

Using the `test` command to run or create a test will also place a Test Instance Block to control that test.

#### Using the Game Test Framework from Code

The Game Test Framework can also be used from code in a more versatile manner than block-based tests. For this to work, you need to mod the game to add your test functions to the `test_function` registry (`Registries.TEST_FUNCTION`).

Hook into some startup method (pre-registry bootstrap) to add your loader - call `TestFunctionLoader.registerLoader()` with an implementation of `TestFunctionLoader`. Your implementation can then use the provided `register` consumer to register test functions with their namespaced IDs. This namespaced ID can then be referenced in a `function` type Test Instance.

A test function is a `Consumer<GameTestHelper>`, using that `GameTestHelper` instance to manipulate the world and make assertions about the state of the resulting world.

The helper can be used to summon mobs, set blocks, query for blocks and entities and assert the state of the test. Most `GameTestHelper` methods take test-local coordinates, which you can also find using `/test pos`.

Example code that might go along with a test structure with a locked hopper containing a Cod, pointed into a Furnace:

    public void furnaceSmeltsItem(final GameTestHelper helper) {
        helper.setBlock(0, 4, 0, Blocks.AIR);
        helper.succeedWhen(() -> helper.assertContainerContainsSingle(new BlockPos(0, 0, 0), Items.COOKED_COD));
    }
    

More complicated setups will often use `helper.startSequence()` to model sequences of events that must happen.

As opposed to block-based tests, function tests failing will often produce more helpful error messages including the location of whatever failed and what was expected at that location.

### Game Rules

#### `allowFireTicksAwayFromPlayer`

-   When `true`, fire and lava can spread fire outside the 8 chunk range of a player
-   Note: the fire and lava blocks must still be in simulation distance to spread
-   Default value: `false`

#### `tntExplodes`

-   When `false`, TNT will not explode and cannot be ignited
-   Default value: `true`

### Uniform Variant Selection

-   Variants that have spawn rules now use a uniform approach for selection
-   Selection process:
    -   Every variant has a field `spawn_conditions` that contains a list of entries
    -   Every entry has a condition and an integer priority
    -   Conditions for all variants for given entity type are evaluated for the position that entity is being spawned
    -   Entries with a priority lower than the maximum priority of remaining entries are removed
    -   The game randomly picks one entry out of the remaining ones
    -   If no conditions are remaining, the variant remains unchanged from default for that entity
-   Entry format:
    -   `priority` - integer
    -   `condition` - optional structure
        -   Fields:
            -   `type` - see below for values
            -   Additional fields are dependent on `type`
        -   If this field is not present, the condition is always true

#### Spawn Conditions

##### `minecraft:biome`

-   Checks if entity is spawning in specific biomes
-   Fields:
    -   `biomes` - single entry, list or a tag describing biomes

##### `minecraft:moon_brightness`

-   Checks if the current moon brightness is within a certain range
-   Fields:
    -   `range` - floating point range (a single number or an object like `{"min": 1, "max": 2}`)

##### `minecraft:structures`

-   Checks if the entity is spawning in specific structures
-   Fields:
    -   `structures` - single entry, list or a tag describing structures

### Data-driven Mob Variants

    -   `death_sound`
    -   `growl_sound`
    -   `hurt_sound`
    -   `pant_sound`
    -   `whine_sound`

### Commands

-   SNBT literals now accept heterogeneous lists
-   `/data` can now create and modify heterogeneous lists transparently
-   The `/setblock`, `/fill`, `/clone`, and `/place` commands now support a "strict" placement mode
-   `/setblock` and `/fill` have updated handling of block entities
-   The `horse.saddle` item slot has been renamed to `saddle`, and now supports any entity that can equip a Saddle
-   Text Components in commands such as `/tellraw` or `/title` are now specified with SNBT instead of JSON
-   Text Style in the `/scoreboard` command when specifying the `styled` number format is also now specified with SNBT instead of JSON
-   Text Component arguments in `/bossbar`, `/scoreboard` and `/team` commands are now resolved before use (in the context of entity the held in `@s`)

#### Changes to `/setblock`, `/fill`, `/clone`, and `/place`

-   The behavior of `setblock` and `fill` commands have changed in how they handle block entity data:
    -   If the block entity data is not specified, and the existing block has data, the block entity data will be preserved
    -   If the block entity data is specified, the block entity data will be set to that specified value
    -   To clear block entity data explicitly, you must now specify the block entity data as `{}`
    -   The operation is now successful if either the block state changed or the block entity data changed
-   `fill`, `clone`, `setblock` and `place template` accept a new option: `strict`
    -   If specified, the command will place blocks as-is without triggering block updates or shape updates
-   The `replace` option in the `fill` command is no longer terminal, and can be followed with additional options
-   New syntax for commands to use the new `strict` option, and more flexible use of `replace`:
    -   `fill <from> <to> <block> keep`
    -   `fill <from> <to> <block> [replace <filter>]? [strict|destroy|hollow|outline]?`
    -   `clone [from <sourceDimension>]? <begin> <end> [to <targetDimension>]? <destination> [strict]? [[replace|masked|filtered <filter>] [force|move|normal]?]?`
    -   `setblock <pos> <block> [destroy|keep|replace|strict]?`
    -   `place template <template> [<pos> [<rotation> [<mirror> [<integrity> [<seed> [strict]?]?]?]?]?]?`

### NBT Changes

-   Any interface with NBT data within the game (SNBT representation, `/data`) now supports heterogeneous lists, i.e. ones where elements are not of the same type
    -   Inserting or replacing into a list of a different type with `/data` will no longer give an error
    -   Inserting into an array type (e.g. `[I;1,2,3]`) is still type-restricted
    -   This means that the "wrapper" objects previously used to represent heterogeneous lists will no longer be observable by in-game means
-   `/data` can no longer traverse paths with an empty key (e.g. `/data get ... foo.''.bar`)
-   The NBT file format is unchanged:
    -   Heterogeneous lists are transformed before storage to bypass NBT constraints
    -   Example transform: `['a', {'b':3}]` is stored as `[{'':'a'},{'b':3}]`
    -   Existing external tools will still be able to read NBT files as before, but heterogeneous lists will be displayed in the transformed form
-   No data produced by the game has changed: objects such as Text Components were already producing heterogeneous lists in this form
-   Note: these wrapper objects may never be observed in-game, they are only relevant to developers working with the NBT file or network format directly

### SNBT Changes

-   The text format for describing object-like data in commands (like NBT, text components, predicates, etc.) has been extended
-   To simplify input of data and macro use, SNBT now also supports following operations:
    -   `bool(arg)` - converts argument to boolean
        -   if argument is a boolean value, returns value directly
        -   if argument is a number value, returns `true` if it is non-zero
    -   `uuid(str)` - converts string representation of UUID to integer array

#### Number Format

-   Either whole or fraction parts of a float number can be omitted
    -   Examples: `.1` and `1.` are valid now
-   Float numbers now use E notation
    -   Example: both `1.2e3` and `1.2E3`, `1.2E+3`, `12000e-1` are now a valid way to represent `1200.0`
-   Integer numbers can now be prefixed with `0x` to represent hexadecimal numbers and `0b` to represent binary numbers
    -   Example: `0xbad` (equal to `2989`), `0xCAFE` (equal to `51966`), `0b101` (equal to `5`)
-   Non-zero integer numbers now can't start with `0`
    -   Normally it would mean number is in base-8, but we are restricting it to avoid accidental use
-   Numbers can now contain `_` character between sequences of digits (but not at the start or the end of sequence)
    -   Example: `0b10_01`, `0xAB_CD`, `1_2.3_4__5f`, `1_2e3_4`
-   `NaN`, `Inf` or hexadecimal float representation are NOT supported
-   Implicit infinite float values (like `1e1000`) are rejected
-   Type suffixes have been extended:
    -   Integer type suffixes (`b` or `B` - byte, `s` or `S` - short, `i` or `I` - integer, `l` or `L` - long) can now be prefixed with `s` (signed) or `u` unsigned
    -   New suffixes only affect the valid range when parsing - values are still stored as signed
        -   Example: `240ub` is equal to `-16sb`, while `240sb` does not parse
    -   When a suffix is used without `u` or `s`, it defaults to signed for decimal numbers and unsigned for binary and hexadecimal numbers
    -   Note: since `b` is also a valid hexadecimal digit, byte sized hexadecimal values can only be written with a signed suffix, like `0x11ub` or `0x11sb`

#### Strings

-   Quoted strings can now use escape sequences beyond `\'`, `\"` and `\\`:
    -   Unicode escapes:
        -   `\x` - two digit escape, like `\x42`
        -   `\u` - four digit escape, like `\u2603`
        -   `\U` - eight digit escape, like `\U00002603`
        -   `\N{<name>}` - named Unicode character, like `\N{Snowman}`
    -   Built-in escape sequences:
        -   `\b` - backspace, Unicode `\x08`
        -   `\s` - space, Unicode `\x20`
        -   `\t` - horizontal tab, Unicode `\x09`
        -   `\n` - linefeed, Unicode `\u0a`
        -   `\f` - form feed, Unicode `\u0c`
        -   `\r` - carriage return, Unicode `\u0d`
-   Unquoted strings now can't start with `0-9`, `.`, `+`, `-` to avoid accidental collision with numbers

#### Number Arrays

-   Values in arrays (`[B;]`, `[I;]`, `[L;]`) without a suffix are now assumed to have suffix matching the type of the array
    
    -   Example: `[B;1,2]` is equivalent to `[B; 1b, 2b]`
-   Arrays can now also accept types smaller than the array type
    
    -   Example: `[I;1b,2s,3]` is valid and equivalent to `[I;1i,2i,3i]`

#### Lists

-   Lists now accept trailing commas
    -   Example: `[1,2,]` is valid and equivalent to `[1,2]`
    -   Only one trailing comma is allowed, and it must come after a valid element - both `[,]` and `[1,,]` are invalid

#### Compounds

-   Compounds (maps) now accept trailing commas
    -   Example: `{a:b,}`
    -   Only one trailing comma is allowed, and it must come after a valid key-value pair - both `{,}` and `{a:b,,}` are invalid

### Text Component Data Format

-   Text Components are no longer stored as JSON wrapped by a string
-   The format itself is the same as before, but inlined directly into the outer structure
    -   For example, the item component `minecraft:custom_name="{\"text\":\"Renamed item\"}"` will become `minecraft:custom_name={text:'Renamed item'}`
-   This includes Text Components passed as arguments to commands such as `/tellraw` or `/title`
    -   For example, `/tellraw @s {"text":"Hello world"}` may become `/tellraw @s {text:'Hello world'}`
-   Note: in the case where Text Components are embedded in NBT, no distinction exists between boolean and integer types
    -   To pass boolean arguments to translations, you must use the string form
-   For Text Components with the `nbt` type and `interpret` set to `true`, Text Components will be parsed from the given NBT directly rather than converting to a string and parsing as JSON
-   The format of hover and click events has been updated

#### Hover Events

-   The `hoverEvent` field has been renamed to `hover_event`
-   The legacy `value` field (which was parsed from a rendered text component) is no longer supported
-   For the `show_text` action:
    -   The `contents` field has been renamed to `value`
    -   e.g. `{action:'show_text',contents:'Hello world'}` becomes `{action:'show_text',value:'Hello world'}`
-   For the `show_item` action:
    -   The `contents` field has been inlined
    -   e.g. `{action:'show_item',contents:{id:'minecraft:stick',count:2}}` becomes `{action:'show_item',id:'minecraft:stick',count:2}`
    -   If contents was specified only as an item id, it is replaced with the full format and inlined
    -   e.g. `{action:'show_item',contents:'minecraft:stick'}` becomes `{action:'show_item',id:'minecraft:stick'}`
-   For the `show_entity` action:
    -   The `contents` field has been inlined
    -   The `id` field has been renamed to `uuid`
    -   The `type` field has been renamed to `id`
    -   e.g. `{action:'show_entity',contents:{id:[I;0,0,0,0],type:'minecraft:pig'}}` becomes `{action:'show_entity',uuid:[I;0,0,0,0],id:'minecraft:pig'}`

#### Click Events

-   The `clickEvent` field has been renamed to `click_event`
-   For the `open_url` action:
    -   The `value` field has been renamed to `url`
    -   The click event will no longer parse if not a valid URI with either `https://` or `http://` schemes, instead of simply not working
    -   e.g. `{action:'open_url',value:'https://minecraft.net'}` becomes `{action:'open_url',url:'https://minecraft.net'}`
-   For the `run_command` action:
    -   The `value` field has been renamed to `command`
    -   The click event will no longer parse if the command contains disallowed characters, instead of simply not working
    -   It is no longer required that the specified `command` field has a `/` prefix
    -   e.g. `{action:'run_command',value:'/tp @e @s'}` becomes `{action:'run_command',command:'/tp @e @s'}`
-   For the `suggest_command` action:
    -   The `value` field has been renamed to `command`
    -   The click event will no longer parse if the command contains disallowed characters, instead of simply not working
    -   e.g. `{action:'suggest_command',value:'/help'}` becomes `{action:'suggest_command',command:'/help'}`
-   For the `change_page` action:
    -   The `value` field has been renamed to `page`
    -   The `page` value now requires a positive integer instead of a string
    -   e.g. `{action:'change_page',value:'1'}` becomes `{action:'change_page',page:1}`
-   The `copy_to_clipboard` format is unchanged

### Entity Data

-   Custom data (previously present only on Marker) is now available on all entities
    -   It's exposed as a `minecraft:custom_data` component, so it can be set by spawning items and matched by predicates
    -   The component is currently stored in a field called `data`, which will be changed in the future when more proper storage for entity components is introduced
    -   It's stored only if it's non-empty
-   Updated and unified formats for storing equipment-related data on entities
-   The `Owner` field of tamed animals is no longer restricted to referencing Players
-   The `Health` and `Air` fields now default to their respective maximum value if not specified
-   The `Tags` and `FallFlying` fields will no longer be preserved if removed
-   The `FallDistance` field has been changed from float to double and is now called `fall_distance`
-   The `SleepingX`, `SleepingY`, and `SleepingZ` fields have been collected into a single `sleeping_pos` field
-   `Pos`, `Motion`, and `Rotation` values without the correct number of components (3, 3, and 2 respectively) will now be fully discarded, instead of only selecting the specified components
    -   e.g. `sleeping_pos: [I;1,2,3]`
-   Block States in the entity data of Arrows, Minecarts, Block Displays, Endermen, Falling Blocks, Primed TNT, or Piston Moving Blocks are no longer allowed to be specified as an empty object
-   Many tweaks to entity data formats of specific entities

#### Equipment Data

-   The `ArmorItems`, `HandItems`, and `body_armor_item` fields have been merged into an `equipment` field
    -   Format: map between equipment slot type and item stack
        -   Valid equipment slots: `head`, `chest`, `legs`, `feet`, `mainhand`, `offhand`, `body`, `saddle`
    -   If not specified or removed, the entity will have no equipment
    -   e.g. `equipment:{chest:{id:'minecraft:diamond_chestplate'}}`
    -   This affects all mobs and Armor Stands
    -   The armor and off-hand equipment of Players is now also stored in the `equipment` field (although items written into the Inventory using armor and off-hand slot numbers still work)
-   The data format of saddles has been unified between mobs such as Horses and Pigs, becoming a new kind of equipment slot (and stored in the `equipment.saddle` field)
    -   This is a pure rename from the previous `SaddleItem` in Horse-like mobs
    -   This also replaces the boolean `Saddle` flag from Pigs and Striders
    -   The Saddle dropping on death is now affected by the `drop_chances` field, as with other equipment slots
-   The `ArmorDropChances`, `HandDropChances`, and `body_armor_drop_chance` fields have been merged into a `drop_chances` field
    -   Format: map between equipment slot type and chance value
    -   If not specified or removed, chances will be assumed as default (`0.085f`)
    -   e.g. `drop_chances:{chest:0.1,feet:1.0}`
-   Drop chances with a default value will no longer be stored, and the `drop_chances` field is removed entirely if all defaults

#### `allay`

-   Removed redundant `CanDuplicate` field (controlled by `DuplicationCooldown`)

#### `area_effect_cloud`

-   Area Effect Clouds have a new field: `potion_duration_scale` (float)
    -   If not specified, defaults to `1.0`
    -   The duration of the potion effect applied is scaled by this factor
    -   Area Effect Clouds created by Lingering Potions will have a scale of `0.25`
-   The `Duration` field now defaults to `-1` if not specified
-   If the `Duration` field is `-1`, the Area Effect Cloud will never run out
-   This means that an Area Effect Cloud summoned with no duration specified will no longer immediately disappear

-   Sheep now has a separate texture for its wool undercoat, which is dynamically recolored in-game
    -   The name of this undercoat texture is `sheep_wool_undercoat`

### Equipment Assets

-   Equipment assets may now define new layer types:
    -   `pig_saddle` - equipment layer for Pig saddles
    -   `strider_saddle` - equipment layer for Strider saddles
    -   `camel_saddle` - equipment layer for Camel saddles

    -   `entity/horse/horse_skeleton.png` -> `entity/equipment/skeleton_horse_saddle/saddle.png`
    -   `entity/horse/horse_zombie.png` -> `entity/equipment/zombie_horse_saddle/saddle.png`
-   Equipment layers configured to be dyeable will now show if the `dyed_color` component is present on the item, even if the item is not in the `#dyeable` tag

### Item Models

#### `minecraft:component` Select Property

-   New data source has been added to `select` item model: `component`
-   Returns value of component on item, if any
-   Fields:
    -   `component` - namespaced ID of component type
-   Possible values: depends on component type
    -   Example: if `component` is set to `minecraft:wolf/collar`, list of cases will accept dye colors, like `lime`
    -   If value comes from registry and current datapack does not provide it, entry will be silently ignored

#### `minecraft:component` Boolean Property

-   New conditional model property has been added to `condition` item model: `component`
-   Uses component predicates (like ones used in item predicates) to match item components
    -   However, instead of encoding them as a map of `<predicate type>:<predicate value>`, a single predicate is encoded in two fields
-   Fields:
    -   `predicate` - type of component predicate (member of `minecraft:data_component_predicate_type` registry)
    -   `value` - predicate-specific value

### Atlas

#### `minecraft:paletted_permutations` Sprite Source

-   New field:
    -   `separator` - optional string (default: `_`) - value to be used when joining texture and permutation names to produce sprite name

### Shaders & Post-process Effects

> **Developer's Note**: _Although it is possible in Resource Packs, overriding Core Shaders is considered as unsupported and not an intended Resource Pack feature. These shaders exist as part of the internal implementation of the game, and as such, may change at any time as the game's internals evolve. We understand that overriding Core Shaders is used for very cool Resource Pack features, many of which lack supported alternatives. We would like to provide better, supported alternatives in the future._

-   Shader program definitions for core shaders and post-processing effects as JSON files have been removed
-   The shader programs themselves are still available and can be overridden
-   The post-processing effects are still configurable as JSON
-   "Global" uniforms may be defined in any shader, and the game will attempt to fill it
    -   Currently, these are: `ModelViewMat`, `ProjMat`, `TextureMat`, `ScreenSize`, `ColorModulator`, `Light0_Direction`, `Light1_Direction`, `GlintAlpha`, `FogStart`, `FogEnd`, `FogColor`, `FogShape`, `LineWidth`, `GameTime`, `ModelOffset`
    -   The type of the uniform must match what it would normally be, or it'll be undefined behavior

#### Post-process Effect Definitions

-   The field `program` was replaced with `vertex_shader` and `fragment_shader`
    -   `<namespace>:<path>` will resolve to `assets/<namespace>/shaders/<path>.<vsh|fsh>`
-   `type` is now a required field for each `uniform`
    -   Possible values are currently `int`, `ivec3`, `float`, `vec2`, `vec3`, `vec4`, `matrix4`
-   `values` in each `uniform` is now optional
    -   Leaving it unset is not recommended and is used for runtime configuration of the blur effect
-   Leaving a uniform unspecified results in undefined behavior, you must specify each one that will be used by the shaders

### Item Rendering

#### Item Display

-   `firstperson_lefthand` and `thirdperson_lefthand` transforms are now rendered the same as when held in hand

#### Item Entity

-   When on ground, model size is now taken into account when determining hovering motion
    -   That means that models should never clip into the block below, no matter what size they are
-   Positioning of items in an item stack on ground now depends on model size and model type
    -   If model depth (Z coordinate) is below 1/16th of a block, item is rendered as flat stack of items
    -   Otherwise, the model is rendered as a cluster of items offset in all directions around center
    -   Previously, flat stack rendering happened only for models with `builtin/generated` parent

Shh! I'm writing this changelog from behind a Pale Oak tree – and I have to be very quiet because the Garden Awakens drop is finally here – and Creakings are spawning in Pale Gardens all across the Overworld! The Garden Awakens brings with it an eerie biome – the Pale Garden – which is carpeted in moss, filled with Pale Oak trees, and home to a unique flower called an Eyeblossom. It also brings a watchful hostile mob, the Creaking, as well as the secret to defeating (and spawning) it – the Creaking Heart! Facing up to a Creaking will also earn you Resin Clumps – another new block you can craft into Resin Bricks, or use to trim your armor. Was that everything? Oh! And we've also made some bug fixes. Now, let me see if I can back away slowly without this Creaking spotting me…

## New Features

-   Added Pale Garden Biome, Pale Oak tree, Pale Moss block, Pale Moss carpet, Pale Hanging Moss and Pale Oak woodset
-   Added the Creaking mob, Creaking Spawn Egg and Creaking Heart block
-   Added the Resin block family
-   Added Eyeblossoms

### Pale Garden

The Pale Garden is a biome variation of Dark Forest.

-   Pale Oaks generate here
-   Creaking Heart blocks can generate in Pale Oaks, causing Creakings to spawn at night

-   Pale Garden has no accompanying music
    -   If a player enters the biome while music is playing, the music will fade out
-   Using the seed 3515201313347228787 when creating a new world will spawn the player next to a Pale Garden ![In the moonlit canopy of a Pale Garden, an Enderman can be seen holding a Pale Moss block. A Creeper and a Creaking can also be seen in the distance.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/1.21.4canopy.jpg)

### Pale Oak Tree

Pale Oak trees are a new tree variant similar to Dark Oak trees.

-   Pale Oak Leaves drop Pale Oak Saplings that can be planted in a 2x2 configuration to grow Pale Oak trees
-   Player grown Pale Oak trees grow without any decorations
-   Naturally generated Pale Oak trees have Pale Hanging Moss hanging from the foliage, Pale Moss patches on the ground, and Creaking Heart blocks can generate in them

-   Wandering Traders can sell Pale Oak Saplings
-   Pale Oak Logs can be crafted into the Pale Oak woodset:
    -   Door
    -   Fence
    -   Fence Gate
    -   Plank
    -   Sign
    -   Hanging Sign

    -   Boat with Chest ![A player made building constructed out of the Pale Oak woodset and Resin blocks is atop of a mountain near a Pale Garden.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/1.21.4building.jpg)

### Pale Moss

Pale Moss Blocks are new blocks that work similarly to existing Moss Blocks, including a Carpet variant.

-   Pale Moss Blocks generate naturally in the Pale Garden biome
-   Wandering Traders can sell a Pale Moss Block
-   Pale Moss Carpet can be crafted from two Pale Moss Blocks
-   Pale Moss Carpet generates naturally in the Pale Garden biome
    -   When placed, Pale Moss Carpet grows up to two blocks on the solid faces of any block that borders it
    -   Pale Moss Carpet can be Bone Mealed to grow to full on all solid faces of any block that borders it

### Pale Hanging Moss

Pale Hanging Moss is a vine-like block that grows downwards.

-   Pale Hanging Moss generates naturally in the Pale Garden biome under the foliage of Pale Oaks
-   Pale Hanging Moss does not grow randomly, but can be Bone Mealed to grow
-   Pale Hanging Moss breaks instantly when mined
-   Pale Hanging Moss requires shears or silk touch tools to be obtained
-   Wandering Traders can sell Pale Hanging Moss

### Eyeblossoms

Eyeblossoms are new flowers that generate in the Pale Garden biome.

-   They exist in two variants: Closed Eyeblossom and Open Eyeblossom
-   Eyeblossoms transition between the two variants based on the time of day
    -   During the night, Eyeblossoms will become Open
    -   During the day, they will become Closed
    -   In dimensions that do not have a day/night cycle, they will remain as-is
    -   When transitioning, flowers will emit a particle effect and sound
-   Eyeblossoms planted on the ground will communicate with each other, helping nearby flowers to open or close
-   Open Eyeblossoms have glowing eyes during the night
-   Eyeblossoms can be obtained by Bone Mealing grass blocks in the Pale Garden biome
-   Bees get poisoned when they touch Open Eyeblossoms
-   Bees can be tempted with Open Eyeblossoms, but they get poisoned on player interaction instead of typical breeding/growing behaviour
-   Bees do not interact at all with Closed Eyeblossoms
-   Suspicious Stew made from Open Eyeblossoms will cause a Blindness effect
-   Suspicious Stew made from Closed Eyeblossoms will cause a Nausea effect
-   Gray or Orange Dye can be crafted from Closed and Open Eyeblossoms respectively
-   Wandering Traders can sell Open Eyeblossoms

### Creaking Mob

The Creaking mob spawns at night if there is a Creaking Heart block between two Pale Oak logs. This happens naturally in the Pale Garden biome where the Creaking Heart generates inside Pale Oaks.

-   A Creaking will activate if a survival or adventure mode Player is within 12 blocks of it and looks at it
-   A Creaking stays active while there is a survival or adventure mode Player within 32 blocks of it
-   An activated Creaking will not move if a survival or adventure player is looking at it
    -   It will also have full knockback resistance in this state
-   Creaking melee attacks deal 3 points of damage (1.5 hearts)
-   Creakings react to damage caused by mobs and projectiles only by swaying in place
-   Creakings are resistant to fire
-   Creakings ignore Cacti, Sweet Berry Bushes and Powder Snow and can walk through/over them
-   When attacked by Players or their pets, a particle trail is shown between the Creaking and the Creaking Heart block it is connected to
-   When the Creaking Heart block that the Creaking is connected to is destroyed, the Creaking is removed with a custom twitching animation
-   Creaking spawns are based on the day/night cycle and not affected by light levels
-   Creakings cannot enter Boats
-   The Creaking Spawn Egg will spawn a Creaking mob that is not connected to a Creaking Heart which:
    -   Persists through day and night
    -   Takes damage from attacks and other damage sources
    -   Has one point of health (half a heart)
-   Creakings spawned from a Creaking Heart cannot go through portals
-   Creakings spawned from a Creaking Heart cannot be named with a Name Tag
-   Players wearing a Carved Pumpkin on their head can look at a Creaking without it freezing in place
-   Illagers are scared of Creakings and will run away from them ![Sunny is walking through a Pale Garden, unaware that several Creakings are stalking them.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/1.21.4creaking.jpg)

### Creaking Heart

A Creaking Heart is a “living” block generating in Pale Oak trees, covered on all sides by Pale Oak wood logs. It can spawn a Creaking mob during the night when it is placed between two Pale Oak Logs, all aligned along the same axis.

-   Is active during the night and dormant during the day
-   Sends a trail of particles towards the connected Creaking when the Creaking gets hit by a Player or their pet
-   When a Creaking Heart block is destroyed, the connected Creaking is removed
-   The Creaking Heart decides to remove or replace the connected Creaking when:
    -   It turns day
    -   The Creaking is too far away from the Creaking Heart
    -   A Player intersects with the Creaking for a few seconds
-   Comparators attached to the Creaking Heart block will output a signal strength dependent on the distance to the connected Creaking
-   A Creaking Heart can be crafted with a Resin Block and Pale Oak Logs
-   A Creaking Heart block can be obtained by using a Silk Touch enchanted tool
-   Breaking a Creaking Heart without Silk Touch block will drop 1-3 Resin Clumps or more when using a Fortune enchanted tool
-   Naturally placed Creaking Hearts drop 20-24 experience when broken by a Player, with or without Silk Touch ![Sunny stands face-to-face with a Creaking, hitting it to figure out where the connected Creaking Heart block is.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/1.21.4heart.jpg)

### Resin

Added Resin Clump, Block of Resin, Resin Brick, and a family of Resin Bricks blocks.

-   Attacking a Creaking will cause its Creaking Heart to exude 2-3 Resin Clumps
    -   Resin Clumps appear on the sides of Pale Oak Logs that are close and are connected to the Creaking Heart
    -   The Creaking Heart is on cooldown and cannot produce more Resin Clumps for 5 seconds after an attack
-   Resin Clump blocks can be placed on any full face of a neighboring block
-   Resin Clump blocks can be waterlogged
-   Block of Resin is a storage block for Resin Clumps
-   Resin Clumps can be smelted into Resin Brick items
-   Resin Brick items can be used as a material for armor trimming
-   Resin Brick items can be crafted into Resin Bricks
-   Resin Bricks can be crafted into Resin Brick Slabs, Resin Brick Stairs, Resin Brick Walls, and then Chiseled Resin Bricks
    -   The Stonecutter can also be used to craft these items
-   Resin Clump and Resin Block does not require a tool to mine and are mined instantly
-   The proper tool for Resin Bricks family of blocks is a Pickaxe
-   Resin Clumps can be found in some Woodland Mansion loot chests

### New System for Pale Garden Ambient Sounds

Ambient sounds in the Pale Garden biome do not come from the biome itself, but are generated by blocks found in the biome.

-   Pale Hanging Moss emits subtle atmospheric sounds when it is attached to Pale Oak Logs or Pale Oak Leaves
-   Creaking Hearts emit a set of eerie sounds when they are active during the night and surrounded by Logs on all sides
-   Open Eyeblossoms placed on Pale Moss Blocks emit a soft, whispering sound

## Changes

-   Swords are no longer considered efficient tools for mining Moss Carpet
    -   Hoes remain the proper tools for mining Moss Carpets
-   Bees are now withered on player interactions with Wither Roses instead of typical breeding/growing behavior
-   Baby Cats and Wolves now get a collar with the color that is a mix between the parents collar color if possible
-   Added language support for Popoloca
-   The durations of the effects of Suspicious Stews have been aligned with those in Bedrock Edition:
    -   Saturation: 0.35 seconds (unchanged)
    -   Night Vision: 5 seconds (unchanged)
    -   Fire Resistance: 3 seconds
    -   Blindness: 11 seconds
    -   Weakness: 7 seconds
    -   Regeneration: 7 seconds
    -   Jump Boost: 5 seconds
    -   Wither: 7 seconds
    -   Poison: 11 seconds
-   Removed Herobrine

### Required Tools for Drops

> **Developer's Note**: _We made it so any block that drops when its support is broken will also drop when mined with any tool. It seemed unfair that breaking a block directly could destroy it if it was possible to obtain it with any tool just by breaking the block below!_

-   The following blocks that require support now always drop when broken with any tool: Bell, Lantern, Soul Lantern, all Copper Doors, Iron Door, Heavy Weighted Pressure Plate, Light Weighted Pressure Plate, Polished Blackstone Pressure Plate, and Stone Pressure Plate
-   The Brewing Stand now drops when broken with any tool
-   The Ender Chest now drops Obsidian when broken with an incorrect tool, instead of dropping nothing

### Mobs Picking up Items

Some changes have been made to how mobs decide to replace their equipped items with items on the ground

-   If the item belongs in an armor slot, replace the item if any of the following conditions apply
    -   The new item has a higher base armor value
    -   The new item has a higher base armor toughness value
    -   The new item has more enchantments
    -   The new item is less damaged
    -   The new item has a custom name while the old one doesn't
-   If the item belongs in the main hand slot, replace the item if any of the following conditions apply
    -   The new item is a preferred weapon while the old one isn't
        -   If the old item is a preferred weapon while the new item isn't, do not replace the item
    -   The new item has a higher base damage value
