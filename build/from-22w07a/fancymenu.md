Today we're happy to share snapshot 22w06a with you. It contains compliance updates for South Korean players and is Totally Teeming with Technical Tag Tastiness.

Happy Mining (in moderation)!

## Changes in 22w06a

If you’re playing in South Korea, we added gameplay timers and notices in compliance with gaming laws to help remind players to take occasional breaks from gameplay. For more information, please see [the FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/articles/360052763631).

## Technical Changes in 22w06a

-   Any type present in registries (blocks, items, biomes, etc.) can now have tags

### Universal tags

-   Tags can now be defined for any registry (blocks, items, biomes, etc. - see `registries.json` in report)
-   New tags are stored in datapacks under `tags` directory (same as old ones)
    -   Names of new tag directories are the same as registry names (so `/data/[namespace]/tags/potion` and `/data/[namespace]/tags/worldgen/biome`)
    -   Existing tags (`blocks`, `items`, `fluids`, `entity_types`, `game_events` and `functions`) keep their name (for now)
-   Some fields in worldgen structures that previously only lists of element ids now accept tags
    -   Those entries now accept `[id, ...]`, `id` (shortcut for `[id]`) and `#tag`
    -   Changed fields are:
        -   `feature.glow_lichen` configuration: `can_be_placed_on`
        -   `feature.spring_feature` configuration: `valid_blocks`
        -   `feature.simple_random_selector` configuration: `features`
        -   `block_predicate_type.matching_blocks`: `blocks`
        -   `block_predicate_type.matching_fluids`: `fluids`
        -   `biome`: inner list in `features`, map value in `carvers`
        -   `biome_source.checkerboard`: `biomes`
-   Some tag fields now require id to be prepended with `#` (however they are not yet accepting element list)
    -   `dimension_type`: `infiniburn`
    -   `feature.geode` configration: `blocks.cannot_replace`, `blocks.invalid_blocks`
    -   `feature.vegetation_patch`, `feature.waterlogged_vegetation_patch` configuration: `replaceable`
    -   `feature.root_system` configuration: `root_replaceable`
    -   `structure_processor.protected_blocks`: `value`

## Fixed bugs in 22w06a

-   [MC-105317](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-105317) Structure blocks do not rotate entities correctly when loading
-   [MC-239708](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-239708) Superflat world "Water World" preset settings are obsolete for the 1.18 update

Happy New Year! It's time for the first snapshot of 2022 to hit the shelves. This snapshot series will be leading up to the release of 1.18.2. With this release we aim to address a few issues before moving on and starting with the Wild Update snapshots.

This snapshot contains tweaks to the world seed input and adds a new `placefeature` command. On top of that, it also fixes a bunch of bugs.

Happy mining!

-   Any spaces before/after an inputted seed will now be trimmed
-   Ender chests are no longer gift wrapped around Christmas

## Technical Changes in 22w03a

-   The `locate` command now uses a namespaced id parameter
-   Added command: `placefeature`

### `placefeature`

New command that places a configured feature at a given location. Syntax: `placefeature <id> [pos]`

Parameters:
