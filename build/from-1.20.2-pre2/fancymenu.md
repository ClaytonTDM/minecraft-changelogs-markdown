# Minecraft 1.20.2 Pre-Release 2

Another pre-release this week with minor changes and some bug fixes.

## Recipe book search revert

We received a lot of great feedback on the changes to the Recipe Book search in the last pre-release, as well as a number of bugs. As we do not have time to address this feedback so close to release, we have reverted the change for now, but we may look into this again at a later time.

# Minecraft 1.20.2 Pre-Release 1

Are you pre-pared for Pre-release 1 of 1.20.2? Moving into pre-releases means that, moving forward, you won't see any significant changes besides bug fixes and tweaks until the next snapshot cycle. It also means that we will be releasing more frequently than just Wednesdays, so keep your eyes peeled! However, Pre-release 1 brings new changes to the 'Villager Trade Rebalance' experiment, updates to Recipe Book search, command changes, and a new game rule!

Happy crafting!

## Changes

-   The Recipe Book search has been updated with the following changes:
    -   The search will only match the beginning of any word in the item's name
        -   For example, searching for "tor" will still show Torch and Redstone Torch but not Daylight Detector anymore
    -   All recipes, including those that have not been unlocked, will now show up in search results
    -   This will enable experienced players to find the recipes they are looking for (even if it hasn't been unlocked yet) without overwhelming new players
-   Updated structure icons on explorer maps sold by Cartographers
-   When villagers unlock new trades, the order of those trades in the UI is now always random instead of sometimes being deterministic

## Technical Changes

-   The data pack version is now 18
-   Client options are now sent during the configuration network phase when joining a server

### Data Pack Version 18

This data pack version removes the recently introduced `execute if function` and `return run` functionality. Flaws with those commands (see bugs [MC-264595](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-264595), [MC-264699](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-264699) and [MC-264710](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-264710)) require some substantial changes to fix, which we do not want to make close to a release.

These commands will instead be reintroduced early in the next snapshot series when we can take the time to iterate on and test them together with pack makers.

-   Removed `execute if|unless function` command form
-   Removed `return run` command form
-   Numbers used as macro arguments are now always inserted without suffixes, regardless of numeric type
-   Added game rule `enderPearlsVanishOnDeath`, controlling whether thrown ender pearls vanish when the player that threw them dies (default `true`)

## Experimental Features

### Villager Trade Rebalance Part 2

This pre-release updates the Villager Trade Rebalance experiment. This experiment has no effect on normal worlds. If you want to try these changes, you must turn on the Feature Toggle in the Experiments Menu when creating a new world. You can find more information about Feature Toggles [here](https://www.minecraft.net/article/testing-new-minecraft-features/feature-toggles-java-edition).

Thank you to everyone that has sent in their suggestions and feedback regarding the experimental trade change! We are trying out these changes to rebalance the villager trade system and make it more fair and fun for everyone. However, these changes are not yet final, and they will stay as experimental features while we continue to work on them. We appreciate your feedback on these changes. Visit [this link](https://aka.ms/VillagerTradingFeedback) to share your thoughts! We have been following the discussions about the previous Librarian and Wandering Trader updates and look forward to seeing the conversation continue.

**Cartographer**

Before now, Cartographers only sold maps to the Ocean Monument and Woodland Mansion. In this experiment Cartographers can sell seven new maps as well. These new maps each point to a different village or structure and can be used to find seven different biomes. This will help players who want to quickly find a specific location without waiting until they come across it by chance.

Cartographers from different biomes will sell a different selection of maps. Starting from one village, it will be possible to find every other village type by following maps from village to village.

Cartographers now sell 7 new maps: Desert Village Map, Jungle Explorer Map, Plains Village Map, Savanna Village Map, Snow Village Map, Swamp Explorer Map, and Taiga Village Map.

**Armorer**

The Armorer's trades have been updated with many changes.

The biggest change is that buying diamond armor now requires paying a small amount of Diamonds as well as Emeralds. This is meant to make the Armorer's diamond armor trades less useful at the start of the game when players don't have any Diamonds, while still giving a powerful advantage to advanced players who have spent some time collecting Diamonds.

Early-game players will find Armorers useful as a great source of iron armor, Shields and Emeralds.

Other changes include:

-   Most master-level Armorers buy Iron Blocks (and pay very well for them)
-   Chainmail armor is exclusively sold by the secret Jungle and Swamp Armorers
-   The Savanna Armorer sells cursed diamond armor at reduced prices
-   The Taiga Armorer can swap one piece of diamond armor for another

**Structure Loot**

Certain Enchanted Books now have a high chance of generating in some structures:

-   Ancient Cities: Mending
-   Mineshafts: Efficiency (I to V)
-   Pillager Outposts: Quick Charge (I to III)
-   Desert Temples: Unbreaking (I to III)
-   Jungle Temples: Unbreaking (I to III)

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w33a

We are making some important updates to our Player Reporting Tool in this Snapshot to better protect the online safety of our players.

Playing Minecraft should be an inclusive and safe experience for everyone, which is why alongside in-game chat messages, you will now be able to report player skins and usernames that violate our Community Standards in Java Edition.

Just like with chat reports, nothing is automated. Any reported skin or username will be reviewed manually by a team of trained Minecraft moderators, who will use the submitted evidence to decide whether the skin and/or username is in breach of our Community Standards. Skins that are in violation of these standards will be removed from Minecraft and will no longer be accessible for use by any player. Usernames that are in violation of these standards will need to be changed before that player can play online via a shared server or Realm; though single player mode will still be accessible. To find out more about this and other safety policies, including more detail on the suspension procedure, appeals process, and how we handle malicious or repeat reporting, please visit our dedicated FAQ page.

## New Features

### Player Skin & Name Reporting

-   Player Skins and Names can now be reported in the Social Interactions Screen
-   If a skin or name is reported, and found to be violating the [Community Standards](https://www.minecraft.net/community-standards), our team of human moderators can action in a few ways:
    -   Ban the skin from being used by any player
    -   Ban the name from being used by any player
    -   Suspend the player from online play in the case of repeated offences
-   When a skin is banned, players with that skin:
    -   Will have their skin removed
    -   Will be notified when they launch the game
    -   Will be automatically assigned one of the default skins
    -   Can still play multiplayer and singleplayer
    -   Can select a new custom skin at any time
-   When a player's name is banned, that player:
    -   Will need to choose a new name
    -   Will be notified when they launch the game
    -   Will not be able to play online until they change their name
    -   Can still play singleplayer
-   A skin or name that has been banned cannot be used by any player in the future

## Changes

-   Sponges and Wet Sponges now have their own custom sounds
-   The calculations to determine whether a mob can attack a player or other mobs have been changed
-   Added the "Narrator Hotkey" accessibility option
    -   Allows the narrator to be toggled on and off with `Ctrl+B`
-   Added "I want to report them" Player Reporting category
-   A change has been reverted where armor trim patterns would be masked by the underlying armor texture

### Mob attack reach changes

The calculations to determine whether a mob can attack a player or other mobs have been changed. Previously a mob's horizontal width was used to determine their attack reach and their height had no effect. The area where a mob can attack is now their bounding box extended in horizontal directions.

Here are some situations where the new rules will affect the reach of mobs:

-   If a mob is entirely below you, or entirely above you, it will not be able to reach you
-   While riding on a medium-sized mob, like a Horse, you will be protected from small mobs, like Baby Zombies
-   While riding on a tall mob, like a Camel, you will be protected from standard-size mobs, like Zombies
-   Also, Ravagers won't be able to attack you through a few block thick walls anymore
-   However, to escape from an Enderman, you need to be at least 3 blocks above the ground, not 1.5 as before
-   Mobs will be able to attack you with the bottom of their hitbox, assuming your head is in range
-   Builds that trap hostile mobs might need to be adjusted to be safe

This change does not affect the reach of players, and mobs still need to see their target to attack it. We believe this new system will be more intuitive and will result in a more consistent behavior, and we welcome all feedback on this change.

## Technical Changes

-   The charts on the debug screen can now be toggled with F3+1 (pie chart), F3+2 (FPS and TPS) and F3+3 (bandwidth and ping) instead of holding Shift, Alt or Ctrl while opening the screen

### Data Pack Changes

-   Added `decal` field to armor trim patterns (default: `false`)
    -   If `true`, the pattern texture will be masked based on the underlying armor

## Fixed bugs in 23w33a

-   [MC-2310](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-2310) Wrong attack radius calculation damages/kills entities through blocks and corners

-   `HiddenEffect` -> `hidden_effect`, also since it's mob effect instance, changes apply recursively
-   `FactorCalculationData` -> `factor_calculation_data`

**Items**

**`potion`, `lingering_potion`, `splash_potion`, `tipped_arrow`**

-   `CustomPotionEffects` -> `custom_potion_effects`, contents tranformed as a list of mob effect instances

**`suspicous_stew`**

-   `Effects` -> `effects`, for each entry:
    -   `EffectId` -> `id`, also changed from number to string id
    -   `EffectDuration` -> `duration`

**Entities**

**`mooshroom`**

-   Removed `EffectId` and `EffectDuration`
-   Added `stew_effects` with the same format as `suspicious_stew.effects` tag (i.e. list of effect id and duration)

**`area_effect_cloud`**

-   `Effects` -> `effects`, contents tranformed as a list of mob effect instances

**`arrow`**

-   `CustomPotionEffects` -> `custom_potion_effects`, contents tranformed as a list of mob effect instances

**Players, Armor Stands and mobs**

-   `ActiveEffects` -> `active_effects`, contents tranformed as a list of mob effect instances

**Block Entities**

**`beacon`**

-   `Primary` -> `primary_effect`, also changed from number to string id
-   `Secondary` -> `secondary_effect`, also changed from number to string id

**Loot Tables**

-   Added `sequence` loot function
    -   Contains 1 field:
        -   `functions`: an array of sub-functions to run in sequence
    -   Can also be declared as an inline array with out a type
        -   This matches the existing behavior where loot function JSON files can be declared as an array of composite functions
-   `all_of` predicates in loot tables can now be declared implicitly as an inline array without a type
    -   This similarly matches the existing behavior where loot predicate JSON files can be declared as an array of sub-predicates

### Network optimizations

-   Gameplay packets are now packed into bigger TCP-packets to reduce overhead from TCP-headers, significantly reducing network usage
-   Opening the debug screen with CTRL + F3 will now show charts for ping and received network traffic

### Secure Chat

-   Clients will no longer disconnect themselves when receiving an invalid chat message
    -   A placeholder message will instead be shown in chat
