# Minecraft Snapshot 24w40a

Hello!

In this week's snapshot we are adding a new experiment which will allow you to experience the Pale Garden, a new eerie biome filled with Pale Oak Trees and Hanging Moss. Beware of its sole inhabitant, the Creaking, and don't blink!

Happy Exploring!

## Experimental Features

The experimental feature with the Pale Garden biome can be enabled by turning the "Winter Drop" experiment on. You can do this in the Experiments screen while creating the world. These experiments have no effect unless enabled. You can find more information about Feature Toggles [here](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/testing-new-minecraft-features/feature-toggles-java-edition).

We would love to hear your feedback on the new Pale Garden biome and the hostile mob the Creaking.

#### Pale Hanging Moss

Pale Hanging Moss generates naturally in the Pale Garden biome under the foliage of Pale Oaks

-   Pale Hanging Moss does not grow randomly, but can be bonemealed to grow down

#### Creaking mob

The Creaking mob spawns at night in the Pale Garden biome if there is a Creaking Heart block that has been generated in a Pale Oak tree. Gameplay features:

#### Creaking Heart

A Creaking Heart is a “living” block generating in Pale Oak trees, covered on all sides by Pale Oak wood logs. It can spawn a Creaking mob when it is nighttime, and it is placed between two correctly aligned Pale Oak log blocks.

-   Is active during night and dormant during day
-   Sends a trail of particles towards the connected Creaking when the Creaking gets hit by the player
-   When Creaking Heart block is destroyed, the connected Creaking is removed

#### New system for Pale Garden ambient sounds

Ambient sounds in the Pale Garden biome do not come from the biome settings but are generated by blocks found in the biome

Hi everyone! In this snapshot we have fixed the bug with Ender Pearls not teleporting the player to the point of impact. Ender Pearls will now also load chunks when thrown. Happy mining!

## New Features

## Changes

-   Thrown Ender Pearls now load and tick chunks
-   Added language support for High Norwegian

### Ender Pearl Chunk Loading

-   Ender Pearls now ensure that the chunk they are in or travel into is always loaded and ticking
-   They also load chunks when crossing to a new dimension, so that they can always continue to travel
-   This ensures that Ender Pearls can always land, and makes cross dimensional Ender Pearl travelling more predictable
-   Ender Pearls now unload when a player logs out, and reappear whenever that player logs back in, similar to how mounts currently behave

### Mob Conversion Details

In last week's snapshot, we fixed a bug related to which data gets transferred between mobs when converted from one type to another (ex: zombie to drowned). This week, we have reverted a few of those changes (health, attributes, and loot tables are no longer transferred).

    -   `Rotation`
    -   `Silent`
    -   `SleepingX`
    -   `SleepingY`
    -   `SleepingZ`
    -   `Tags`
    -   `Team`
-   Mobs that split into several mobs rather than converting from one type into another do not transfer the following properties:
    
    -   `ArmorDropChances`
    -   `ArmorItems`
    -   `fall_distance`
    -   `FallFlying`
    -   `HandDropChances`

#### `minecraft:fire_resistant` -> `minecraft:damage_resistant`

-   Has a new field: `types`, hash-prefixed damage type tag
    -   Items with this component, when in entity form, will be resistant to the damage types included in the tag
    -   This component also affects whether the equipped item will be damaged when the wearer is hurt by a given damage type

#### `minecraft:item_name`

-   Name provided by this component always has the lowest priority
    -   That means it will be overriden by components like `minecraft:potion_contents`

#### `minecraft:potion_contents`

-   Added optional string field `custom_name`
    -   When present, it will be used to generate containing stack name
    -   For example, if value is `foo` and item is `minecraft:lingering_potion`, the name of item will be translation of `item.minecraft.lingering_potion.effect.foo`

#### `minecraft:equippable`

-   Added the following fields
    -   `swappable`: boolean (default: `true`), whether the item can be equipped into the relevant slot by right-clicking
    -   `damage_on_hurt`: boolean (default: `true`), whether this item will be damaged when the wearing entity is damaged

#### Added `minecraft:death_protection`

-   If present, this item will protect the holder from dying by restoring a single health point
-   Format: object with fields
    -   `death_effects`: An optional list of effects that are applied when the item protects the holder
        -   These effects are the same as those specified by the `on_consume_effects` field in the `consumable` component

### Predicates

#### `salmon` entity sub-predicate

-   Added `minecraft:salmon` entity sub-predicate
-   Fields:
    -   `variant`: one of `small`, `medium`, `large`

### Advancements

#### Triggers

##### `minecraft:killed_by_crossbow` -> `minecraft:killed_by_arrow`

-   Will now trigger whenever an Arrow kills an entity, not just when fired from a Crossbow
-   Has a new optional Item Predicate field, `fired_from_weapon`
    -   Can be used to match the item used to shoot the arrow

## Resource Pack Version 38

### GUI Sprites

-   The appearance of a highlighted slot may now be customized by replacing sprites:
    -   `container/slot_highlight_front`: The sprite to render in front of highlighted slots
    -   `container/slot_highlight_back`: The sprite to render behind highlighted slots
-   Likewise, the appearance of a highlighted item within the Bundle can be customized with the following sprites:
    -   `container/bundle/slot_highlight_front`
    -   `container/bundle/slot_highlight_back`
