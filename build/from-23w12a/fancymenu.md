# Minecraft Snapshot 23w12a

Well hello fellow Minecraft lovers! It is time for the first snapshot for 1.20. We know we promised no more major features, so how did we end up with such a big snapshot? You thought the trails were over? NO! In snapshot 23w12a we have even more tales to tell! Our devs apparently could not resist throwing in a few extra additions. Enjoy!

## New Features

-   All features and changes from the "Update 1.20" experimental pack are now part of the game
-   Vibration resonance functionality has been added to Blocks of Amethyst
-   Added the Calibrated Sculk Sensor block
-   Added Suspicious Gravel, more Archaeology sites, and new Pottery Shards
-   Added 5 new armor trims
-   Signs have improved customization options
-   Added Sniffer Egg
-   Added Pitcher Plant

### Vibration Resonance

-   Blocks of Amethyst have a new behavior when placed adjacent to Sculk Sensors
    -   If that Sculk Sensor receives a vibration, the Block of Amethyst will re-emit its frequency as a separate vibration at its location
-   This behaviour is called Vibration Resonance, and allows players to move vibration frequencies across long distances without having to recreate the vibration naturally

### Calibrated Sculk Sensors

-   A new variant of Sculk Sensors which allows you to filter vibrations based on their frequency level
-   They are not found naturally and can only be crafted with 1 Sculk Sensor and 3 Amethyst Shards in the Crafting Table
-   One side of the Calibrated Sculk Sensor can receive a redstone signal as input
    -   The strength of that redstone signal is the only vibration frequency the Sculk Sensor will listen to

### Archaeology

-   Added Suspicious Gravel block
    -   It has the same characteristics as Suspicious Sand
-   Added Suspicious Gravel to Cold Ocean Ruins
-   Added Suspicious Sand to Warm Ocean Ruins
    -   Sniffer Eggs can be found here
-   Added the Trail Ruins, a buried structure from a lost culture
    -   Four Armor trims can be found here
-   Added 16 Pottery Shards (so there are now 20 Pottery Shards in total)
    -   These have been distributed between the 5 Archaeology sites: Desert Wells, Desert Temples, Cold Ocean Ruins, Warm Ocean Ruins, and Trail Ruins

### Armor Trims

New armor trim Smithing Templates have been added to the following structures:

-   Trail Ruins
    -   Wayfinder Armor Trim
    -   Raiser Armor Trim
    -   Shaper Armor Trim
    -   Host Armor Trim
-   Ancient City
    -   Silence Armor Trim

### Signs

-   Sign text can now be edited after being placed in the world
    -   This can be done by interacting with the Sign
-   Both sides of the Sign can now have separate text and colors, allowing for further customization options
    -   By default, a Sign will prompt you to input the front side's text when placed
    -   To apply text to the back-side, you must walk to the other side and interact with that face to edit it
-   Signs can now also be waxed with Honeycomb, preventing any further edits to its text
    -   Click commands on Signs can only be invoked when the Sign is waxed
    -   If a Sign with a click command is not waxed, interacting with it will not invoke the command and instead open up the edit screen as usual

### Sniffer Egg

-   Can be found in the Suspicious Sand of Warm Ocean Ruins
-   When two Sniffers breed they do not immediately spawn a Snifflet; instead, a Sniffer Egg is dropped
-   Hatching
    -   When placed on Moss, the Egg will hatch after approximately 10 minutes
    -   On all other blocks, it will hatch in approximately 20 minutes

### Pitcher Plant

-   The Sniffer can now occasionally Sniff up a Pitcher Pod item
    -   This Pod, when planted in Farmland, grows into a Pitcher Crop, which has five growth stages
    -   Once fully grown, the Pitcher Crop can be harvested, yielding a two-block-tall Pitcher Plant

## Changes

-   Vibration frequencies of many actions in the game have been tweaked
-   Wither effect particle color has been adjusted to make it more distinguishable
-   Potion of Slow Falling color has been adjusted to make it more distinguishable
-   Step sounds can now combine for blocks walked through and stepped on

### Vibration Frequencies

In preparation for the Calibrated Sculk Sensor, vibration frequencies have been greatly simplified to prevent unwanted interference. The following are category descriptions for each frequency and the expected events that they correspond to:

1.  Movement in any medium (land, water and air)
2.  Landing on any surface (land or water)
3.  Item interactions
4.  Gliding with an elytra or unique mob actions (Ravager roar, Wolf shaking, etc)
5.  Dismounting a mob or equipping gear
6.  Mounting a mob or interacting with a mob
7.  Mobs and players getting damaged
8.  Consuming items (drinking and eating)
9.  Blocks 'deactivating' (door close, chest close, button unpress, etc)
10.  Blocks 'activating' (door open, chest open, button press, etc)
11.  Blocks changing (cauldron water level rising, adding food to campfire, etc)
12.  Blocks being destroyed
13.  Blocks being placed
14.  Mobs and players teleporting or spawning
15.  Mobs and players dying or an explosion

### Combination Step Sounds

-   Combines two different step sounds
-   Occurs for carpets, snow, nether sprouts, as well as warped and crimson roots
    -   The top-most block you are walking on is played as normal
    -   The block underneath is played at a lower volume and pitch

### Armor Trims

-   The Dune Armor Trim now has a brand-new pattern and Smithing Template icon
-   The Dune Armor Trim's old pattern is now used by the Sentry Armor Trim
    -   A new icon has been made for the Sentry Armor Trim Smithing Template to fit this pattern
-   The Sentry Armor Trim's old pattern is now used by the new Shaper Armor Trim

## Technical Changes

-   The data pack version is now 13, accounting for sign data format changes
-   Added a `capped` rule structure processor that limits the number of replaced blocks for a structure piece to a configured maximum
-   Configuring block entity fields in a `rule` processor rule is now delegated to a referenced `block_entity_modifier` instead of the previously fixed `output_nbt` configuration
-   Game events have changed vibration frequency and some have been removed
-   Tweaked display entity interpolation
-   Removed `update_1_20` feature flag and built-in datapack - features are no longer experimental

### Structure post-processors

#### Capped post-processor

-   A `capped` post-processor has been added which can limit how many blocks a delegated post-processor randomly transform in a structure
-   This can be used to configure a structure piece to have an exact amount of specific blocks, instead of using random distribution
-   The `capped` post-processor has following required parameters:
    -   `delegate` A post-processor which performs the actual block transformation
    -   `limit` Maximum amount of blocks that the delegated post-processor can transform
        -   The blocks inside a structure are all randomly passed to the delegated post-processor until it has transformed the limited amount
        -   Either constant or random number generator sampled during post-processing

#### Rule post-processor block entity configuration

-   Previously a rule could specify an optional fixed `output_nbt` which would be added to the processed output block entity
-   This field has now been changed to reference a `block_entity_modifier`
-   Existing `block_entity_modifier`'s are:
    -   `passthrough` Retains existing fields on the block entity
        -   This is the default if no `block_entity_modifier` is specified
    -   `append_static` Similar to previous `output_nbt` this provides fixed fields to add to the block entity
        -   A minor change is that this modifier appends configured fields to the processed block instead of replacing existing fields
    -   `clear` Removes any existing fields on the block entity
    -   `append_loot` Appends a loot table and seed to the block entity through required parameter:
        -   `loot_table` Referenced loot table to add to block entity as `LootTable` field
        -   Field `LootTableSeed` is also added to the block entity using random seeded by block position

### Game Events

-   `piston_contract` game event has been removed in favor of `block_deactivate`
-   `piston_extend` and `dispense_fail` game events have been removed in favor of `block_activate`
-   Many game events have new vibration frequencies:
    -   1: `step`, `swim`, `flap`
    -   2: `projectile_land`, `hit_ground`, `splash`
    -   3: `item_interact_finish`, `projectile_shoot`, `instrument_play`
    -   4: `entity_roar`, `entity_shake`, `elytra_glide`
    -   5: `entity_dismount`, `equip`
    -   6: `entity_mount`, `entity_interact`, `shear`
    -   7: `entity_damage`
    -   8: `drink`, `eat`
    -   9: `container_close`, `block_close`, `block_deactivate`, `block_detach`
    -   10: `container_open`, `block_open`, `block_activate`, `block_attach`, `prime_fuse`, `note_block_play`
    -   11: `block_change`
    -   12: `block_destroy`, `fluid_pickup`
    -   13: `block_place`, `fluid_place`
    -   14: `entity_place`, `lightning_strike`, `teleport`
    -   15: `entity_die`, `explode`

### Tags

#### Step Sounds

-   The blocks that can produce a combination of step sounds is controlled by `combination_step_sound_blocks`

### Display entity

#### Interpolation changes

-   Previous values are always discarded if `interpolation_duration` is `0`
-   Made sure that render properties are applied at the same time (so `block_state` is applied at the same time as transformation, i.e. at next tick after receiving update)
-   Entities are not rendered unless initial data is received. That means display entities might not show on the first tick.
-   Note: due to how game handles updates, changes to entities made after summoning might be delivered to clients with later tick

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w07a

This week we're bringing you the Sniffer, Archaeology, and the Cherry Blossom biome as experimental features for the 1.20 update.

Changes for the 1.19.4 release include Interaction Entities, and updates to jukeboxes and horse breeding.

Happy brushing!

## Changes

-   Jukeboxes have changed to be at parity with Bedrock
-   Horse breeding has been updated
-   Updated the Realms screen to be more in line with the Singleplayer and Multiplayer screens

### Recipe unlocking

-   The Crafting Table recipe is unlocked immediately on creating a new world
-   The Crossbow recipe is no longer unlocked by sticks
-   The Soul Campfire recipe is no longer unlocked by sticks

### Jukebox

-   While playing a music disc, it will emit a redstone signal of 15
-   Droppers and hoppers can now interact with it

### Horses

-   When breeding horses and the like, the babies' speed, jump height and health are no longer biased toward the average
-   This change is intended to make horse breeding a viable way of getting great horses, if a player starts with good parents and puts in enough time and Golden Carrots

## Technical Changes

-   The vanilla resource pack en;;_;;us language file is now sorted alphanumerically by key
-   A new recipe serializer `crafting_decorated_pot` has been added for the new Decorated Pot recipe
-   Added `show_notification` field to recipes
    -   Accepts a boolean which determines if a notification is shown when unlocking this recipe
    -   defaults to `true` if isn't specified

### Interaction Entities

A new type of entity that records attacks ("left clicks") and interactions ("right clicks"). Interactions are invisible and of a custom size.

Fields:

-   `width`: Width of the entity's bounding box (default `1`)
-   `height`: Height of the entity's bounding box (default `1`)
-   `attack`: Records the last attack action on the entity
-   `interaction`: Records the last interaction action on the entity
-   `response`: Boolean specifying if interacting should trigger a response (arm swing, sound effects, etc - default `false`)

#### Action Format

When an action is stored, it always has two fields:

-   `player`: The UUID (in standard integer array format) of the player performing the action
-   `timestamp`: The timestamp of the game tick when the event happened (stored as a long)

#### Advancement Triggers

-   Interacting with an Interaction entity triggers `player_interacted_with_entity`
-   Attacking an Interaction entity triggers `player_hurt_entity`

#### `execute on` with Interactions

The Interaction entity targets the player who last interacted with it. That makes the following possible:

-   `execute on attacker`: execute as the last player who attacked the entity
-   `execute on target`: execute as the last player who interacted with the entity

## Experimental Features

-   Added Sniffer mob
-   Added a Cherry Grove biome
-   Added Archaeology

### Sniffer

-   Sniffer Mob now available as an experimental feature
    -   The Sniffer is the mob vote winner of Minecraft Live 2022 and the first "ancient" mob added to the game
    -   Sniffers cannot be tempted or tamed
    -   Sniffers are passive friendly mobs
    -   Sniffers sniff in the air and occasionally dig for seeds
-   Torchflower now available as an experimental feature
    -   The Torchflower seed can be planted on farmland and grows into a flower
    -   The seed can be used to breed two Sniffers
    -   The full-grown flower can be harvested and replanted but can also be crafted into a dye

### Cherry Grove biome

-   Added a new Cherry Grove biome, with pretty cherry blossom trees
-   You can find it in the mountains, like Meadows

#### Pink Petals block

-   Added a new Pink Petals block with lots of pink flowers on the ground

#### Cherry Wood Set

-   Added a new Cherry wood set, with all the corresponding wooden things you can make from it. You need to have the Update 1.20 experimental features enabled to see it in game.

### Archaeology

#### The brush

-   The brush is a craftable item you can use to brush things

#### Suspicious Sand

-   Desert Temples and Desert Wells now contain Suspicious Sand. This fragile block is hard to spot and easy to destroy, so be careful!
-   Brushing the Suspicious Sand with a Brush will extract objects that were buried long ago

#### Pottery Shards

-   Pottery Shards have pictures on them
-   They cannot be crafted and are only found by brushing Suspicious Sand

#### Decorated Pots

-   Crafting four Pottery Shards together will create a Decorated Pot with a picture on each side
-   You can also use Brick items instead of Pottery Shards in the Decorated Pot recipe
    -   The sides that were made from Brick items will not have pictures
-   Smash a Decorated Pot with any block-breaking tool to break it apart and get the Pottery Shards back
    -   Or hit it with your fist to pick up the pot without breaking it

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w06a

Today we are bringing you the `damage` command and new display entities.

Damage safely!

## Changes

-   Jukeboxes now emit a note particle above them while playing a music disc to match Bedrock

### Accessibility

-   Added a new option in the Accessibility menu called Damage Tilt for controlling the amount of camera shake when being hurt
-   Added a tooltip in the Key Binds screen that specifies which keybinds are conflicting
-   "Notification Display Time" accessibility option was renamed to "Notification Time"

### Updated Create New World Screen

-   Tabs can be switched with the keyboard by pressing Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab
-   Specific tabs can also be navigated to by pressing Ctrl+Tab Number
    -   For example, Ctrl+2 navigates to the second tab
-   Added a screen to easily enable/disable experimental features
    -   The screen can always be found under the More-tab
    -   In snapshots a shortcut button can be found under the Game-tab

### Creative menu

-   Added painting variants to creative menu
-   Paintings with pre-defined variant will now display author and title in description when hovered over

## Technical Changes

-   Added display entities for flexible display of items, blocks and text
-   Added a `damage` command for applying damage to entities
-   Added `--pidFile` argument to dedicated server command line for printing process id to file
-   Added the following game events:
    -   `entity_dismount` with a vibration frequency of 6
    -   `entity_mount` with a vibration frequency of 7
-   Added a group of entities to display items, blocks and text
-   Added `execute summon` to allow customization of a newly spawned entity

### Display entities

Three new entities have been added for flexible display of items, blocks and text

-   Those entities, similarily to `marker`, don't tick and have no collisions or physics
-   Models render at entity position, with normal rotation around X and Y axis (so it can be controlled by teleport commands), but also with additional arbitrary model transform

#### Common data types

Tag contents for those entities include some new data types with complex structure. Any form can be used for modifying data, but only one form is used for saving.

##### `rotation`

-   Quaternion form (used for saving): array of 4 numbers, describing components (x, y, z, w)
-   Axis-angle form: object with following fields:
    -   `axis` - 3d vector
    -   `angle` - in radians

#### `transformation`

Arbitrary affine transform

-   Matrix form: array of 16 numbers, describing row-major matrix
-   Decomposed form (used for saving): object with following fields:
    -   `translation` - 3d vector
    -   `left_rotation`, `right_rotation` - `rotation`
    -   `scale` - 3d vector
    -   Transforms are composed in order `translation`, `left_rotation`, `scale`, `right_rotation`

#### Interpolation

Some properties of display entites can be interpolated. That means that clients will see gradual changes over time instead of instantenous jumps.

Display entities keep track of current and previous values of interpolated values:

-   All properties marked as "interpolated" are part of a single interpolation set
-   Any update to interpolated property will cause all values of interpolation set to be saved as "current"
    -   Data command executions that do not change value of property (even if it's present in NBT) do not count as updates
    -   Updates are synchronized to clients at most once per tick, so multiple updates within command will still count as single update
-   Previous current values are saved as "previous"
-   If interpolation is enabled, entity will transition between "previous" and "current" values over time
-   Start of interpolation (entity fully in "previous" state) is defined by field `interpolation_start` (game time, in ticks)
    -   Set to `-1` to load current game time instead)
-   End of interpolation (entity fully in "current" state) is defined as `interpolation_start` + `interpolation_duration` (in ticks)

#### Common properties

Every entity in family has the following fields:

-   `transformation` - `transformation` applied to model (after normal entity orientation). Defaults to identity. Interpolated
-   `billboard` - option to control if entity should pivot to face player when rendered:
    -   `fixed` - no rotation (default)
    -   `vertical` - entity can pivot around vertical axis
    -   `horizontal` - entity can pivot around horizontal axis
    -   `center` - entity can pivot around center point
-   `brightness` - if present, overrides light values used for rendering. Omited by default (which means rendering uses values from entity position). Object has two fields:
    -   `sky` - value of skylight, 0..15
    -   `block` - value of block light, 0..15
-   `view_range` - maximum view range of this entity. Actual distance depends on client-side render distance and entity distance scalling. Default value 1.0 (roughly the same as fireball)
-   `shadow_radius` - size of shadow. Defaults to 0 (no shadow). Interpolated
-   `shadow_strength` - strength of the shadow. Controls the opacity of the shadow as a function of distance to block below. Defaults to 1. Interpolated
-   `width`, `height` - describe size of culling bounding box. Bounding box spans vertically `y` to `y+height` and horizontally `width/2` in all directions from entity position. If either field is set to 0, culling is disabled. Both default to 0
-   `glow_color_override` - override glow border color. Defaults to 0 (use team color)

#### `item_display`

Displays a single item stack.

-   Stack can be changed with commands by setting slot `inventory.0`

Fields:

-   `item` - item stack to display. Same format as in inventory (example: `{id: "minecraft:dirt", Count: 1}`)
-   `item_display` - describes item model transform applied to item (as defined in `display` section in model JSON)
    -   Values: `none` (default), `thirdperson_lefthand`, `thirdperson_righthand`, `firstperson_lefthand`, `firstperson_righthand`, `head`, `gui`, `ground`, `fixed`

#### `block_display`

Displays a block state.

-   Does not display block entities, even if they would normally be created on block placement (like chest)

Fields:

-   `block_state` - block state to display. Same format as item held by endermen (example `{Name:"minecraft:dirt"}`)

#### `text_display`

Displays a text component.

Fields:

-   `text` - text to display. Components are resolved with the context of the display entity
-   `line_width` - line width used to split lines (note: new line can be also addded with `;;n;;` characters). Defaults to 200
-   `text_opacity` - opacity (alpha component) of rendered text. Defaults to 255. Interpolated
-   `background` - color of background. Includes alpha channel. Defaults to 0x40000000. Interpolated
-   `default_background` - if true, rendering uses default text background color (same as in chat). Defaults to false
-   `shadow` - should text be displayed with shadow. Defaults to false
-   `see_through` - should text be visible through blocks. Defaults to false
-   `alignment` - how text should be aligned
    -   Values: `center` (default), `left`, `right`

Note: text display backgrounds uses new shader types `rendertype_text_background` and `rendertype_text_background_see_through`

### Damage Types

Damage Types are a new registry that can be extended through data packs. A Damage Type determines how damage is handled by the game. This includes which attributes the damage has as well as which death message is used when an entity dies due to that type of damage.

Example:

    {
      "exhaustion": 0.1,
      "message_id": "arrow",
      "scaling": "when_caused_by_living_non_player"
    }
    

Fields:

-   `message_id`: The message id used for deaths caused by this damage type
    -   Will be combined with other string fragments to form a translation key
-   `exhaustion`: The amount of hunger exhaustion caused by this damage type
-   `scaling`: Whether this damage type scales with difficulty levels. Possible values:
    -   `never`: Damage is always the same
    -   `always`: Damage always scales with difficulty
    -   `when_caused_by_living_non_player`: Damage scales with difficulty if it was caused by a living entity who is not a player
-   `effects`: Optional field controlling how damage manifests when inflicted on players. Possible values:
    -   `hurt` (default): the default hurt sound
    -   `thorns`: Thorns hurt sound
    -   `drowning`: Drowning sound
    -   `burning`: A single tick of burning sound
    -   `poking`: Berry bush poke sound
    -   `freezing`: Freeze tick sound
-   `death_message_type`: Optional field that controls if special death message variants are used. Possible values:
    -   `default` (default): No special death message logic is applied
    -   `fall_variants`: Show a variant of fall damage death instead of a regular death message, e.g. `death.fell.assist.item`
    -   `intentional_game_design`: Show the intentional game design message instead of a regular death message

Damage type tags control many aspects of how damage from different sources are interpreted.

### Commands

#### `damage`

New command to apply damage to entities.

Syntax:

-   `damage <target> <amount> [<damageType>] [at <location>]`
-   `damage <target> <amount> [<damageType>] [by <entity>] [from <cause>]`

Parameters:

-   `target`: The entity to damage
-   `amount`: Amount of damage to inflict
-   `damageType`: The type of damage to inflict
    -   This determines how the damage affects the entity as well as which death message is displayed
-   `entity`: The entity inflicting the damage
-   `cause`: The cause of the damage, in the case of indirect damage
    -   Example: When shot by an arrow, the `entity` is the Arrow projectile while `cause` might be a Skeleton
-   `location`: The location the damage originated at (when no entity caused the damage)
    -   For instance, `location` might represent the location of a Bed exploding in the Nether

#### `execute summon`

New `execute` sub-command for summoning new entity and binding context (`@s`) to it. Meant to simplify entity setup and reduce need for raw NBT editing.

-   `execute summon <entity id>`

### Predicates

#### Damage Type Predicates

The following fields have been removed from damage type predicates: `is_projectile`, `is_explosion`, `bypasses_armor`, `bypasses_invulnerability`, `bypasses_magic`, `is_fire`, `is_magic`, `is_lightning`.

A new `tags` array has been added. Each entry has two fields:

-   `id`: The ID of a damage type tag
-   `expected`: Whether the damage is expected to have or not have the tag for the predicate to match

### Game Rules

-   Added `doVinesSpread` game rule, determining if vines will spread to nearby blocks
    -   Defaults to `true`
