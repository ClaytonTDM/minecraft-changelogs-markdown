# Minecraft Snapshot 24w03a

New year, new Snapshot - we're now releasing the third Snapshot of Minecraft 1.20.5. This time around, we're bringing some updates to the Armadillo, the Breeze, as well as accessibility improvements.

In addition to a big bundle of bug fixes, we're bringing some changes to how spawn chunks are handled.

The spawn chunks are an area of the Overworld located at the world spawn which are always loaded in memory. These are useful for some players but use more of your computer’s resources and make the game load and run more slowly. (You can read more about spawn chunks at the [community wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Spawn_chunk)!)

In this snapshot we made the size of the spawn chunks configurable by adding a new gamerule: `spawnChunkRadius`. The new default setting is 2 (which creates a 48x48 block area). This is 98% smaller than the previous area and will result in a noticeable performance improvement for most players.

If you would like to keep your spawn chunks working like they did before, you can use the game rule to change the spawn chunk radius value to 10. This will make your spawn chunks work the same as they did before, but you will miss out on the performance gains.

We're interested in hearing your feedback on this change and how the new default setting affects you.

[Let's talk about spawn chunks!](https://aka.ms/spawnchunksfeedback)

## New Features

### Armadillo

Armadillo visual update! We gathered feedback from the first Armadillo snapshot, and the next step in the look of the Armadillo, the Armadillo Scutes and the Wolf Armor are now here.

-   Armadillos now also spawn in Badlands

#### Armadillo Rolling Up Behavior

-   Spiders and Cave Spiders will run away from Armadillos not in a rolled up state

## Changes

-   Adjusted the texture of the Wolf Collar layer to be more consistent with the new Wolf Armor

### Accessibility

-   The default focus is now always set when entering or exiting any menu while navigating using tab or arrow keys

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 28
-   The Resource Pack version is now 24
-   Custom Villager trades can be configured to accept items that have different tags from the expected item by adding `ignoreTags: true` in the trade's NBT
-   When entities leave or enter the end the area they arrive in will now stay loaded for 15 seconds, matching the behavior of nether portals
-   Added transfer packets
-   Added cookie packets
-   Decreased the default size of the spawn chunks and made the value configurable

### Transfer Packets

-   Custom servers can now request that clients connect to another server with a new packet
-   When a client is transferred it will connect to the target server with a new transfer intent (id 3)
-   By default servers will not accept incoming transfers and will disconnect the client
-   This can be changed by setting the `accepts-transfers` property to `true` in the `server.properties` file
-   Resource packs are maintained across transfers
-   In the case of a transfer custom servers can skip authentication with a new flag

### Cookie Packets

-   Cookie packets allow custom servers to request and store data on a client
    -   Each cookie may be up to 5 KiB in size
    -   Cookies may be requested during login, configuration and play phases — but only stored during the configuration and play phases
-   Cookies are persisted across server transfers but are not persisted when the player disconnects
    -   This allows servers to pass along information such as authentication or custom game data to the new server

### Spawn Chunk Changes

-   The size of the spawn chunks changed from radius 10 (19x19 entity ticking chunks) to radius 2 (3x3 entity ticking chunks)
    -   This was done to reduce memory usage, loading times and CPU usage
    -   We opted to not fully remove spawn chunks to allow players who currently utilize this functionality to continue to do so
-   Added a new gamerule `spawnChunkRadius` to set the size of the spawn chunks
    -   Possible values are 0 to 32, where 0 completely disables the spawn chunks and 10 is equivalent to the functionality before this change
    -   Default value is 2, equivalent to 3x3 entity ticking chunks

## Data Pack Version 28

-   The `minecraft:sweeping` enchantment has been renamed to `minecraft:sweeping_edge`
-   Added Advancement Criteria trigger `default_block_use` which triggers due to the default interaction of a block by a player, such as opening a door
-   Added Advancement Criteria trigger `any_block_use` which triggers due to any type of interaction with a block by a player, such as using an item on the block or its default usage

### Tags

#### Item Tags

New item tags controlling what enchantments can be added to what gear:

-   `minecraft:enchantable/foot_armor`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/leg_armor`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/chest_armor`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/head_armor`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/armor`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/weapon`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/sword`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/mining`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/mining_loot`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/fishing`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/trident`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/durability`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/bow`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/equippable`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/crossbow`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/vanishing`

#### Entity Type Tags:

-   Added `minecraft:ignores_poison_and_regen` for entities that cannot be affected by Poison and Regeneration effects
-   Added `minecraft:illager_friends` for entities that Illagers will consider allies (unless on a different team)
-   Added `minecraft:inverted_healing_and_harm` for entities that have inverted meanings of the Healing and Harm effects
-   Added `minecraft:not_scary_for_pufferfish` for entities that will not cause Pufferfish to puff
-   Added `minecraft:sensitive_to_bane_of_arthropods` for entities sensitive to Bane of Arthropods
-   Added `minecraft:sensitive_to_impaling` for entities sensitive to Impaling
-   Added `minecraft:wither_friends` for entities that the Wither will not target and which cannot harm the Wither

## Resource Pack 24

-   The `ttf` font provider transforms have been adjusted to have more reasonable defaults
    -   `shift` is no longer applied double, and now directly represents a number of pixels in the game UI
    -   The font EM square is fitted to `size` pixels in the game UI, instead of between the font ascender and font descender
    -   The font baseline is positioned consistently with the default font (7 pixels below line top)
    -   This means that generally, any font with a `size` of 9 and no `shift` should look correct by default

## Experimental Features

### Breeze

-   Breeze now deflects all projectiles
-   Deflected projectiles now deflect in the direction of the shooter

### Trade Rebalance

-   In the Trade Rebalance Experiment, Villagers who buy armor now ignore durability and can buy damaged armor

We're now releasing Snapshot 23w51a, the first snapshot for Minecraft 1.20.5. This one comes with a present for your pet Wolf in time for the holidays - and the Armadillo.

Happy brushing!

## New Features

-   Added Armadillo, Armadillo Scutes and Wolf Armor

### Armadillo

-   The Armadillo is a new passive mob that:
    -   drops Armadillo Scutes periodically
    -   drops Armadillo Scutes when brushed
    -   spawns in Savannas
    -   its favorite food is Spider Eye

#### Armadillo Rolling Up Behavior

-   Armadillo rolls up when it detects a threat such as:
    -   a sprinting player
    -   a player in a vehicle or mounted
    -   undead mobs
-   It does not roll up when:
    -   it is fleeing
    -   in water
    -   in the air or
    -   on a leash
-   When an Armadillo is rolled up it does not walk, cannot eat, and will not be tempted by food
    -   It will continue to scan for threats: if none are detected for 3 seconds, it will unroll

#### Armadillo Scutes

-   Armadillo Scutes can be used to craft Wolf Armor
-   They are dropped by Armadillos
-   Dispensers can be used to brush Armadillo Scutes off Armadillos

### Wolf Armor

-   Using Wolf Armor on an adult tamed Wolf will equip the armor on the wolf.
-   Only a Wolf's owner can put a Wolf Armor on their tamed Wolf, and with this in mind; Dispensers cannot put Wolf Armor on wolves.
-   Wolf Armor gives the same protection as Diamond Horse Armor.
-   Using Shears on a Wolf that is wearing armor will make it drop the armor
-   Only a Wolf's owner can shear a Wolf Armor from it, and with this in mind; Dispensers cannot remove Wolf Armor from wolves.
-   If a Wolf dies while wearing armor, it will drop the armor.

## Changes

-   Renamed scutes that come from Turtles to Turtle Scutes
-   Llamas and Shulkers are no longer able to destroy armor stands

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 27

## Data Pack 27

-   Llamas now use a new damage type `spit` instead of `mob_projectile`
-   `FactorCalculationData` has been removed from mob effect instance tags
-   Added `generic.scale` attribute that can be used to rescale any living entity
-   Player reach distance can now be controlled with the `generic.block_interaction_range` and `generic.entity_interaction_range` attributes
-   The maximum number of blocks that an entity can step up without jumping is now controlled by the `generic.step_height` attribute

## Experimental Features

### Breeze

-   Added a new 'whirl' idle sound
-   Added a 'charging up attack' sound
-   Added a sound that plays while the Breeze is in the air
-   Added a projectile deflection sound

This snapshot brings about a few redstone-focused changes. Notably, we’re tweaking the tick delay behavior of the crafter and the copper bulb while they’re still in experimental development.

With these changes, we aim to make the crafter more consistent with other blocks that drop or eject items, and the copper bulb with other blocks that react or change state when a connected redstone signal changes. As a result of this, some contraptions built during the last few snapshots may no longer work properly.

We're really excited about the tinkering opportunities both these new redstone blocks bring to the world. Please keep sending all your thoughts about them to Minecraft Feedback so we can keep building Minecraft together!

Enjoy!

## Changes

-   Updated Crafter textures

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 25

## Data Pack Version 25

-   Added individual display names for scoreboard entries

### Commands

#### `scoreboard`

##### Display names

-   Each entry in a scoreboard can now have a custom display name
-   Those values are kept separate per objective and score holder
-   If the name is not present, the score holder name is used (i.e. the old behavior)
-   If the score is reset or the whole objective is removed, the name is not preserved
-   Team decorations will still be applied to names as normal
-   Subcommands for managing names:
    -   `scoreboard players display name <targets> <objective> <text component>` - set display name
    -   `scoreboard players display name <targets> <objective>` - clear display name

##### Display name auto-update

-   To make display name management easier, objectives can also be configured to auto-update display names on every score update
-   This option is disabled by default
-   If a score holder has no display name (because it can't be attributed to any currently loaded entity), the current name is preserved
-   Command to control auto-update for objective:
    -   `scoreboard objectives modify <scoreboard> displayautoupdate [true|false]`

##### Number formatting

-   Scores in numeric form can now be formatted
-   Formats can be set for both objectives and individual scores
-   Scores with set formats will render the same in all context (sidebar, under player name, etc.)
-   Subcommands for managing formats:
    -   `scoreboard objectives modify <objective> numberformat <format>` - for setting default format for an objective
    -   `scoreboard objectives modify <objective> numberformat` - for clearing default format for an objective
    -   `scoreboard players display numberformat <targets> <score> <format>` - for setting format for a specific score holder
    -   `scoreboard players display numberformat <targets> <score>` - for clearing format for a specific score holder

Formats:

-   `styled <style>` - score will be displayed with selected style (like `{"bold":true}`)
-   `fixed <text component>` - score will be replaced with text
-   `blank` - score will not be displayed
