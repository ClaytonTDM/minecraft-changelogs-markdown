# Minecraft Snapshot 22w05a

While we work on some larger changes that aren't quite ready yet, here's snapshot 22w05a which contains a small squishing (that's a word, right?) of bugs.

Happy mining!

## Changes in 22w05a

-   A change in 22w03a that re-arranged Badlands biome layouts has been reverted to avoid causing generation changes and chunk borders. This change will be re-introduced later.

Happy New Year! It's time for the first snapshot of 2022 to hit the shelves. This snapshot series will be leading up to the release of 1.18.2. With this release we aim to address a few issues before moving on and starting with the Wild Update snapshots.

This snapshot contains tweaks to the world seed input and adds a new `placefeature` command. On top of that, it also fixes a bunch of bugs.

Happy mining!

## Changes in 22w03a

-   A seed of the number zero is no longer handled as a special case
-   Any spaces before/after an inputted seed will now be trimmed
-   Ender chests are no longer gift wrapped around Christmas

## Technical Changes in 22w03a

-   The `locate` command now uses a namespaced id parameter
-   Added command: `placefeature`

### `placefeature`

New command that places a configured feature at a given location. Syntax: `placefeature <id> [pos]`

Parameters:

-   `id`: The namespaced id of a configured feature to place
-   `pos`: The position to use as the origin for the feature placement (if omitted, `~ ~ ~` is used)

Another snapshot is now available. We've added new world generation below existing chunks, and blocks and fluids are now also part of the simulation distance setting. We also fixed a few bugs.

Keep in mind that we're still working on the world upgrades, so making a backup before upgrading is still a good idea.

Enjoy!

## New Features in 21w44a

-   New world generation is now inserted under existing chunks when upgrading a world to the new world height
-   Added an Online options screen where you can now find the Realms Notifications option and Difficulty when on a server
-   Added an "Allow Server Listings" option to opt-out of having your name displayed in server listings

## Changes in 21w44a

-   Sleeping now only resets the weather cycle if it was raining
-   Blocks and fluids are now also affected by simulation distance. It might be a good idea to test that the behavior of your Redstone contraptions remained the same
-   Optimized entity collisions

## Technical Changes in 21w44a

-   Servers can now set property `hide-online-players` to `true` in order to not send a player list on status requests
-   When JFR profiling is started from an external source, the JFR events for network packets are now aggregated instead of one event per packet

Here's a snapshot from the blender! In this snapshot, world generation around the edges of an old world will now be adjusted for a smoother transition! This is the first iteration of this system which we expect to keep improving. Keep in mind that if you try it out now, the result will be saved to your world forever - which, as we know, is quite a long time. Better be safe than sorry. Make a backup before you try it!

Also - the space underneath existing chunks is now filled in, but only with deepslate. We will later be adding full cave generation in this place, so if you want that in your world, make a backup before you try it!

Due to some updates to terrain generation in this snapshot, seeds have shuffled once again so worlds will not look like they did in the previous snapshot. We expect world seeds to be stable after this snapshot.

Oh yeah, did we mention that it's a good idea to make a backup?

## New Features in 21w43a

-   The edge between old and new world generation is now adjusted when you upgrade a world

### Upgrading of old worlds

-   When generating close to old chunks hew terrain is adjusted to better match the existing terrain at the borders
-   In old chunks, if there is Bedrock at y=0, the column below will be filled with Deepslate
    -   Worlds upgraded in this snapshot will permanently have this deepslate, so if you want new caves under height 0 later, make sure to keep a backup before upgrading
-   The old Bedrock between y=0 and y=4 in old chunks gets replaced with Deepslate
-   A new Bedrock layer is placed at y=-64

## Changes in 21w43a

-   The Priority Updates video setting has been renamed to Chunk Builder
-   Reduced the amount of flooded caves near river and ocean coastlines
-   Aquifer water levels change less often, so you'll more often have larger areas with the same water level. This means slightly fewer underground waterfalls and slightly easier underground boat travel
-   Lava aquifers are slightly less common
-   Restricted Big Dripleaf placement to Clay, Grass, Dirt, Farmland, Moss, Rooted Dirt, Podzol and Mycelium

## Technical Changes in 21w43a

-   Some internal details of block and fluid ticking have been changed to improve save times. While it should behave exactly as it was, it might be a good time to test your redstone contraptions (on a copy of a world or with a backup, of course)
-   The Chunk format has been updated

### World Data: Chunk Format

-   Removed chunk's `Level` and moved everything it contained up
-   Chunk's `Level.Entities` has moved to `entities`
-   Chunk's `Level.TileEntities` has moved to `block_entities`
-   Chunk's `Level.TileTicks` and `Level.ToBeTicked` have moved to `block_ticks`
-   Chunk's `Level.LiquidTicks` and `Level.LiquidsToBeTicked` have moved to `fluid_ticks`
-   Chunk's `Level.Sections` has moved to `sections`
-   Chunk's `Level.Structures` has moved to `structures`
-   Chunk's `Level.Structures.Starts` has moved to `structures.starts`
-   Chunk's `Level.Sections[].BlockStates` and `Level.Sections[].Palette` have moved to a container structure in `sections[].block_states`
-   Chunk's `Level.Biomes` are now paletted and live in a similar container structure in `sections[].biomes`
-   Added `yPos` the minimum section y position in the chunk
-   Added `below_zero_retrogen` containing data to support below zero generation
-   Added `blending_data` containing data to support blending new world generation with existing chunks

## Fixed bugs in 21w43a

-   [MC-131930](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-131930) Deep warm ocean generates without coral and sea pickles

It's time for a musical snapshot! We're now introducing new music for Caves & Cliffs: Part II. This time around we have a bunch of new tracks composed by the talented Lena Raine and Kumi Tanioka. These tracks are also available on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/7yQIrNTf3pBu0FdyAJqTqb?si=CC31NZyIQrOl-MNVCNYYkQ) for you to listen to, and they will soon be available on other services such as Apple Music and YouTube as well.

This snapshot also includes a few additional tweaks, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

**We still highly recommend backing up your world before loading it in this snapshot.**

## New Features in 21w42a

-   New music has been added to the game
-   Added world autosave indicator for single-player worlds

### Music

-   Added new music by Lena Raine and Kumi Tanioka to the Overworld (when playing in survival mode) and the main menu
-   Added a new music disc from Lena Raine titled 'otherside'. This can be found rarely in Stronghold corridor chests or much more rarely in Dungeon chests.

## Changes in 21w42a

-   World spawn selection algorithm has been reworked, now spawns player according to climate parameters
-   World generation tweaks

### World Generation

-   Lava springs can generate in mountains and snowy terrain
-   Water springs don't generate higher than y 192, and are slightly less common
-   Badlands gold generates higher up

## Technical Changes in 21w42a

-   Replaced `light` and `barrier` particles with `block_marker`

### Particles

#### `block_marker`

-   Renders with texture declared in `particle` slot for model assigned to configured block state
-   Summoned with same syntax as `block` particle (i.e. `block_marker wheat[age=2]`)

Have a random snapshot! In this snapshot, we've replaced the random number generator used for world generation, which makes more seeds come out as different... but it also moves everything around in the world, so expect all worlds to look different in this snapshot.

Another thing that we've replaced is the cubemap - the spinning image that you see behind the main menu. It's pretty sweet!

Also, in case you missed it, we're having our [annual Minecraft Live event](https://www.minecraft.net/live) this Saturday. Make sure to check that out!

**We still highly recommend backing up your world before loading it in this snapshot.**

## Changes in 21w41a

**We still highly recommend backing up your world before loading it in this snapshot.**

## Changes in 21w40a

-   World generation tweaks
-   Changes to mob spawning
-   Copper Ore now drops 2-5 (from 2-3) Raw Copper items
-   In the Stonecutter, a Block of Copper can be converted to four Cut Copper
-   A bunch of biome variant with similar features but different shapes have been merged into one, since the shape is controlled independently now
-   Renamed some biomes

### World Generation

-   Updated ore distribution to make branch mining deep down more rewarding. [Updated ore distribution chart](TODO)
    -   For example, added more unexposed diamonds
    -   Iron ore now generates above 80, with more iron ore as you go higher
    -   Extra gold generates below height -48
-   Non-cave biomes no longer change with height - so no more savannas in the sky and things like that
-   Tweaked the relative size of some biomes to match 1.17 a bit closer.
-   Increased the average size of most biomes (this also means biomes aren't in the same places as before)
-   Fixed some aquifer issues (a side effect of this is that aquifers are in different places now compared to last snapshot)
-   Slightly increased the frequency of underwater magma
-   Increased the amount of dungeons, especially below height 0
-   Gravel now generates below height 0
-   Villages are slightly more spread out
-   Removed water lake features, Aquifers provide local water levels

### Mob Spawns

-   Axolotls now only spawn in water, above clay blocks, in lush caves
-   Glowsquids now only spawn in water blocks, under height 30
-   Cod, Salmon, Pufferfish, Tropical Fish, Squid and Dolphins now only spawn in water from height 50 to height 64
-   Tropical Fish now also spawn in lush caves at any height
-   Zombies once again spawn in dripstone caves - drowned can also spawn there however
-   Goats no longer spawn in stony peaks

## Technical Changes in 21w40a

-   Optimized AI for Axolotls, Goats, Hoglins, Zoglins, Piglins, Piglin Brutes and Villagers
-   Bedrock layers generate dependent on the world seed now

Time for an Advanced snapshot! In this snapshot, you can also open worlds from previous versions again - with one big warning! The blending technology we intend to introduce for Caves & Cliffs: Part II is not yet available. If you open an old world in this snapshot it will be upgraded with air under the current bottom of the world and visible chunk borders to new areas.

**We highly recommend backing up your world before loading it in this snapshot.**

## New Features in 21w39a

-   Added Caves & Cliffs: Part II Advancements

### Advancements

-   Added "Caves & Cliffs" for falling from top to bottom of the Overworld
-   Added "Feels like home" for riding strider on lava for 50 blocks in the Overworld
-   Added "Star Trader" for trading with a villager at the build height limit
-   Added "Sound of Music" for playing music with a jukebox in a Meadow biome

## Changes in 21w39a

-   Tweaked peaks to make small mountains look more like proper jagged mountain peaks instead of flat hilly mounds
-   The lone trees in Meadows now always contain a bee nest
-   Drowned can spawn in aquifers inside dripstone caves
-   Zombies don't spawn in dripstone caves
-   Buried treasure chests can now contain water breathing potions
-   Changed default brightness to 50
-   Redesigned how effects look in the inventory screen, to allow them to show even with recipe book open

### Effects

-   Your list of effects are now shown to the right of your inventory, instead of the left side
-   When the inventory effects list is visible, it will be hidden from the game view to reduce screen clutter
-   There's now two modes of seeing the effect list: compact and classic
    -   Classic is the pre-existing list of effects, one after another
    -   Compact is a single icon for each effect, suitable for small screen estate
-   The game will automatically switch between the two looks to suit the available screen estate (including having the recipe book open)

## Technical Changes in 21w39a

-   Added `fall_from_height` and `ride_entity_distance` advancement triggers
-   Changed `nether_travel` to match other similar triggers
-   Added new loot table function `set_potion`
-   Changes to the on-disk chunk format
-   Resource pack format has been increased to 8
-   Standalone `server.jar` now bundles contains individual libraries instead of being flat archive

### Advancements

#### New triggers

##### `fall_from_height`

-   Triggered when a player lands after falling
-   Conditions:
    -   `player` - a player for which this trigger runs
    -   `start_position` - location predicate for last position before falling started
    -   `distance` - predicate for distance between `start_position` and player

##### `ride_entity_in_lava`

-   Triggered for every tick when player rides in lava
-   Conditions
    -   `player` - a player for which this trigger runs
    -   `start_position` - position where riding started (first tick on lava)
    -   `distance` - predicate for distance between `start_position` and player

#### Changed triggers

##### `nether_travel`

-   `entered` condition renamed to `start_position`
-   `exited` has been removed, since it was identical to `player.location`

### Loot Tables

#### New functions

##### `set_potion`

Sets `Potion` tag on any item

###### Parameters:

-   `id` - potion id

### World Data: Chunk Format

-   Chunk's `Level.Sections[].BlockStates` & `Level.Sections[].Palette` have moved to a container structure in `Level.Sections[].block_states`
-   Chunk's `Level.Biomes` are now paletted and live in a similar container structure in `Level.Sections[].biomes`
-   Chunk's `Level.CarvingMasks[]` is now `long[]` instead of `byte[]`

### Resource Pack format

-   `minecraft/textures/gui/container/inventory.png` now contains an extra sprite for a thin-layout version of the effect list in the inventory

### Server bundling

-   `server.jar` now bundles individual libraries instead of merging all the files into single archive
-   This change is meant to solve certain problems related to Java modules
-   On startup, `server.jar` will unpack libraries into directory configured by `bundlerRepoDir` (default: working directory)
-   To run different main class than server, use `bundlerMainClass` property (for example `java -DbundlerMainClass=net.minecraft.data.Main -jar server.jar --reports`) or unpack jar manually and use contents of `META-INF/classpath-joined` for command line

## Fixed bugs in 21w39a

-   [MC-116359](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-116359) Status effects aren't displayed in inventory when recipe book is open
-   [MC-149822](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-149822) Bottom border on status effect displays in the inventory is missing
-   [MC-193348](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-193348) Status effect bars shift the player's inventory in creative mode

The second Caves & Cliffs: Part II snapshot is here! This snapshot mostly contains tweaks and bug fixes, but there are also some new technical additions such as a separate simulation distance slider and an increased thread count (no I'm not talking about the fancy sheets you're thinking about buying).

Oh, and you also seemed to enjoy Strongholds quite a lot, so we decided to add them back into the game. Enjoy!

## Known Issues in 21w38a

-   This snapshot is still not compatible with older worlds - to play in this snapshot, you will have to create a new world
-   World saving can sometimes take a very long time - if you see the world stop moving for a time, this is why

## Changes in 21w38a

-   Sprinting is no longer reduced to walking when gently brushing your sleeve against a wall
-   Fixes for the distribution of ores

### Ore distribution

-   Copper ore generates up to y 95 (as originally designed)
-   Increased the amount of copper
-   Lapis lazuli generates in blobs, like other ores (instead of spread out)

### Sprinting

-   Previously, any collision with a block would reduce sprinting to walking. Now, for very minor angles of collision with a block, players retain their sprint. For larger angles of collision, the old behavior is retained.

## Technical Changes in 21w38a

-   A new setting has been added: "Simulation distance"
-   Maximum amount of background threads increased
-   Added telemetry for world loading

### Simulation distance setting

-   Entities will not be updated outside of simulation distance.
-   Allows higher render distance with less CPU load.
-   A new slider in video settings on the client.
-   A new `simulation-distance` property in dedicated server properties.
-   We will continue working on it with a goal of simulation distance also affecting block and fluid ticking.

### Maximum amount of background threads increased

Various background tasks including worldgen are executed on a background thread pool. Its size equals the amount of available CPU threads minus one, but there was an upper limit of 7. Now this upper limit is 255. This should help higher-end machines with world-gen performance.

The upper limit can be overridden by `max.bg.threads` Java system property, for example when running multiple servers on a single machine.

### Telemetry

In this release, we are re-introducing diagnostic tracking, which was part of Minecraft: Java Edition until 2018. We are bringing it back to better understand our players and to improve their experience. Specifically, we hope to ensure stronger performance for the extremely heavy world generation in the second part of the Caves & Cliffs update later this year.

In practice, this can mean identifying technical pain points in the game, like how less powerful hardware performs in high-complexity terrain. This information will also help us prioritize various aspects of development, balance game features (by learning, for instance, that the goats are pushing every single player off the cliffs) and lend new Minecrafters a helping hand (after realizing that many of them get stuck at the same points). All data is treated according to GDPR and CCPA best practices and is used to develop a better-performing and generally more enjoyable Minecraft: Java Edition.

At this point the only implemented event is world load.

#### World Load event

-   Sent when loading singleplayer world or connecting to multiplayer server
-   Contains following information:
    -   launcher identifier
    -   user identitifer (XUID)
    -   client session id (changes on restart)
    -   world session id (changes per world load, to be reused for later events)
    -   game version
    -   operating system name and version
    -   Java runtime version
    -   if client or server is modded (same information as on crash logs)
    -   server type (single player, Realms or other)
    -   game mode

## Bugs fixed in 21w38a

Marvellous mountains and colossal caves, this snapshot has it all! Today we're bringing the Overworld revamp to regular snapshots. If you've been playing or checking out the experimental snapshots that we've been releasing, you should be familiar with what you're seeing. If not, you're in for a treat!

Since we're extending the world height, and there are quite a few under-the-hood changes, we've been keeping an eye on how the game is running, and there are still improvements to be made. However, we would still appreciate it if you would be able to take this survey so that we can understand how you perceive the performance of this snapshot.

It should also be noted that there is currently no upgrade path for existing worlds in this snapshot. This means that you can only create new worlds in this snapshot, and not play on any of your existing worlds. We're working on this and you should be able to play on your existing worlds in an upcoming snapshot not too far in the future.

All of this said, we hope that you have a great time checking out these new additions. Watch your feet so that you don't fall into a very deep hole, and make sure you don't get punted off a mountain by a goat that's just minding its own business.

Happy mining!

## New Features in 21w37a

-   Added noise caves and aquifers
-   Added Dripstone Caves underground biome
-   Added Grove biome
-   Added Lofty peaks biome
-   Added Lush Caves underground biome
-   Added Meadow biome
-   Added Snowcapped peaks biome
-   Added Snowy slopes biome
-   Added Stony peaks biome
-   New ore distribution and large ore veins
-   Overworld build and generation limits have been expanded

### Blocks

-   Enchanting Tables now emit a low amount of light
-   Using shears on the tip of a Cave Vine, Twisting Vine, Weeping Wine or Kelp now causes it to stop growing

### Dripstone Caves biome

-   Contains plenty of Pointed Dripstone and Dripstone Block on the floors and ceilings, and small pools of water
-   In some places you'll find larger stalagmites, stalactites, and columns built from Dripstone Blocks
-   Contains extra copper ore

### Grove

-   Snowy terrain with big spruce trees and powder snow traps. Might want to wear leather boots!
-   Tends to generate on high-altitude terrain beneath mountain peaks or on hilltops.
-   Spawns wolfs, rabbits, and foxes.

### Large ore veins

-   Ore veins are large, rare, snake-like underground ore formations
-   Copper veins form between y 0 and y 50 and are mixed with Granite
-   Iron veins form below y -60 and y -8 and are mixed with Tuff

### Lofty peaks

-   Dramatic jagged mountain peaks with snow and stone
-   Spawns goats

### Lush Caves biome

-   Moss covers the floors and ceilings
-   Spore Blossoms grow from the ceiling and drip particles
-   Contains Clay pools with Dripleaf plants growing out of them
-   Contains Azalea Bushes and Flowering Azalea Bushes
-   The Azalea Tree loves to have its roots in Lush Caves, so if you find an Azalea Tree (either overground or in a cave) you know there is a Lush Cave beneath you
-   Cave Vines with Glow Berries grow from the ceiling and light up the caves

### Meadow biome

-   Large grassy and flowery biome that tends to generate high up on plateaus or next to large mountain ranges.
-   Sometimes contains a lone tall oak or birch tree, often with a bee nest.
-   Think Sound of Music!
-   Spawns donkeys, rabbits, and sheep.

### Mob Spawning

-   Monsters now only spawn in places where the light from blocks is 0 (sky light still prevents spawning like before)
-   Fixed an issue where players in multiplayer can face more or far fewer enemies than intended, particularly when other players are flying

### New ore distribution

-   Changed ore generation to match the new world height, and to add more strategy to mining.
-   There is no longer a single y level that is best for all ores, you need to make tradeoffs.
-   Iron ore generates below y 72, with a strong bias towards y 16.
-   Iron ore also generates above 112, with more iron ore as you go higher.
-   Copper ore generates between y 0 and y 96, with a strong bias towards y 48.
-   Copper ore generates in larger amounts in dripstone caves biome.
-   Lapis lazuli generates below y 64, with a strong bias towards y 0. However, Lapis below y -32 or above y 32 cannot generate exposed to air. It will either be buried or inside water.
-   Coal generates above y 0, with a strong bias towards y 96 and above.
-   Coal has reduced air exposure, so you will find more coal buried or underwater than exposed to air.
-   Gold generates below y 32, with a strong bias towards y -16.
-   Extra gold can (still) be found in badlands biomes.
-   Redstone ore generates below y 16. Redstone ore generation gradually increases as you go below y -32 and further down.
-   Diamond generates below y 16, with more diamond the lower you go.
-   Diamonds have reduced air exposure, so you will find more diamond buried or underwater than exposed to air.

### Noise caves and Aquifers

-   Noise caves are a new way of generating caves, providing more natural variety. They can get really huge sometimes! Noise caves come in three flavors:
    -   Cheese caves. Like the holes in swiss cheese. These often form caverns of various size
    -   Spaghetti caves. Long squiggly tunnels, sometimes wide like tagliatelle
    -   Noodle caves. Thinner, squigglier, and more claustrophobic variant of spaghetti caves
-   No, they aren't loud. The "noise" part of noise caves is a technical term and has nothing to do with sound
-   The old cave carvers and canyons still generate, combining with the noise caves to form interesting cave systems
-   As with carvers, when noise caves intersect the surface they form cave entrances
-   An aquifer is an area with local water level, independent of sea level. Aquifers are used during world generation to generate bodies of water inside noise caves. This sometimes results in large underground lakes! They can also form inside mountains and on the surface.
-   Aquifers below y0 will sometimes be lava aquifers instead of water aquifers
-   Magma Blocks sometimes generates at the bottom of underground bodies of water
-   Underwater cave carvers and underwater canyons have been removed, since aquifers are used to generate water in caves instead

### Options

-   Added an accessibility option to stop the sky flashing during thunderstorms
-   Added an option to specify the audio device used by the game
-   Added "Toggle Sprint" and "Toggle Sneak" to the Controls settings
-   Moved Keybinds out to their own settings screen, accessible from Controls

### Snowcapped peaks

-   Smooth mountain peaks with ice and snow
-   Spawns goats and yeti. No actually just goats.

### Snowy slopes

-   Very snowy terrain that can hide powder snow traps. Might want to wear leather boots!
-   Tends to generate on high-altitude terrain beneath mountain peaks or on hilltops.
-   Spawns rabbits and goats.

### Stony peaks

-   Stony mountain peaks that may be jagged or smooth
-   Spawns goats
-   Contains strips of calcite sometimes

### World generation

-   Generation range and build limits have been expanded by 64 blocks up and 64 blocks down, to a total range of 384 blocks
-   Underground features, structures, and caves generate all the way down to y-64
-   Exception: Diorite and Granite and Andesite and Dirt don't generate below y0
-   Tweaked size and positioning of Diorite, Andesite & Granite generation
-   Dripstone clusters can no longer be found in normal caves, only in dripstone caves biome
-   Starting from y0 and below deepslate gradually replaces all stone
-   Deepslate blobs no longer generate above y0
-   The terrain shape and elevation varies dramatically, indepedently from biomes. For example, forests and deserts could form up on a hill without needing a special biome just for that
-   Less diorite/granite/andesite generates above y 60
-   Strips of gravel can generate in stony shores
-   Swamp trees can grow in water 2 blocks deep (instead of just 1 block deep)

## Changes in 21w37a

-   Illagers (Vindicator, Pillager, Evoker) no longer attack baby villagers
-   Axolotls now only spawn in lush caves
-   Axolotls now have their own, separate, mob cap
-   Raised the cloud level from 128 to 192

## Technical Changes in 21w37a

-   Replaced the clientbound chunk update network packet with another one which additionally contains light update data. Separate light update packet still exists and is sent when light update happens without chunk update.
-   View distance now causes chunks to load cylindrically around players instead of in a square
-   Information about the world generation noise is now displayed on the debug screen
-   Added `illageralt`, rune-like font from Minecraft Dungeons (currently only usable via commands)
-   Added startup option `--jfrProfile` and command `jfr` to start profiling with Java FlightRecorder as well as a few custom events.
-   Loot table functions `set_contents` and `set_loot_table` now require `type` field with valid block entity type
-   Worlds last saved before Minecraft 1.2 ("pre-anvil") no longer can be opened directly
-   Data pack format has been increased to 8
-   New video setting "Priority updates".
-   Removed length limits for scoreboard, score holder and team names
-   Mob spawners can now override light checks for spawning

### JFR Profiling

#### Custom events

-   `minecraft.ServerTickTime`: sampling event exposing average server tick times at one second intervals
-   `minecraft.ChunkGeneration`: time taken to generate individual chunk stages
-   `minecraft.PacketRead | minecraft.PacketSent`: network traffic
-   `minecraft.WorldLoadFinishedEvent`: initial world loading duration

#### Ending a profiling run

The run will then be stopped either by:

-   shutting down the JVM
-   `jfr stop` in-game command
-   `jcmd` CLI tool

#### Overview

Java Flight Recorder ([https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/328](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/328)) is the internal JVM profiling tool bundled with the Java Runtime to analyze performance and runtime characteristics. It's a useful tool for exposing internal JVM performance metrics as well as custom metrics that can be monitored or analyzed using any stock Java profiler or monitoring agents.

#### Reports

A summary JSON report is written both to the log file and in the debug folder accompanied by a `.jfr` recording ready to be analyzed in i.e JMC [https://github.com/openjdk/jmc](https://github.com/openjdk/jmc) or any other profiler tool supporting the format.

#### Starting a profiling run

A profiling run can be started using any of the following alternatives:

-   `--jfrProfile` startup flag when starting a Minecraft server or client
-   `jfr start` in-game command
-   Regular Java CLI tools such as `jcmd`

### Loot tables

#### Changed functions

##### `set_contents`, `set_loot_table`

Added new mandatory field `type`. This type will be written into `BlockEntityTag.id`, to make sure this tag can be correctly migrated between versions

### Old world conversion

-   Worlds last saved before Minecraft 1.2 ("pre-anvil") now require conversion in a previous version of a game to be able to be opened
-   Conversion works best in versions 1.6.4 and before - worlds opened for the first time in later versions will have incorrect biome information

### Priority update setting

-   This setting determines which chunks sections are updated synchronously during a single frame.
-   The most conservative option "nearby" corresponds to the state before the update.
-   The new options "by player" and "none" significantly reduce stutters when placing or removing blocks (especially light sources), but can potentially cause rare visually noticeable delays in world updates.

### Spawner data changes

-   Spawners now support the `custom_spawn_rules` NBT in the `SpawnData` field and the `SpawnPotentials` list
-   `custom_spawn_rules` currently may contain fields `block_light_limit` and `sky_light_limit` - both are integer ranges with fields `min_inclusive` and `max_inclusive`
-   To make `SpawnPotentials` format similar to other weighted lists, structure was changed to `{weight: <int>, data: <previous contents without 'Weight', 'Entity' renamed to 'entity'>}`
-   To accomodate that change, previous contents of `SpawnData` were moved to `SpawnData.entity` (making format of that field same as elements of `SpawnPotentials.data`)

Example:

    SpawnData: {
        entity: {
            id: "minecraft:cow"
        },
        custom_spawn_rules: {
              sky_light_limit: {min_inclusive: 10, max_inclusive: 15}
        },
    }
    SpawnPotentials: [
      {
        data: {
          custom_spawn_rules: {
              block_light_limit: {min_inclusive: 0, max_inclusive: 15}
          },
          entity: {id: "minecraft:pig"},
        },
        weight: 2
      },
      {
        data: {
          custom_spawn_rules: {
              block_light_limit: {min_inclusive: 5, max_inclusive: 10},
              sky_light_limit: {min_inclusive: 10, max_inclusive: 15}
          },
          entity: {id: "minecraft:panda"}
        },
        weight: 1
      }
    ]
