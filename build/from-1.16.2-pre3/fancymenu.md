Out with the old, and in with the new! Today we're introducing a new naming convention (well, it's been a while) for Minecraft Java Edition. Previously, the last pre-release was, in fact, the release candidate, but we're now making that more clear by changing the name to be "release candidate". This means that if there are no major issues following this release, no further changes will be done before the full release.

Speaking of the full release: In case you've been living under a rock (it's Minecraft, so that's OK), [we're releasing the Nether Update on Tuesday, June 23](https://www.minecraft.net/article/the-nether-update-has-date-). That's next week!

## Fixed Bugs in 1.16 Release Candidate 1

-   Fixed issues with the Nether surface generation, causing issues like floating lava and crimson forests without nylium
-   [MC-150543](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-150543) Using a stonecutter can sometimes crash the game in certain circumstances
-   [MC-174790](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-174790) Mob on turtle eggs causes the game to crash
-   [MC-181833](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-181833) Crash on world startup after playing world in 20w18a
