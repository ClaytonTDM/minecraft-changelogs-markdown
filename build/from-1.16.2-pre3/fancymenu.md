# Minecraft Snapshot 20w30a

Today we're releasing Snapshot 20w30a for Minecraft Java Edition in which we've tweaked Bastion Remnants, and given you the ability to have lanterns under water.

## Changes in 20w30a

-   Modified how respawn positions are chosen for beds and respawn anchors
-   Lanterns can now be waterlogged
-   Soul Lanterns can now be waterlogged
-   Tweaked the Bastion Remnant chest loot
-   Chests in Bastion Remnants are now more likely to be located on top of gilded blackstone

### Respawn Block Positions

-   Respawn anchors will prioritize cardinal directions over corners
-   Beds will prioritize the side of the bed the player entered from and then spaces circling around the foot of the bed up to the head of the bed
-   Respawning players will now face the block that they respawned at
-   Placing players onto dangerous blocks is now avoided when possible

## Technical Changes in 20w30a

-   The sign edit screen will now intialize from existing sign text (should have no noticeable impact on vanilla)
-   Tags can now have optional entries

### Optional Tag Entries

Entries in tags can now be marked as optional. Failure to resolve optional entries does not prevent the whole tag from loading.

Example:

    {
      "replace": false,
      "values": [
        "#minecraft:beds", // existing syntax
        { "id":"#missing:tag", "required": false }, // optional sub-tag entry
    "minecraft:anvil", // existing syntax
    { "id":"minecraft:stone_button", "required": true }, // new syntax for required tags
    { "id":"missing:block", "required": false } // optional single-element entry

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w28a

This week's snapshot introduces experimental support for custom biomes in data packs. This work has involved redoing some of the internal plumbing of things behind the scene, so it might be a bit leaky. We hope no important parts drip out, but if they do, pick them back up for us, please.

As always, make sure to make backups if you try a world in a snapshot.

## Changes in 20w28a

​

-   Villagers now emit green particles when joining a village, setting a home bed, or acquiring a job site/profession
-   Brewing stands can now be crafted with blackstone
-   Tweaked bartering loot
-   Totems of undying now give the fire resistance status affect for 40 seconds when activated

​

## Technical Changes in 20w28a

​

-   Custom worlds now support custom biomes
-   Dedicated servers can now rate limit clients

​

### Customized world generation

​

-   There is now experimental support for a `worldgen` folder in data packs
-   `worldgen/biome` can contain biome definitions
-   `worldgen/configured_carver` can contain definitions for world carver settings
-   `worldgen/configured_feature` can contain definitions for feature placements
-   `worldgen/configured_structure_feature` can contain definitions for structure placements
-   `worldgen/configured_surface_builder` can contain definitions for surfaces
-   `worldgen/processor_list` can contain sets of block processors
-   `worldgen/template_pool` can contain pool definitions for jigsaw structures
-   Custom biomes can now be used in the single biome/caves/floating islands world types (add the data pack containing the biome first)
-   Custom biomes can now be used in custom dimension generators

​

### Dedicated server packet limit

​

-   Dedicated servers can now kick clients that consistently send too many packets within a second
-   Controlled with the `rate-limit` settings in `server.properties`
-   The default rate limit of 0 means "no limit"

​

# Minecraft 1.16 Release Candidate

Out with the old, and in with the new! Today we're introducing a new naming convention (well, it's been a while) for Minecraft Java Edition. Previously, the last pre-release was, in fact, the release candidate, but we're now making that more clear by changing the name to be "release candidate". This means that if there are no major issues following this release, no further changes will be done before the full release.

Speaking of the full release: In case you've been living under a rock (it's Minecraft, so that's OK), [we're releasing the Nether Update on Tuesday, June 23](https://www.minecraft.net/article/the-nether-update-has-date-). That's next week!

## Fixed Bugs in 1.16 Release Candidate 1

-   Fixed issues with the Nether surface generation, causing issues like floating lava and crimson forests without nylium
-   [MC-150543](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-150543) Using a stonecutter can sometimes crash the game in certain circumstances
