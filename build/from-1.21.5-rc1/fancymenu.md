# 1.21.5 Release Candidate 1

With Minecraft Live just around the corner, we are getting closer to the release of the first drop of the year. Today we're shipping the first 1.21.5 Release Candidate with a few bug fixes, which means if no new critical issues surface, this is the version we are planning to release as Minecraft: Java Edition 1.21.5.

## Fixed bugs in 1.21.5 Release Candidate 1

-   [MC-295383](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-295383) "Received missed or reordered chat message from server" string doesn't make logical sense

-   [MC-295416](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-295416) Beacon receives wrong shading from nearby blocks

It's Tuesday, and today we're bringing you a third pre-release for Minecraft 1.21.5, with some fixes to recently introduced issues.

## Fixed bugs in 1.21.5 Pre-Release 3

We're shipping some crash fixes in today's pre-release.

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 71 since this was missed in Pre-Release 1

## Fixed bugs in 1.21.5 Pre-Release 2

-   [MC-280482](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-280482) Main menu is totally broken when using Mesa 25.0
-   [MC-296644](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-296644) Game crashes while rendering section / java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot read field "b" because "$$3" is null
-   Additional crash fixes

---

Today we're shipping the first pre-release of Minecraft 1.21.5. From now on you will mostly see bug fixes and technical tweaks until the start of the next snapshot cycle. As we enter the pre-release phase we will be releasing more frequently than our regular cadence on Wednesdays, so keep an eye out for the next pre-release!

## Changes

-   Added Spawn Eggs textures for programmer art texture pack

## Technical Changes

-   The Resource Pack version is now 55
-   Arguments in commands that accept inline values like loot tables, predicates, modifiers, data components, formatted text (`/loot`, `/give`, `/tellraw`, `/execute if predicate`, data components in `/execute if items`, etc.) have been reverted to accept numbers in place of booleans

> **Developer's Note**: The original change happened because we moved away from using NBT as an intermediate format for parsing those values, which meant that booleans were separated from numbers (similar to handling in JSON). We've decided to temporarily revert that, since some functionality can't be achieved yet without using storage and macro functions. However, once that missing functionality is added (and data can be transferred without being converted to and from text), legacy boolean handling will be removed once again.

### Network Protocol

-   The clientbound `player_chat` packet now contains an index increasing for every message sent to the client
    -   The index starts at 0 when logging in (or is reset by configuration phase and the `login` packet)
    -   For every message, the server should increment this value by 1
    -   If this value updates in an unexpected way, the client will disconnect
    -   As the protocol requires that every chat packet reaches the client in produced order, the goal is to enable faster detection of missed/reordered chat messages for custom server developers
-   The serverbound `chat` and `chat_command_signed` packets now contain a checksum byte along with the 'last seen' update
    -   This is a simple hash of the 'last seen' signatures which should be reconstructed by the server, allowing quicker detection of desynchronized state
    -   This can be passed as `0` to disable the check, for compatibility with protocol translation

## Resource Pack Version 55

-   Tweaked Leaf Litter block models

## Fixed bugs in 1.21.5 Pre-Release 1

-   [MC-280480](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-280480) No flint and steel clicking sound when attempting to ignite TNT with a flint and steel when the "tntExplodes" gamerule is disabled
-   [MC-280493](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-280493) If the tntExplodes game rule is changed to false while primed TNT already exists in the world, the primed TNT explodes as normal

The first pre-release of Minecraft 1.21.4 is now available. Today's update and for the remainder of the 1.21.4 cycle, you will mostly see bug fixes and tweaks. In addition to that, pre-releases don't follow the regular snapshot cadence of releasing only on Wednesdays, so keep an eye out for the next pre-release.

As always, a big thank you to the community for your feedback, bugs reported, and awesome ideas throughout the snapshot series. Let the pre-releases commence!

## Technical Changes

-   The Resource Pack version is now 46
-   Similarly to block items, Spawn Eggs for entities that could execute operator-only commands now have a warning in tooltip

## Resource Pack Version 46

-   Added a way of suppressing first-person hand animation on item change for specific models
-   Unifont has been updated to 16.0.01

### Item models

-   A new field has been added to the client-side item info format (i.e. files in `/assets/*/items/*.json`)
    -   `hand_animation_on_swap` - boolean field describing if down-and-up animation should be played in first-person view when item stack is changed (either type, count or components), default: `true`
        -   only value from new item is taken into account
        -   does not control "pop" animation in GUI when item is picked or changes count

#### `minecraft:model` item model type

##### Added `minecraft:team` tint source type

-   Returns team color of context entity, if any

    -   `default` - RGB value to return when there is no context entity, entity is not in a team or team has no color

-   No fields

##### Renamed property `minecraft:holder_type` to `minecraft:context_entity_type`

**Developer's Note**: _Context entities were initially used only for compasses and clocks, which means that type is available only in rendering contexts where those items would show correct reading (see MC-186797 and related bugs). The name change has been made to better reflect that._

##### Added `minecraft:context_dimension` property

-   Returns the ID of the dimension in context, if any
-   No fields
