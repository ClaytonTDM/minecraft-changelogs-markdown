# Minecraft 1.21.2 Release Candidate 2

We were so worried that you had forgotten all about us over the weekend, so we're kicking this week off with a surprise second Release Candidate for 1.21.2! Let's hope this is (fingers crossed) the last one before the full release of Bundles of Bravery.

If no other critical issues are found, this will be the version for 1.21.2 that can be expected to be released later this week.

Happy mining!
