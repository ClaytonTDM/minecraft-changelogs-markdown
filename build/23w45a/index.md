# Minecraft Snapshot 23w45a

We're happy to share another snapshot, this time offering an early look at some exciting new adventures waiting for you underground in the form of Trial Chambers!

Trial Chambers are designed to be challenging moments of combat and exploration hidden medium-deep below the surface of the Overworld. Trial Chambers bring new decorative and lighting blocks, new Trial Spawners to deliver a different style of multi-mob fights, and the bushy-browed Breeze, a new mob specific to Trial Chambers which will add quite a bit of chaos to your combats.

Happy Mining!

## Experimental Features

### Added Breeze mob

-   The Breeze is a cunning, hostile mob that can spawn via Trial Spawner in some rooms within the Trial Chambers
-   The Breeze moves primarily by leaping around the target, sometimes jumping quite long distances
-   An aggressive adversary, the Breeze shoots volatile wind energy in the form of wind charge projectiles at its target
-   Wind charges deal a small amount of damage when colliding directly with an entity
-   After colliding with an entity or a block, wind charge projectiles produce a wind burst, which knocks back entities in the area by several blocks
-   Wind bursts also have the effect of 'activating' certain blocks:
    -   Non-Iron Doors and Trapdoors are flipped
    -   Fence Gates are flipped
    -   Buttons are pressed
    -   Levers are flipped
    -   Bells are rung and swung
    -   Lit Candles (both standalone and on cake) are extinguished
-   Wind bursts do not have any effect on Iron Doors, Iron Trapdoors, or any block being held in its position by a Redstone signal

### Trial Spawner

-   Trial Spawner is a new variant of Monster Spawners that ejects rewards upon completion and can have variable levels of challenge in multiplayer
-   The challenge level will increase for each new player a Trial Spawner notices nearby
    -   Challenge level will not decrease until it is reset during a Trial Spawner's cooldown
-   Unlike normal spawners, a Trial Spawner will spawn a limited number of mobs proportional to its current challenge level
    -   It can only spawn a mob at positions that are within line of sight
    -   It can spawn a mob regardless of any light level requirement the mob has
    -   Spawned mobs are persistent
-   Once all mobs are defeated, the Trial Spawner will eject a set of rewards proportional to the current challenge level
    -   After the rewards have been ejected, the Trial Spawner goes into cooldown for 30 minutes during which it will no longer spawn mobs
-   Trial Spawners cannot be crafted nor obtained by players in Survival - instead, they can be found naturally placed throughout Trial Chambers
-   Trial Spawners are extremely slow to mine and resistant to explosions, and will not drop even with Silk Touch
-   When placed in Creative, Trial Spawners have no mob type set by default
    -   The mob type can be set by interacting with it while holding a Spawn Egg
-   Creative and Spectator players cannot be detected or noticed by Trial Spawners

### Trial Chambers

-   Trial Chambers are a new structure in the Overworld where players can explore and take on combat challenges during the mid-game
    -   Trial Chambers are made out of a variety of Copper and Tuff blocks and can be found in different sizes from large to small
    -   Trial Chambers are a relatively common find throughout the Deepslate layer of the underground
-   The layout of each Trial Chamber is procedurally generated, and can include traps, reward chests and a variety of combat spaces
    -   Supply chests can be found between different rooms, and give you blocks and items which help you navigate your trials
    -   Reward chests are guarded by challenges in each room, and can be a source of many high level enchanted books and equipment
    -   The loot found in reward chests are still being iterated, and are absolutely not final
-   Each Trial Chamber will include Trial Spawners with a melee, small melee, or ranged category:
    -   Melee
        -   Zombie
        -   Husk
        -   Slime
    -   Small Melee
        -   Spider
        -   Cave Spider
        -   Baby Zombie
        -   Silverfish
    -   Ranged
        -   Skeleton
        -   Stray
        -   Skeleton with Poison Tipped Arrows
-   Each Trial Spawner category will only use one mob for the entire structure when generated, and these mobs are randomized for each Trial Chamber
    -   For example, one Trial Chamber might only spawn Zombies, Cave Spiders and Strays, while another might only spawn Slimes, Silverfish and Skeletons
    -   The exceptions to this are some Trial Spawners in unique rooms which always spawn Breezes

#### Known issues

-   The corridors sometimes end with a dead end
-   Aquifers, Lush Caves, and Sculk Veins sometimes intersect with the Trial Chamber

### Trial Key

-   An item that can only be obtained from Trial Spawners
-   Trial Keys do not currently have any functionality
