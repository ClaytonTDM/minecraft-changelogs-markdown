We've now released 1.16 pre-release 2, fixing some crashes. Note that worlds opened in 1.16 pre-release 1 are corrupt and will not work in any way in 1.16 pre-release 2 (this includes using the re-create world button). Please restore an older backup or create a brand new world to play in this pre-release.
