# Minecraft: Java Edition 1.21.1

It will soon be time for new snapshots, but before that: we are now releasing Minecraft 1.21.1. This is a hotfix version that addresses some critical exploits.

We highly recommend that server owners upgrade to this version. Players on Minecraft 1.21 will be able to join servers running on 1.21.1.

## Changes

-   Fixed critical exploits that could be used to crash servers
-   Added language support for Tzotzil and Belarusian (Latin)
