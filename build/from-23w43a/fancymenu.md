## Changes

-   The Bat now has a new look
-   Thrown Ender Pearls produce a teleportation sound on impact
-   Small tweaks to the Telemetry Data Collection screen

### Bat

-   The Bat has an updated model, animations and texture

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 22
-   The Resource Pack version is now 20

## Data Pack Version 22

-   Added `tick` command
-   Added two new input fields for Selection Priority and Placement Priority in the Jigsaw block edit screen
-   Added `item` to `minecraft:arrow` and `minecraft:spectral_arrow`, this is the item that will be picked up
-   Renamed `Trident` to `item` in `minecraft:trident`

### `tick` command

Added a new `tick` command. This is an adminstative and debugging command that allows to control the ticking flow and measure the performance of the game. The command requires elevated permissions (admins and above) and so it is not by default available in command blocks and datapacks.

Syntax:

`tick query` - outputs the current target ticking rate, with information about the tick times performance.

`tick rate <rate>` - sets a custom target ticking rate to the specified value. The value must be greater than 1.0 and lower than 10000.0. Setting a very low tick rate can cause the game to feel unresponsive and setting too high tick rate for your system can cause the game to crash as the game now assumes, it is constantly falling behind the ticking target. Please use `tick query` or `<F3> + 2` (Integrated server only) debug screen to measure the performance of the game and adjust the tick rate accordingly. Setting a tick target lower than the default `20.0` will also cause the players to be simulated at a lower rate (including player movement and input controls), while setting a higher tick rate will cause the players to be simulated at the default rate of `20` ticks per second to maintain the expected responsiveness of the game, but can cause artifacts in entities interpolation.

`tick freeze` - freezes all gameplay elements, except for players and any entity a player is riding. This is useful for debugging and isolating issues with the game allowing the player to move around freely and inspect the world.

`tick step <time>` - Only works when the game is frozen. It runs the game for the specified number of ticks and then freezes the game again. This allows to step through the game a set amount of ticks at a time.

`tick step stop` - stops the current stepping process, and re-freezes the game.

`tick unfreeze` - unfreezes the game and resumes all gameplay elements.

`tick sprint <time>` - runs the game while ignoring the set ticking target rate (meaning that the game will run as fast as possible) for the specified number of ticks. At the end of the sprint, the game will resume the previous ticking target and display performance information about the tick times while sprinting. This is especially useful for testing gameplay elements that are time dependent, such as redstone contraptions, or mob behaviour in isolated environments that allow for much faster simulation.

`tick sprint stop` - stops the current tick sprint, and resumes the previous ticking target.

### Jigsaw Selection & Placement Priority

-   Selection Priority
    -   When the parent piece is being processed for connections, this controls the order in which this Jigsaw block attempts to connect to its target piece
    -   Jigsaws will be processed in descending priority order and randomly within the same priority
-   Placement Priority
    -   When this Jigsaw block connects to a piece, this is the order in which that piece is processed for connections in the wider structure
    -   Pieces will be processed in descending priority order with the default insertion order breaking ties within the same priority
-   This functionality has been added to support the ability for Jigsaw structures to generate branches in a depth-first order, as well as give finer control over ordering of connections
-   All existing Jigsaw blocks will default their Selection and Placement Priority to 0, resulting in the same behaviour as before these two configurable values were introduced

## Resource Pack Version 20

-   `bat.png` has been updated for the new Bat model
-   Added block models, items models and block state definitions for the following blocks:
    -   `chiseled_copper`, `exposed_chiseled_copper`, `weathered_chiseled_copper`, `oxidized_chiseled_copper`
    -   `copper_grate`, `expxosed_copper_grate`, `weathered_copper_grate`, `oxidized_copper_grate`
    -   `copper_bulb`, `exposed_copper_bulb`, `weathered_copper_bulb`, `oxidized_copper_bulb`
    -   `copper_door`, `exposed_copper_door`, `weathered_copper_door`, `oxidized_copper_door`
    -   `copper_trapdoor`, `exposed_copper_trapdoor`, `weathered_copper_trapdoor`, `oxidized_copper_trapdoor`
    -   `tuff_stairs`
    -   `tuff_slab`
    -   `tuff_wall`
    -   `chiseled_tuff`
    -   `polished_tuff`
    -   `polished_tuff_stairs`
    -   `polished_tuff_slab`
    -   `polished_tuff_wall`
    -   `tuff_bricks`
    -   `tuff_brick_stairs`
    -   `tuff_brick_slab`
    -   `tuff_brick_wall`
    -   `chiseled_tuff_bricks`
-   Added unique sprites for the following blocks:
    -   `chiseled_copper`, `exposed_chiseled_copper`, `weathered_chiseled_copper`, `oxidized_chiseled_copper`
    -   `copper_grate`, `expxosed_copper_grate`, `weathered_copper_grate`, `oxidized_copper_grate`
    -   `copper_bulb`, `exposed_copper_bulb`, `weathered_copper_bulb`, `oxidized_copper_bulb`
    -   `copper_door`, `exposed_copper_door`, `weathered_copper_door`, `oxidized_copper_door`

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w42a

Hey! Today we bring you the first of the features we've shown you during Minecraft Live last weekend: the Crafter!

## Experimental Features

### Crafter

-   The Crafter is a new block that enables the crafting of items and blocks via Redstone
-   The Crafter will eject one crafted item at a time when powered by a new Redstone signal / pulse (not a continuous signal)
-   Upon receiving this new signal, the Crafter will eject the recipe result from the front face
-   If the output result has multiple type of items all the result items will be ejected together
-   The Crafter can be oriented in any direction when placed

**Crafter UI**

-   The Crafter has a 3x3 interactable crafting grid
-   The Crafter’s crafting grid slots are toggleable, meaning that the player can change the behavior of a slot by clicking or pressing on a slot with an empty hand
-   A slot that is ‘toggled’ cannot hold any items, and therefore cannot have items placed into it by other blocks, such as Hoppers and Droppers
-   Unlike the Crafting Table, the Crafter displays a preview of the crafted item which will be crafted and ejected on the next Redstone pulse but cannot be manually taken out by the player
-   The Crafter UI is shared between all players interacting with the Crafter, meaning that multiple players can interact with the Crafter at the same time, similar to Chests and Hoppers

**Crafter interaction with other blocks**

-   The Comparator signal strength is 0-9, where each non-empty or toggled slot adds 1 strength
-   Hoppers can be used to both insert and pull out items from the Crafter
-   Droppers can be used to insert items into the Crafter
-   Moving items in from another block (ex: Hopper, Dropper) prioritizes filling items into slots following these rules:
    -   Prioritize the first empty slot (from left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
    -   If there are no empty slots then prioritize the smallest stack of the same item (pick the first if there are multiple)
    -   If there is a toggled slot it will be skipped. The item will then be moved into the container
    -   If the item cannot be moved, it will be ejected into the world

We want to hear your feedback on the Crafter, so please let us know what you think the over in our dedicated [feedback thread](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/20459106029709-Let-s-talk-about-the-Crafter-).

## Changes

-   Added an accessibility option that allows to hide the yellow splash texts in the main menu
-   Added a recovery screen for worlds with missing data (for example, if saving failed due to an unexpected shutdown)

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 21
-   The Resource Pack version is now 19
-   Minor changes to chat component serialization

### Chat components

**Serialization**

-   The optional `type` field has a new allowed value: `selector`
-   Components of type `nbt` now have `source` field with allowed values `entity`, `block`, `storage`

## Data Pack Version 21

-   Introduced Jigsaw structure pool aliases, which can be used to rewire pool selection
-   Added field `block_state` to `tnt` entity to allow replacement of rendered block model
-   Renamed field `Fuse` to `fuse` on `tnt` entity
-   Added `playersNetherPortalDefaultDelay` and `playersNetherPortalCreativeDelay` gamerules to control time (in ticks) that a player needs to stand in a Nether portal before changing dimensions
-   Added new gamerule `projectilesCanBreakBlocks` to control whether impact projectiles will destroy blocks that are destructible by them, i.e. Chorus Flowers, Pointed Dripstone and Decorated Pots
-   Added `white_smoke` particle type

### Jigsaw pool aliases

-   Added optional `pool_aliases` list to Jigsaw structures
-   Aliases represent the possibility to rewire Jigsaw pool connections by redirecting pool references on individual structure instances
-   Alias variants are represented in `type` and is one of:
    -   `direct` 1:1 mapping from an alias to a new pool
        -   `alias` pool to replace
        -   `target` pool to replace with
    -   `random` 1:n mapping where a pool from `n` is randomly selected for the structure instance
        -   `alias` pool to replace
        -   `targets` randomized list of candidate pools to replace `alias` with
    -   `random_group`
        -   `groups` each group is a randomized list of above alias types
        -   only one group is selected per structure instance
        -   this enables modelling selections such as "if pool X is replaced with X1, also replace pool Y with Y1"

## Resource Pack Version 19

-   Added block model, item model and block state definitions for `crafter`
-   Added GUI container texture and sprites for `crafter`
-   Added `white_smoke` particle definition

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w41a

For this week's Snapshot, we've made improvements to the Decorated Pots!

Additionally, Realms is now available in Snapshots moving forward! Any player who has an active Realms subscription is eligible to create a free Snapshot Realm. This Snapshot Realm will be separate from your regular Realm to prevent any issues from impacting your regular Realm. For more information on how Snapshot Realms work, please see Realms in [Minecraft: Java Edition Snapshot FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/20143730191245).

## New Features

### Snapshot Realms

-   Realms is now available in Snapshots, Pre-Releases, and Release Candidates
-   The version of the last played world on a Realm is displayed in the Realms list
-   Experiments are available for newly created worlds

## Changes

-   Decorated Pots can now store items, and can be smashed by projectiles

### Decorated Pots

-   Decorated Pots now store up to a single stack of items
-   Hoppers, Hopper Minecarts and Droppers can now insert and/or extract items from Decorated Pots
-   Comparators can now read the number of items in Decorated Pots
-   Players can interact with Decorated Pots to insert items into them
-   Decorated Pots have no GUI, and need to be broken to retrieve or discover their content by players
-   Player interactions with Decorated Pots cause the Decorated Pot to wobble and trigger the vibration frequency of 11
-   Decorated Pots can be smashed by projectiles which cause them to shatter and drop their content
-   Decorated Pots now stack up to 64

We want to hear your feedback on these improvements to Decorated Pots - let us know what you think in [our dedicated feedback site post](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/20289952762637-Let-s-talk-about-Decorated-Pot-improvements-)!

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 20
-   The name of non-living entities will now be shown if looked at and a CustomName is set, or always displayed if CustomNameVisible is set, similar to living entities

## Data Pack Version 20

-   Changed `function` command results
-   Adjusted check for gamerule `maxCommandChainLength`
-   Added new gamerule `maxCommandForkCount`
-   Reintroduced form of the `execute` command: `execute if function`
-   Reintroduced form of the `return` command: `return run`
-   Decorated Pots with `cracked` state set to true will always shatter when broken
-   Added new `dust_plume` particle type

### Commands

**Functions**

-   `function` command has been changed to better accomodate new `return` command
-   Functions no longer have any result unless they use `return` or there was error during lookup or instantiation
    -   That means `function` command will no longer return (or even display) number of commands run during execution
    -   Error conditions:
        -   Calling non-existent function
        -   Calling empty function tag
        -   Macro instantiation failure
-   "Result" in this context means values that would be stored with `execute store`
-   The previous behavior where every command in function would perform store if a function was called with `execute store ... run function` is removed
    -   That means that a single call to `function` will store at most once (zero times if `return` was not called)
    -   For function tags with multiple entries, function results will be accumulated, but partial results will be stored at the end of every function

**Limits**

Existing limits for functions have been refined to accomodate new execution rules and prevent wider range of exploits:

-   Limits apply even if run from command line (so it will now always behave as if they were placed in a function)
    -   For example, all functions called by `execute as @e run function` will count towards same limit
    -   Executions from command blocks still count as separate ones
-   Limit `maxCommandChainLength` for functions will now count "operations" like:
    -   execution of command for a single context
    -   execution of a stage in `execute` (no matter how many contexts were modified)
    -   invocation of function
-   New limit with game rule `maxCommandForkCount` now restricts total amount of context that can be created by single state of functions like `execute`
    -   Example: if there are 5 entities in world, `execute as @e` creates 5 contexts, while `execute as @e at @e` creates 5;;*;;5 = 25 contexts

**`execute if function`**

An `execute` sub-command that runs a function or function tag and matches the return value(s). This is a reintroduction of functionality removed in previous version. If a tag is given, all functions run regardless of the results of prior functions.

Syntax: `execute if|unless function <function> <continuation>`

Parameters:

-   `function`: The function or tag to run

**Matching**

The matching of the result value of the function(s) that run:

-   At least one of the functions must succeed for the match to succeed
-   A succeessful call is defined as a function that:
    -   Uses the `return` command to return a value
    -   The return value is not 0
-   If no functions exited with `return`, neither `if` or `unless` will run

**`return run`**

A form of the `return` command is now available, `return run`. This is a reintroduction of functionality removed in previous version.

Syntax: `return run <command>`

This takes the `result` value from running the specified `command` and returns that as the return value of the function.

-   If command did not return any value (like, for example, call to a `function` without `return`), return will not execute and function will continue execution
-   If the given command fails, the return value is `0`
-   In all other aspects, it works like `return` with a specified return value
-   In case of fork (for example `return run execute as @e run some_command`) the first execution of the command will return
    -   If there are no executions (for example in `return run execute if @e[something_impossible] run some_command`) function will not return and will continue execution

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w40a

We are now releasing Snapshot 23w40a, the first snapshot for 1.20.3! This snapshot contains improvements for shields, changes to chat component serialization and bug fixes.

## Changes

-   When a player is blocking with a shield, the arm with the shield now follows the direction the player is looking at, when viewed from third person perspective

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 19
-   A few minor changes to chat component serialization

### Chat components

**Serialization**

-   Plain-text chat components (text, no sibilings, no stylings) are now always serialized as string instead of `{"text': "blah"}`
-   Chat components now serialize to NBT when sent over network
-   Chat components now have an optional `type` value (allowed values: `text`, `translatable`, `score`, `nbt`, `keybind`) to speed up parsing and improve error checking
-   `id` field in `show_entity` `hoverEvent` style now also accepts UUID as an array of 4 ints
-   Numeric and boolean arguments for `translate` component are no longer converted to string
-   The following JSON component representations are no longer accepted:
    -   `null`
    -   `[]`
-   Errors in following style fields are no longer silently ignored:
    -   `color`
    -   `clickEvent`
    -   `hoverEvent`
    -   `hoverEvent[action=show_entity].contents.name`
    -   `hoverEvent[action=show_item].contents.tag`

## Data Pack Version 19

### Tags

-   Added `can_breathe_under_water` entity type tag which disables drowning
-   Added `can_break_armor_stands` damage type tag for damage types that can incrementally knock down armor stands
