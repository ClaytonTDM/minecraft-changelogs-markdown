# Minecraft Snapshot 23w12a

Well hello fellow Minecraft lovers! It is time for the first snapshot for 1.20. We know we promised no more major features, so how did we end up with such a big snapshot? You thought the trails were over? NO! In snapshot 23w12a we have even more tales to tell! Our devs apparently could not resist throwing in a few extra additions. Enjoy!

## New Features

-   All features and changes from the "Update 1.20" experimental pack are now part of the game
-   Vibration resonance functionality has been added to Blocks of Amethyst
-   Added the Calibrated Sculk Sensor block
-   Added Suspicious Gravel, more Archaeology sites, and new Pottery Shards
-   Added 5 new armor trims
-   Signs have improved customization options
-   Added Sniffer Egg
-   Added Pitcher Plant

### Vibration Resonance

-   Blocks of Amethyst have a new behavior when placed adjacent to Sculk Sensors
    -   If that Sculk Sensor receives a vibration, the Block of Amethyst will re-emit its frequency as a separate vibration at its location
-   This behaviour is called Vibration Resonance, and allows players to move vibration frequencies across long distances without having to recreate the vibration naturally

### Calibrated Sculk Sensors

-   A new variant of Sculk Sensors which allows you to filter vibrations based on their frequency level
-   They are not found naturally and can only be crafted with 1 Sculk Sensor and 3 Amethyst Shards in the Crafting Table
-   One side of the Calibrated Sculk Sensor can receive a redstone signal as input
    -   The strength of that redstone signal is the only vibration frequency the Sculk Sensor will listen to

### Archaeology

-   Added Suspicious Gravel block
    -   It has the same characteristics as Suspicious Sand
-   Added Suspicious Gravel to Cold Ocean Ruins
-   Added Suspicious Sand to Warm Ocean Ruins
    -   Sniffer Eggs can be found here
-   Added the Trail Ruins, a buried structure from a lost culture
    -   Four Armor trims can be found here
-   Added 16 Pottery Shards (so there are now 20 Pottery Shards in total)
    -   These have been distributed between the 5 Archaeology sites: Desert Wells, Desert Temples, Cold Ocean Ruins, Warm Ocean Ruins, and Trail Ruins

### Armor Trims

New armor trim Smithing Templates have been added to the following structures:

-   Trail Ruins
    -   Wayfinder Armor Trim
    -   Raiser Armor Trim
    -   Shaper Armor Trim
    -   Host Armor Trim
-   Ancient City
    -   Silence Armor Trim

### Signs

-   Sign text can now be edited after being placed in the world
    -   This can be done by interacting with the Sign
-   Both sides of the Sign can now have separate text and colors, allowing for further customization options
    -   By default, a Sign will prompt you to input the front side's text when placed
    -   To apply text to the back-side, you must walk to the other side and interact with that face to edit it
-   Signs can now also be waxed with Honeycomb, preventing any further edits to its text
    -   Click commands on Signs can only be invoked when the Sign is waxed
    -   If a Sign with a click command is not waxed, interacting with it will not invoke the command and instead open up the edit screen as usual

### Sniffer Egg

-   Can be found in the Suspicious Sand of Warm Ocean Ruins
-   When two Sniffers breed they do not immediately spawn a Snifflet; instead, a Sniffer Egg is dropped
-   Hatching
    -   When placed on Moss, the Egg will hatch after approximately 10 minutes
    -   On all other blocks, it will hatch in approximately 20 minutes

### Pitcher Plant

-   The Sniffer can now occasionally Sniff up a Pitcher Pod item
    -   This Pod, when planted in Farmland, grows into a Pitcher Crop, which has five growth stages
    -   Once fully grown, the Pitcher Crop can be harvested, yielding a two-block-tall Pitcher Plant

## Changes

-   Vibration frequencies of many actions in the game have been tweaked
-   Wither effect particle color has been adjusted to make it more distinguishable
-   Potion of Slow Falling color has been adjusted to make it more distinguishable
-   Step sounds can now combine for blocks walked through and stepped on

### Vibration Frequencies

In preparation for the Calibrated Sculk Sensor, vibration frequencies have been greatly simplified to prevent unwanted interference. The following are category descriptions for each frequency and the expected events that they correspond to:

1.  Movement in any medium (land, water and air)
2.  Landing on any surface (land or water)
3.  Item interactions
4.  Gliding with an elytra or unique mob actions (Ravager roar, Wolf shaking, etc)
5.  Dismounting a mob or equipping gear
6.  Mounting a mob or interacting with a mob
7.  Mobs and players getting damaged
8.  Consuming items (drinking and eating)
9.  Blocks 'deactivating' (door close, chest close, button unpress, etc)
10.  Blocks 'activating' (door open, chest open, button press, etc)
11.  Blocks changing (cauldron water level rising, adding food to campfire, etc)
12.  Blocks being destroyed
13.  Blocks being placed
14.  Mobs and players teleporting or spawning
15.  Mobs and players dying or an explosion

### Combination Step Sounds

-   Combines two different step sounds
-   Occurs for carpets, snow, nether sprouts, as well as warped and crimson roots
    -   The top-most block you are walking on is played as normal
    -   The block underneath is played at a lower volume and pitch

### Armor Trims

-   The Dune Armor Trim now has a brand-new pattern and Smithing Template icon
-   The Dune Armor Trim's old pattern is now used by the Sentry Armor Trim
    -   A new icon has been made for the Sentry Armor Trim Smithing Template to fit this pattern
-   The Sentry Armor Trim's old pattern is now used by the new Shaper Armor Trim

## Technical Changes

-   The data pack version is now 13, accounting for sign data format changes
-   Added a `capped` rule structure processor that limits the number of replaced blocks for a structure piece to a configured maximum
-   Configuring block entity fields in a `rule` processor rule is now delegated to a referenced `block_entity_modifier` instead of the previously fixed `output_nbt` configuration
-   Game events have changed vibration frequency and some have been removed
-   Tweaked display entity interpolation
-   Removed `update_1_20` feature flag and built-in datapack - features are no longer experimental

### Structure post-processors

**Capped post-processor**

-   A `capped` post-processor has been added which can limit how many blocks a delegated post-processor randomly transform in a structure
-   This can be used to configure a structure piece to have an exact amount of specific blocks, instead of using random distribution
-   The `capped` post-processor has following required parameters:
    -   `delegate` A post-processor which performs the actual block transformation
    -   `limit` Maximum amount of blocks that the delegated post-processor can transform
        -   The blocks inside a structure are all randomly passed to the delegated post-processor until it has transformed the limited amount
        -   Either constant or random number generator sampled during post-processing

**Rule post-processor block entity configuration**

-   Previously a rule could specify an optional fixed `output_nbt` which would be added to the processed output block entity
-   This field has now been changed to reference a `block_entity_modifier`
-   Existing `block_entity_modifier`'s are:
    -   `passthrough` Retains existing fields on the block entity
        -   This is the default if no `block_entity_modifier` is specified
    -   `append_static` Similar to previous `output_nbt` this provides fixed fields to add to the block entity
        -   A minor change is that this modifier appends configured fields to the processed block instead of replacing existing fields
    -   `clear` Removes any existing fields on the block entity
    -   `append_loot` Appends a loot table and seed to the block entity through required parameter:
        -   `loot_table` Referenced loot table to add to block entity as `LootTable` field
        -   Field `LootTableSeed` is also added to the block entity using random seeded by block position

### Game Events

-   `piston_contract` game event has been removed in favor of `block_deactivate`
-   `piston_extend` and `dispense_fail` game events have been removed in favor of `block_activate`
-   Many game events have new vibration frequencies:
    -   1: `step`, `swim`, `flap`
    -   2: `projectile_land`, `hit_ground`, `splash`
    -   3: `item_interact_finish`, `projectile_shoot`, `instrument_play`
    -   4: `entity_roar`, `entity_shake`, `elytra_glide`
    -   5: `entity_dismount`, `equip`
    -   6: `entity_mount`, `entity_interact`, `shear`
    -   7: `entity_damage`
    -   8: `drink`, `eat`
    -   9: `container_close`, `block_close`, `block_deactivate`, `block_detach`
    -   10: `container_open`, `block_open`, `block_activate`, `block_attach`, `prime_fuse`, `note_block_play`
    -   11: `block_change`
    -   12: `block_destroy`, `fluid_pickup`
    -   13: `block_place`, `fluid_place`
    -   14: `entity_place`, `lightning_strike`, `teleport`
    -   15: `entity_die`, `explode`

### Tags

**Step Sounds**

-   The blocks that can produce a combination of step sounds is controlled by `combination_step_sound_blocks`

### Display entity

**Interpolation changes**

-   Previous values are always discarded if `interpolation_duration` is `0`
-   Made sure that render properties are applied at the same time (so `block_state` is applied at the same time as transformation, i.e. at next tick after receiving update)
-   Entities are not rendered unless initial data is received. That means display entities might not show on the first tick.
-   Note: due to how game handles updates, changes to entities made after summoning might be delivered to clients with later tick

# Minecraft 1.19.4 Release Candidate 1

Here is the first (and hopefully last) release candidate for 1.19.4. Unless something critical pops up, no further changes will be made for the full release, which is planned for next week.

Happy mining!

## Technical Changes

Changes to display entity interpolation:

-   interpolation always starts at the beginning on client tick
-   field `interpolation_start` is replaced with `start_interpolation`, with a different meaning
-   `start_interpolation` describes amount of ticks from the start of next client tick after receiving an update to start of interpolation
    -   for example value `0` means that interpolation will start at the beginning of next client tick after receiving the update
-   `start_interpolation` is not stored in entity data
    -   when using data commands, if interpolated value is updated, but `start_interpolation` is not present in modified tag, interpolation will continue from the time of previous update, but with new values

## Fixed bugs in 1.19.4-rc1

-   [MC-260857](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-260857) Display entities summoned with initial transformation interpolate incorrectly from default transformation during next transformation

# Minecraft 1.19.4 Pre-Release 2

We are now releasing the second pre-release for Minecraft 1.19.4. This pre-release contains bug fixes, as well as an updated model for the decorated pot.

As a reminder, the pre-release cycle for 1.19.4 will continue to contain mostly bug fixes.

Happy mining!

## Technical Changes

# Minecraft 1.19.4 Pre-Release 1

We are now releasing the first pre-release for Minecraft 1.19.4. This pre-release contains a new high contrast accessibility setting, some updates to the Create World tab visuals, a new execute subcommand, improvements to startup performance, and lots of bug fixes!

For the remainder of the 1.19.4 cycle, you should mostly see bugs being fixed. In addition to that, pre-releases don't follow the regular snapshot cadence of releasing on Wednesdays, so keep an eye out for the next pre-release.

Happy mining!

## Important Note

-   Experimental 1.20 worlds created in the previous snapshot (23w07a) can no longer be opened in this version

## Changes

-   The enchantment glint for items in the inventory has been made more visible
-   The default value of the "Glint Strength" setting has been reduced to 75%
-   Potions no longer have an enchantment glint due to it obscuring the color of the potion contents
-   Added a notification system for Realms to tell you about important information about your Realm

### Accessibility

-   Added a built-in resource pack that enhances the contrast of UI elements
    -   The resource pack can be enabled in the Accessibility Options screen or manually in the Resource Pack screen
    -   This is only available in the menus for now, but we’ll be looking to bring this to gameplay UIs in the future as well

### Updated Create New World Screen

-   The appearance of the tab bar in the Create New World screen has been updated
    -   Tabs now have unique visuals instead of being traditional buttons
    -   The tabs now align to the center of the screen
    -   The content has been aligned to the top of the screen

## Technical Changes

-   The resource pack version is now 13
-   Changed the following game events:
    -   `item_interact_finish` now has a vibration frequency of 2 instead of 14
-   New Damage Type Tag: `bypasses_cooldown` - damage types with this tag bypass the regular invincibility time after taking damage
-   New Entity Type Tag: `fall_damage_immune` - entity types with this tag do not take fall damage

### Resource Pack format

-   The enchantment glint now has two separate texture files: `enchanted_glint_entity.png` and `enchanted_glint_item.png`

### Commands

**`execute positioned over`**

New `execute` sub-command for finding positions on top of a heightmap. Changes the height of the execution position to be on top of the given heightmap. Syntax:

-   `execute positioned over <heightmap>`

**Heightmaps**

A heightmap records the highest position in a column of blocks according to some criteria. Available options:

-   `world_surface`: Any non-air block
-   `motion_blocking`: Any motion blocking material (e.g. ignores flowers and grass)
-   `motion_blocking_no_leaves`: Any non-leaf motion blocking material
-   `ocean_floor`: Any non-fluid motion blocking material

## Changes for Experimental Features

-   The Brush crafting recipe now uses a Feather, Copper Ingot and Stick in a vertical line
-   The Sniffer Spawn Egg colors have been updated
-   The recipe for the Decorated Pot made of all Bricks can now be found in the Recipe Book
