# Minecraft: Java Edition 1.16.4

It's time for the 1.16.4 release! This release adds the new social interactions screen and fixes a few crashes.

If you missed it, we recently announced that Mojang accounts will be migrating into Microsoft accounts. This release prepares for that by having the game understand the settings and block-list of Microsoft accounts. You can read more about it over [here](https://www.minecraft.net/article/java-edition-moving-house), and you can find answers to questions you might have in the [FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360050865492), which will be continuously updated.

## Features in 1.16.4

-   New UI called Social Interactions Screen
-   A button to open a link to the Accessibility Guide can now be found in the Accessibility Options screen

### Social Interactions Screen

A new screen available in Multiplayer which shows a list of all players on a server so you can hide chat from any player.

-   Opens with a configurable key binding, by default P
-   Which players are hidden resets when you disconnect from a server

### Blocked Players

-   When logging in with a Microsoft account, players blocked in your account are now also blocked in the game, and account restrictions are now respected
-   Chat from blocked players is always hidden
-   Realms invites from blocked players are hidden
