# Minecraft 1.18 Pre-Release 2

The second pre-release for Minecraft Java is now available. In this pre-release, we've upgraded the Java version that is bundled with the game, and the game now uses Java 17. Other than this, we've mostly been busy fixing bugs.

Enjoy!

## Technical Changes in 1.18 Pre-Release 2

Minecraft now uses Java version 17. If you are using a default setup the Launcher will download and install the correct version. If you are using a custom Java setup or a third-party launcher, you will need to ensure that your Java installation is version 17 or above.

# Minecraft 1.18 Pre-Release 1

The first 1.18 pre-release is here!

From now on, you should mostly see bugs being fixed. In addition to that, pre-releases don't follow the regular snapshot cadence of releasing on Wednesdays, so keep an eye out!

That being said, this pre-release introduces biome blending, which means that you should no longer find harsh borders between new and old terrain. On top of that, we've also reintroduced the Amplified and Large Biome world types.

Happy mining!

## Changes in 1.18 Pre-Release 1

-   Amplified and Large biome worlds have been adapted to the new terrain and are now once again available in the Create World screen
-   Removed world types "Caves" and "Floating islands" from the world creation screen
-   The transition between new and old terrain is less "cliffy"
    -   Will surface height blend? Yes
    -   Will biomes blend? Yes
    -   Will caves blend? Your mileage may vary

## Technical changes in 1.17 Pre-release 1

-   Added `started_riding`, `lightning_strike` and `using_item` advancement triggers
-   Added `source` condition to `effects_changed` trigger
-   Added `lightning_bolt` sub-predicate
-   Added `passenger`, `stepping_on` and `lightning_bolt` properties to entity predicate
-   Added `looking_at` condition to player sub-predicate
-   Expanded `item` field on item predicate to `items`
-   Expanded `block` field on block predicate to `blocks`
-   Added F3+L shortcut to generate and persist performance metrics from in-game
    -   F3+L on single-player worlds will also include reports for the integrated server
-   Removed debug report command (use perf start/stop for server performance measurement)
-   perf start/stop command on dedicated servers will now generate and persist server performance metrics

### Advancements

**New triggers**

**`started_riding`**

-   Triggered when player starts riding a vehicle or entity starts riding vehicle currently ridden by player
-   Conditions:
    -   `player` - either a player that started riding or one of boat passengers

**`lightning_strike`**

-   Triggered when lighting finishes (i.e. entity disappears)
-   Triggers for any player on server
-   Conditions
    -   `player` - player for which this trigger runs
    -   `lightning` - predicate for lightning entity
    -   `bystander` - predicate for one of the entities in certain area around strike not hurt by it

**`using_item`**

-   Triggered for every tick of using items (like crossbows, spyglass, fishing rods, etc)
-   Conditions
    -   `player` - players that uses item
    -   `item` - item being used

**Changed triggers**

**`effects_changed`**

-   Added `source` triggers that matches entity that triggered the change
-   Might be empty when:
    -   there is no entity (for example, effect gained from beacon)
    -   the effect is self-applied
    -   effect is removed

**Changed predicates**

**Item predicate**

-   `item` field expended to `items`, now accepting array of item types

**Block predicate**

-   `block` field expended to `blocks`, now accepting array of block types

**Entity predicate**

-   `passenger` - new sub-predicate for passenger directly riding this vehicle (if present, must match one or more)
-   `stepping_on` - location predicate for block entity is currently standing on
-   `lightning_bolt` - sub-predicate valid only for lightning bolt entity

**Player predicate**

-   `looking_at` - entity currently viewed by player
    -   uses same line-of-sight rules as attacking mobs
    -   actual detection radius might be changed in future

**Lightning bolt**

-   `blocks_set_on_fire` - range check for of blocks set on fire by this entity
-   `entity_struck` - predicate for entities struck by this lightning (if present, must match one or more)

### Performance metrics reporting

These will be saved to a zip file in `debug/profiling/<yyyy-MM-dd_HH.mm.ss-[levelname]-[version]>.zip` and could be used for performance regression analysis if included in bug reports.

The exact metrics, output format, and names are susceptible to change between versions. Our plan is to continue iterating on which metrics to capture.

**Client F3+L shortcut**

Pressing F3+L while in the game will start a recording for 10 seconds capturing metrics such as tick durations, used heap sizes and other more detailed stats.

Pressing F3+L before the 10-second limit will end the recording early.

This shortcut is always available to clients, even on multi-player servers where it will record client-side performance.

**Dedicated Server perf start/stop command**

`perf start` will start a recording for 10 seconds capturing metrics such as tick durations, used heap sizes and other more detailed stats.

`perf stop` before the 10-second limit will end the recording early.
