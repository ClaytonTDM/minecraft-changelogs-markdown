# Minecraft 1.19 Pre-Release 2

A recent change made it possible for more types of mobs to spawn inside Nether Portals, which caused them to instantly change dimensions after spawning. We will not be making any further changes to this before the release of 1.19, but our intent for the future is to prevent most mobs from spawning in Nether Portals and the ones that do will not immediately travel through the portal. Expect to see these changes in a coming version.

## Changes in 1.19 Pre-release 2

​

-   If the Warden is stuck in a liquid, it will angrily despawn instead of digging
-   Reverted using `generic equip` sound when equipping blocks in the head slot

## Technical Changes in 1.19 Pre-release 2

-   Added game event `teleport` with a vibration frequency of 5

# Minecraft Snapshot 22w19a

Thursday snapshot! Apart from some bugfixes and some changes to fancy tags and commands, we're introducing "chat preview" as a way to cryptographically sign chat messages that have been dynamically styled by servers. And for this snapshot only, we've left in our testing option `test-rainbow-chat` in `server.properties`, which can be set to true together with the new `previews-chat` option for testing. If this is something that interests you, and especially if you run a server, we would love your feedback on it.

Enjoy!

## Changes in 22w19a

-   Warden and Iron Golems now make sure to spawn above something solid

## Technical Changes in 22w19a

-   Servers can now enable Chat Preview, which displays a server-controlled preview above the chat edit box
-   Changes to the locate and place commands
-   Point of Interest tags

### Chat Preview

-   Servers can enable Chat Preview by setting `previews-chat=true` in `server.properties`
-   When enabled, a server-controlled preview appears above the chat edit box, showing how the message will look when sent
-   This can be used by servers to preview messages with styling applied, such as emojis or chat coloring
-   Chat Preview sends chat messages to the server as they are typed, even before they're sent
    -   The server then sends back the styled preview in real time
    -   This allows servers to apply dynamic message stylings while still allowing chat to be securely signed
-   A warning screen is shown on the client when joining a server with Chat Preview, and it can be globally disabled in Chat Settings
-   Dynamic chat styling can also be controlled by the server, although this is only signed when Chat Preview is enabled
    -   Clients can prefer to always show the original, signed message by enabling "Only Show Signed Chat" in Chat Settings

### Commands

-   Added template sub-command to `place`;;-;;command
-   `locate` command moved to `locate structure`, `locatebiome` moved to `locate biome`
-   Added `locate poi <type: point_of_interest_type>`
-   Servers will now also send an additional icon and MOTD packet after a player has connected
    -   This allows servers with `enable-status=false` to set an icon and MOTD for players that successfully connect

**Place template**

The `place`;;-;;command can now also place templates at a given location. Syntax: `place template <template> [pos] [rotation] [mirror] [integrity] [seed]`

-   `place template` works like using the load button in the UI for a structure block

Parameters:

-   `template`: The namespaced id of a template ("structure block file") to load and place
-   `rotation`: The rotation to apply (if omitted, `none` is used)
-   `mirror`: The mirroring to apply (if omitted, `none` is used)
-   `integrity`: The structure integrity value between 0 and 1
-   `seed`: The seed to use for the randomized degradation when integrity is less than 1

### Point of Interest types

-   Removed `unemployed` and `nitwit` `point_of_interest_type`s
-   Added tag `point_of_interest_type/acquirable_job_site` for all job sites seeked by Villagers with `none` profession
-   Added tag `point_of_interest_type/village` for PoI that are part of Village
-   Added tag `point_of_interest_type/bee_home` for all PoI targeted by Bees

# Minecraft Snapshot 22w18a

Another snapshot is now available for Minecraft: Java Edition. This snapshot brings a few gameplay changes and some technical tidbits, such as the place command and cryptographically signed chat commands.

Enjoy!

## Changes in 22w18a

-   Allays now follow their liked player even if they can't see them
-   Allays will only lose track of a player if they are more than 64 blocks away
-   The texture of the sonic boom particle has been updated
-   Vibration listeners such as Sculk Sensors, Sculk Shriekers and Wardens now listen to the closest vibration instead of the first vibration in the tick

## Technical Changes in 22w18a

-   Banner patterns available in the Loom can now be controlled with tags (`banner_pattern/no_item_required` for no pattern item and `banner_pattern/pattern_item/*` for specific banner pattern items)
-   Servers can now define different chat style formats for clients
-   Removed the `placefeature` command
-   Added the `place` command

### Chat Types

-   Different chat style formats can now be controlled by the server through the `chat_type` registry
    -   These are synchronized to clients when they join the server

        -   Chat can be similarly optionally narrated with a custom translation key or format

    place feature <feature> [pos]
    place jigsaw <pool> <start> <depth> [pos]
    place structure <structure> [pos]
    

Parameters:

-   `feature`: The namespaced id of a feature to try to place
-   `structure`: The namespaced id of a structure to try to generate
-   `pool`: The namespaced id of a template pool to start generating
-   `start`: The namespaced id name of a jigsaw to use as the starting anchor
-   `depth`: The maximum number of jigsaw connections to traverse during placement
-   `pos`: The position to use as the origin for the generation (if omitted, `~ ~ ~` is used)

# Minecraft Snapshot 22w17a

Prepare to drop some sick bleats in the latest Minecraft: Java Edition snapshot! We're bringing in the sweet sounds of the goat horn. There are also some changes to the warden and the allay.

If the technical aspects of chatting is where it's at for you, make sure to check out the changes to chat signing.

Enjoy!

## New Features in 22w17a

-   Added Goat Horn!

### Goat Horn

-   A Goat Horn drops when a Goat rams a tree or any other hard block that occurs naturally where Goats spawn (Logs, Stone, Packed Ice, Iron Ore, copper Ore, or Emerald Ore)
    -   Other solid blocks are unfamiliar to the Goat, so it won't ram them
-   Use the horn to play a loud sound that can be heard from afar
-   Each horn has its own sound based on the Goat it originated from
-   There are 8 Goat Horn variants, 4 of them exclusive to screaming Goats
-   Goat Horns can sometimes be found in Pillager Outposts

## Changes in 22w17a

-   The Allay connecting with Note Blocks is now better visualized by the vibration particle
-   The Allay connecting with Note Blocks can now be blocked by Wool Blocks again
-   Replaced realms subtle selected world highlight with a clear green checkmark
-   Updated the Brewing Stand's base UVs and texture to match a graphical fix in Bedrock Edition
-   Explosions caused by player-ignited TNT now cause experience to drop from broken blocks (such as ore blocks and sculk)
    -   We will be keeping an eye on feedback for this change, it might change in a future update
-   Sculk blocks now have very low blast resistance
-   Warden balancing

### Warden

-   Their ranged attack will now:
    -   Bypass shields and armor
    -   Deal 10 damage instead of 30 damage, and the cooldown has been reduced from 5 seconds to 2 seconds
    -   Display a custom death message
-   Wardens now drop a single Sculk Catalyst upon death

## Technical Changes in 22w17a

-   Signed Chat
-   Removed `dampenable_vibrations` game event tag

### Multiplayer Secure Chat Signing

This is the first step in a process to provide more security and player safety features for in-game chat. We'd love to hear your thoughts, but keep in mind that many features such as server-driven styling of chat messages are still missing.

-   Chat messages between players are now cryptographically signed
-   Players are given a Mojang provided key-pair on startup
-   Servers can require players to have a Mojang-signed public key by setting `enforce-secure-profile=true` in `server.properties`
    -   Enforcing secure profiles will prevent players without a Mojang-signed public key from connecting
    -   By default this is set to `false`, allowing players to connect without a Mojang-signed public key
-   Chat styling is now handled via server resource packs with the translation key `chat.type.text`
