# 21w42a

It's time for a musical snapshot! We're now introducing new music for Caves & Cliffs: Part II. This time around we have a bunch of new tracks composed by the talented Lena Raine and Kumi Tanioka. These tracks are also available on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/7yQIrNTf3pBu0FdyAJqTqb?si=CC31NZyIQrOl-MNVCNYYkQ) for you to listen to, and they will soon be available on other services such as Apple Music and YouTube as well.

This snapshot also includes a few additional tweaks, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

**We still highly recommend backing up your world before loading it in this snapshot.**
