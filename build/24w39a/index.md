# Data Pack Version 55

-   `boat` and `chest_boat` entity types have been split into separate types, one per existing variant

## Boat split

-   Variants of boats and chest boats now have separate entity type instead of `Type` field
-   Removed entites:
    -   `minecraft:boat`
    -   `minecraft:chest_boat`
-   New entities:
    -   Boat without chest:
        -   `Type=oak` -> `minecraft:oak_boat`
        -   `Type=spruce` -> `minecraft:spruce_boat`
        -   `Type=birch` -> `minecraft:birch_boat`
        -   `Type=jungle` -> `minecraft:jungle_boat`
        -   `Type=acacia` -> `minecraft:acacia_boat`
        -   `Type=cherry` -> `minecraft:cherry_boat`
        -   `Type=dark_oak` -> `minecraft:dark_oak_boat`
        -   `Type=mangrove` -> `minecraft:mangrove_boat`
        -   `Type=bamboo` -> `minecraft:bamboo_raft`
    -   Boat with chest:
        -   `Type=oak` -> `minecraft:oak_chest_boat`
        -   `Type=spruce` -> `minecraft:spruce_chest_boat`
        -   `Type=birch` -> `minecraft:birch_chest_boat`
        -   `Type=jungle` -> `minecraft:jungle_chest_boat`
        -   `Type=acacia` -> `minecraft:acacia_chest_boat`
        -   `Type=cherry` -> `minecraft:cherry_chest_boat`
        -   `Type=dark_oak` -> `minecraft:dark_oak_chest_boat`
        -   `Type=mangrove` -> `minecraft:mangrove_chest_boat`
        -   `Type=bamboo` -> `minecraft:bamboo_chest_raft`

## Container Locks

-   The `Lock` field of containers has been renamed to `lock` and is now an item predicate
    -   Any items which match the predicate can open the container
-   The `lock` data component is now also an item predicate

## Tags

### Item Tags

-   `map_invisibility_equipment`: Items that can be equipped to hide the player marker on other players maps

## Predicates

-   `minecraft:boat` entity sub-predicate has been removed, since boats no longer have variants
