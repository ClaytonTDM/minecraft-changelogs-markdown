# Minecraft Snapshot 20w30a

Today we're releasing Snapshot 20w30a for Minecraft Java Edition in which we've tweaked Bastion Remnants, and given you the ability to have lanterns under water.

## Changes in 20w30a

-   Modified how respawn positions are chosen for beds and respawn anchors
-   Lanterns can now be waterlogged
-   Soul Lanterns can now be waterlogged
-   Tweaked the Bastion Remnant chest loot
-   Chests in Bastion Remnants are now more likely to be located on top of gilded blackstone

### Respawn Block Positions

-   Respawn anchors will prioritize cardinal directions over corners
-   Beds will prioritize the side of the bed the player entered from and then spaces circling around the foot of the bed up to the head of the bed
-   Respawning players will now face the block that they respawned at
-   Placing players onto dangerous blocks is now avoided when possible

## Technical Changes in 20w30a

-   The sign edit screen will now intialize from existing sign text (should have no noticeable impact on vanilla)
-   Tags can now have optional entries

### Optional Tag Entries

Entries in tags can now be marked as optional. Failure to resolve optional entries does not prevent the whole tag from loading.

Example:

    {
      "replace": false,
      "values": [
        "#minecraft:beds", // existing syntax
        { "id":"#missing:tag", "required": false }, // optional sub-tag entry
    "minecraft:anvil", // existing syntax
    { "id":"minecraft:stone_button", "required": true }, // new syntax for required tags
    { "id":"missing:block", "required": false } // optional single-element entry

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w28a

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w22a

It has been a busy week for us but we still wanted to squeeze out a snapshot as we've been busy squashing a bunch of bugs.

## Experimental Rendering Changes

We've included some experimental changes to graphics rendering in this snapshot, which might reveal some issues on a small number of older graphics cards.

If do you find any new graphical bugs then please report them to the bug tracker with the make and model of your graphics card as well as which operating system you are using ​

### Villager Workstation Logic

​

-   Villagers now have to walk to and reach the workstation before they can acquire the profession / work there

​

### Datapack loading

​

-   If existing datapacks prevent world from loading, game will give option to load world in safe mode, which loads only vanilla datapack
-   Changes to datapack list are stored only after successful reload
-   Added `--safeMode` option to server to load only with vanilla datapack
-   Game will now detect critical datapack issues, like missing required tags and prevent world from being loaded

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w21a

In this snapshot, we're adding support for custom world settings and custom dimensions. This is an early release to hear your feedback about this feature - do note that this support is considered experimental and unsupported. Any custom world settings may change from one snapshot to the next, and worlds using custom settings will be clearly marked as experimental in your worlds list. ​

## New Features in 20w21a

​

-   Added the ability to toggle redstone wire between a cross and a dot
-   Added import/export world settings functionality
-   Added a new disableMultiplayer command line option - when used, the Multiplayer button is disabled
-   Added a new disableChat command line option - when used, receiving and sending online chat is disabled

​

### Redstone Toggle

​

-   When right clicking a single piece of redstone, it toggles between a the cross and the dot
-   A dot of redstone will not power its surrounding blocks

​

## Changes in 20w21a

​

-   Piglins no longer walk around when admiring gold
-   If you hurt a piglin while it is admiring an ingot, the ingot will now disappear
-   Increased the chance of ores to generate in the Basalt Deltas to balance against the reduced amount of Netherrack in this biome
-   Lily pads are now considered junk fishing loot rather than treasure
-   Updated logos for Mojang Studios and Minecraft
-   Temporarily removed structure settings from flat level preset strings (workaround: use import/export settings functionality)

​

## Technical Changes in 20w21a

​

-   Added the ability to control the height of the `spreadplayers` command
-   Added custom worlds and custom dimensions

​

### Commands

​

#### `spreadplayers`

​ Added an optional argument to specify maximum height. New syntax: `spreadplayers <center> <spreadDistance> <maxRange> [under <maxHeight>] <respectTeams> <targets>` ​

-   `maxHeight` - Specifies the maximum height for resulting positions

​

#### `locate`

​

-   Structure names are now specified as lowercase

​

### Custom Worlds

​

-   Added experimental support for new custom worlds
-   Edit world screen now has an option to export world settings to a JSON file
-   During world creation you can import previously exported world settings
-   A bunch of new parameters are exposed, but marked as experimental, meaning you can play with them, but there is no guarantee that any of them will continue working (even in the next snapshot!)
-   Flat level preset string lost structure settings (they are now stored in a common format for all worlds), we will restore some form of this functionality soon
-   Buffet world can no longer be created from server.properties, flat level settings changed a bit; better support for custom world creation on the server is coming soon

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w20b

This week we are releasing a bit of a smaller snapshot. However, if you're into switching game modes and completing advancements, this is right up your alley!

**Edit:** We've now released 20w20b to fix a bug

## Fixed Bug in 20w20b

-   [MC-183769](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-183769) NPE in server initialization

## New Features in 20w20a

-   Added new Game Mode Switcher debug menu
-   Added new Nether Advancements

​

### Game Mode Switcher

New F3 debug feature which allows you to switch game modes with traditional "tabbing" functionality. ​

-   Hold F3 and tap F4 to open the menu
-   Tapping F4 will cycle the game mode, or you can use the mouse
-   Release F3 to apply
-   Your last game mode is remembered and will be the first selected option, so you can quickly toggle between two game modes with a single press of F3 + F4!

​

#### F3 + N (Toggle Spectator)

A small change has been made to this debug combination. ​

-   By default, using this key would return to Creative after toggling from Spectator. It now will toggle back to the previous game mode you had.
-   As an example, if you were in Survival, then toggled to Spectator and back, you would be set back to Survival.

​

### New Advancements

-   `Those Were the Days` unlocks when entering a Bastion
-   `War Pigs` unlocks when looting a chest in a Bastion
-   `Oh Shiny` unlocks when distracting an angry Piglin with gold

​

## Changes in 20w20a

-   The `Bullseye` advancement now unlocks when hitting the bullseye of a target block from at least 30 meters away
-   The `Serious Dedication` advancement is now awarded for obtaining a Netherite Hoe
-   Obtaining Blackstone now also counts for the `Stone Age` advancement
-   Breeding Striders now counts for `The Parrots and the Bats` and is now required for `Two by Two`

​

## Technical Changes in 20w20a

-   Shulkers with "NoAI" can now be summoned with rotation.
-   Added `thrown_item_picked_up_by_entity` advancement trigger
-   Added `player_generates_container_loot` advancement trigger
-   Added `item_used_on_block` advancement trigger
-   Removed `safely_harvest_honey` advancement trigger

​

### Advancements

#### `item_used_on_block` trigger type

Properties:

-   `item` matches the thrown item which was picked up
-   `entity` matches the entity which picked up the item

​

#### `player_generates_container_loot` trigger type

Properties:

-   `loot_table` matches the resource location of the generated loot table

​

#### `item_used_on_block` trigger type

Properties:

-   `location` matches the location at the center of the block the item was used on
-   `item` matches the item used on the block

​

### Miscellaneous trigger changes

-   `location` got a new property `smokey` which checks if the location is closely above a campfire
-   `entity_properties` got new properties `vehicle` and `targetedEntity` which match the vehicle or the entity targeted by a mob
