## Deepslate

-   Grimstone is now called Deepslate
-   Deepslate now has a top texture, and a new block called Cobbled Deepslate drops from Deepslate
-   The cobbled variant is the same but without the top texture, and is used to craft all Deepslate variants instead
-   Deepslate now has a unique set of sounds! Very crunchy indeed

## Deepslate ores

-   Added Deepslate versions of iron, gold, lapis, redstone and diamond ores that generate wherever those ores replace Deepslate
-   Twice as tough to mine as normal ores

## Ore Distribution Tweaks
