# Minecraft 1.20.1 Release Candidate 1

We're now releasing a Release Candidate for a first minor update for Minecraft 1.20. This minor update will be a stability issue to fix some critical issues found after the release of Minecraft 1.20.

## Fixed bugs in 1.20.1 Release Candidate 1

-   Fixed a disk permissions-related crash
-   [MC-263244](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-263244) The realms invitation icon that appears on the realms button in the main menu is displayed incorrectly
-   [MC-263245](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-263245) Buttons in the "Add Realm" interface within the realms menu no longer render
-   [MC-263296](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-263296) Game softlocks after cancelling joining a server
-   [MC-263340](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-263340) Incorrect Protochunk#setStatus call on chunk generate

---

We are now releasing the first, and hopefully only, release-candidate for 1.20, containing two bug fixes. If all goes well, no further changes will be made before the full release of Minecraft 1.20 on Wednesday next week.

Happy crafting!

## Fixed bugs in 1.20 Release Candidate 1

-   [MC-256477](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-256477) Knowledge books can't be placed in chiseled bookshelves
-   [MC-262853](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-262853) Pitcher plant breaks and floats when growing without enough light

---

Pre-release 7 for Minecraft 1.20 is now available in the Minecraft Launcher. This pre-release adds validation of symbolic links and fixes a bug.

### Changes

To improve safety, the game will now detect symbolic links used inside world directory. For a detailed explanation, check our [help article](https://aka.ms/MinecraftSymLinks).

-   If the target of a symbolic link is not on the user-configured allow-list, the game will not proceed with loading the world
    -   Note: world directory itself can still be linked
-   The list of allowed symbolic link targets is stored in file `allowed_symlinks.txt` in client or server top directory
-   The file consists of entries (one per line) with following formats allowed:
    -   Lines starting with `#` are comments and are ignored
    -   `[type]pattern`, where `type` can be `glob`, `regex` or `prefix`
        -   `prefix` matches start of path with given pattern (so for `/test` paths `/test`, `/test/` and `/test/foo.txt` would match)
        -   `regex` matches regular expression against whole path
        -   `glob` uses OS-specific path matching mechanism (for example `*.txt` would usually match files with `txt` extension)
        -   Note: paths will use OS-specific separators
    -   `pattern`, which uses default `prefix` type

## Fixed bug in 1.20 Pre-release 7

-   [MC-257778](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-257778) Bamboo Mosaic Slabs and Stairs are not in the #slabs and #stairs block and item tags

---

The sixth pre-release of the 1.20 update is here, yet again containing more bug fixes.

Happy mining!

## Technical Changes

-   `"item": "minecraft:air"` can no longer be used in datapack recipes
-   Ingredients in array form are now also allowed in `smithing_trim` and `smithing_transform` recipes on fields `template`, `base` and `addition`
    -   Those fields also allow empty arrays, which signalize that slot needs to be left empty

### Loot tables

#### Random sequences

The ID of the random sequence is now an optional field. If no sequence name is given, loot is drawn using a non-deterministic random source.

## Fixed bugs in 1.20 Pre-Release 6

-   [MC-237042](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-237042) Killing players in the sneaking state that have their sneak option set to "Toggle" in their accessibility settings, results in other players not being able to see them in this state when they respawn
-   [MC-241326](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-241326) Thomas Guimbreti√®re's name is listed twice and misspelt in the credits
-   [MC-260411](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-260411) Re-summoned dragons don't spawn end gateways when exiting the world before killing the dragon
-   [MC-262340](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-262340) Iron Golems can spawn on transparent blocks
-   [MC-262575](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-262575) Company names are still inconsistent in the credits

It is now time for the first Pre-release for Minecraft 1.20: The Trails and Tales update!

From now on, you should mostly see bugs being fixed. In addition to that, pre-releases don't follow the regular snapshot cadence of releasing on Wednesdays, so keep an eye out for the next pre-release.

As always, a big thank you to the community for your feedback, bugs reported, and awesome ideas throughout the snapshot series. Let the pre-releases commence!

## Changes

-   Colored Wool, Carpets and Beds can now be dyed to any other color

## Technical Changes

-   Added new damage types: `outside_border` and `generic_kill`
-   Random sequences for loot tables are now deterministic
-   Changes in `server.properties` encoding
-   `string` data sources for the `data` command now accept negative boundaries, which are interpreted as index counted from the end of the string

### Damage Types

-   Players outside the world border are now hurt by the damage type `outside_border` instead of `in_wall`
-   Forcibly removing an entity using i.e. the `/kill` command now uses damage type `generic_kill` instead of `out_of_world`

### Loot Table Random Sequences

The game now uses named random sequences to deterministically produce loot for loot tables. Each random sequence produces a unique sequence based on the world seed and sequence ID, which means a loot table will produce the same results when ran with the same parameters in the same world.

The ID of the random sequence to use for a loot table is specified in a new field called `random_sequence`.

### `server.properties`

-   File is now read in UTF-8 initially, with previous encoding (ISO 8859-1/Latin 1) as a fallback
-   File is now written with UTF-8 encoding
