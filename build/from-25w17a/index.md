# Minecraft Snapshot 25w17a

After a long weekend we are back with another snapshot! This week we are moving the locator bar out of experiments, try it out and continue to give us your feedback over at [feedback.minecraft.net](http://feedback.minecraft.net/). We have also made some improvements to the Realms UI including region selection for your world. Happy Mining!

## New Features

-   Added an option to reduce the cloud range
-   Added the Locator Bar, a new HUD element that shows the direction of other Players in multiplayer

### Locator Bar

The Locator Bar is a new default UI element that displays the direction of other players in the world.

If there are no other players in the world the experience bar will display as normal, otherwise if another player is in the world (and that player is not hiding) then the experience bar will appear when experience is gained, otherwise the Locator Bar will display in the same area.

-   Multiplayer servers can toggle the Locator Bar with the `locatorBar` gamerule
-   Players can hide by crouching, wearing a mob head or a Carved Pumpkin, or using a Potion of Invisibility
-   Players in Spectator Mode are not visible on the Locator Bar
    -   However, Spectating player are visible to each other
-   Facing other players within a 120 degrees range will display those players as colored indicators on the Locator Bar
    -   Other players that are above/below the screen will also display an up/down arrow with their indicator
    -   The indicator will change to different sized icons depending on how far away the other Player is
    -   Colored indicators are randomized for each player
        -   Servers can modify the colors of indicators with the `/waypoint` command
            -   eg: `/waypoint modify @s color red` to set an indicator to red
        -   Players on a team will override their default indicator color with their team color

#### Player Changes

-   Crouching will hide the player, preventing them from appearing on the Locator Bar of other players
-   Spectators are only visible to other spectators on the Locator Bar

#### Item Changes

-   The following items will hide players when worn in the head slot:
    -   Carved Pumpkin
    -   Skeleton Skull
    -   Wither Skeleton Skull
    -   Player Head
    -   Zombie Head
    -   Creeper Head
    -   Dragon Head
    -   Piglin Head

#### Potion Changes

-   Using a Potion of Invisibility will also hide players from the Locator Bar

## Changes

-   Improvements to the Realms configuration screen
-   Introduced a Region Preference setting that allows for more granular control over what region a Realm is started

### Realms

-   Changed the layout of the Realms configuration screen to use tabs
    -   A Worlds tab containing changes to any of the world slots, creating new worlds and changing their settings
    -   A Players tab to manage the players that have access and their level of access to the Realm
    -   A Subscription tab to manage the Realms subscription
    -   A Settings tab to change the settings of the Realm
-   Introduced a Region Preference setting that allows for more granular control over what region a Realm is started
-   Changed wording for `Close`/`Open` Realm to `Temporarily close`/`Reopen` Realm

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 74
-   The Resource Pack version is now 58
-   Added a Server-authoritative Waypoint broadcasting system for controlling the Locator Bar behavior for Players

## Data Pack Version 74

### Commands

#### Added `waypoint`

This is a new command for querying and modifying waypoints.

    waypoint list
    
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> color <color>
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> color hex <hex-color>
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> color reset
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> style <waypoint_style/resource>
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> style reset
    

Arguments:

-   `entity-selector`: For selecting entities that are transmitting as waypoints (see `waypoint_transmit_range` attribute)
-   `color`: Overrides the Locator Bar icon color for this waypoint
-   `hex <hex-color>` arguments are in web format (RRGGBB)
    -   Red is either `hex F00` or `hex FF0000`
    -   Cornflower blue is `hex 6495ED`
-   `style`: For changing the icon spriteset and selection distances
    -   `set <waypoint_style/resource>` changes the style to a specific asset under `waypoint_style/`
    -   `reset` will restore the default icon behavior of the Locator Bar

##### Waypoint Styles

These define custom icons to be displayed on the Locator Bar and are within the `waypoint_style/` asset directory.

The default implementation is as such:

    {
      "near_distance": 128,
      "far_distance": 332,
      "sprites": [
        "minecraft:default_0",
        "minecraft:default_1",
        "minecraft:default_2",
        "minecraft:default_3"
      ]
    }
    

-   `near_distance` and `far_distance` are optional and default to the values `128` and `332` respectively.
    -   `far_distance` distance must be greater than `near_distance`
-   Each sprite is searched within the prefix of `hud/locator_bar_dot/` (the directory `textures/gui/sprites/hud/locator_bar_dot`).

### Game Rules

#### Added `locatorBar`

-   Default is `true`: enabling the Locator Bar
-   Changing to `false` will remove all existing Waypoints from all players
-   The Game Rule has been renamed from `useLocatorBar` during the experiment. This may break minor command related features in worlds created in the previous snapshot.

#### Added `waypoint_transmit_range` and `waypoint_receive_range`

-   Default: `0.0`, Minimum: `0.0`, Maximum: `60000000.0`
-   Players have a default transmission and receive range of 60,000,000
-   Mobs with a transmission range above zero will send waypoint packets to nearby receivers that are within that range
-   Similarly, receivers only receive waypoints that are inside their receive range (and receive nothing if that range is zero)

Examples:

-   `/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_transmit_range base set 0` will prevent a player from transmitting (hiding them)
-   `/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_transmit_range base set 80` will only let a player transmit up to 80 blocks (hiding them from players further than that)
-   `/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_receive_range base set 0` will prevent a player from receiving (turns off their Locator Bar)
-   `/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_receive_range base set 120` will only let a player see Locator Bar dots that are within 120 blocks (hiding all players further than that)

### Waypoint Broadcasting

The Locator Bar works by a server-controlled Waypoint system. Waypoints are received by Players, and connections between Waypoints and Players are managed by the multiplayer server.

-   By default, all Players transmit a Waypoint from themselves, and all Players receive all Waypoints
-   Individual Players can have their transmission and receive ranges controlled by the `waypoint_transmit_range` and `waypoint_receive_range` attributes

### Tags

#### Block Tags

-   Added `happy_ghast_avoids` - blocks that happy ghasts avoid getting close to
-   Added `triggers_ambient_dried_ghast_block_sounds` - blocks that can trigger ambient Dried Ghast sounds to play when a Dried Ghast block is placed on them

## Resource Pack Version 58

### Shaders & Post-process Effects

#### `Fog` Uniform Block

-   `FOG_IS_SKY` has been removed in favour of splitting up the sky shader

# Minecraft Snapshot 25w16a

In this week’s snapshot leads are getting new mechanics making it possible to leash mobs together or leash them to entities like boats! Now you can travel the desert with your own camel caravan or airlift your treasures in a boat with chest attached to your happy ghast. Moving villagers have never been easier! As you are soaring through the skies you will see that the clouds render infinitely.

## Changes

-   Changed leash mechanics
-   Changed Elytra so that while gliding, using a firework will only be used as a boost even if placed on a block
-   Clouds now exist all the way to the horizon
-   Reverted the fix for [MC-101556](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-101556): Nether Portal teleport range is too large (equivalent to a full block)

> **Developer's Note**: _After consideration, we have decided to revert this change as it came in quite late in the snapshot cycle and unintentionally broke some functionality that our community were relying on. We'd like to revisit this at some point when we have time to deal with the issues that showed up due to this change_

### Leash changes

-   Leashes are now rendered twice as thick, to match bedrock
-   Leashes can now be used to leash two mobs together
    -   Sneak-interact on any mob while holding a bunch of leashed mobs will leash these mobs to the interacted entity
    -   You now cannot leash anything to itself
-   If the re-leashing an entity would result in immediate leash snapping due to distance, the re-leashing would not happen
-   Leashes can be snipped from an entity when interacting them with Shears
    -   This applies to its own leash connection as well as all entities attached to it
    -   Dispensers can now snip leashes from entities in front of them when they are equipped with Shears
-   Improved leash mechanics, with reworked leash physics, allowing for more stable leash connection, especially when leashed entities are not on ground
    -   When dragged on the leash, leashed objects will now orient themselves towards the leasher
    -   Using a firework rocket when flying with leashed entities will now break the leash connections
-   When leashing an already leashed mob, the current leash will now snap and a player will re-leash the object to yourself
    -   You cannot steal leashed entities from other players
-   Interactions with a Leash Knot and Fence Blocks have changed:
    -   When interacting with a Leash Knot or a Fence Block, if there are any player-leashed entities in range of the leash knot, they will be re-leashed to the Leash Knot or a Fence Block
    -   In case of attaching of mobs fails due to distance or there is nothing to attach, the player will now transfer all fence leashed entities to itself
    -   If there is nothing left attached to the Leash Knot, it disappears
    -   Sneak-interact can only result in attaching of the player mobs to the fence
    -   Interacting with Shears or punching the Leash Knot will result in all current connections broken
-   Boats and large mobs that can be leashed, but cannot fit in the boat (Horses, Donkey, Mule, Camel and Sniffer) can now be leashed in a special 4-leash configuration to the Happy Ghast
    -   Happy Ghast will also present a custom layer when its leashing something using a quad connection
    -   Leashed in quad connection are now rendered without slack
-   Leash snapping distance has been changed from 10 to 12 blocks
    -   The distance between centers of entities bounding boxes, rather than their feet is used to determine the distance between two leashed entities
    -   Happy Ghast leash is now longer - with free roaming distance of 10 blocks and leash snapping at 16 blocks

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 73
-   The Resource Pack version is now 57

## Data Pack Version 73

### Data Components

#### `painting/variant` Item Component

-   No longer accepts inline variants

## Resource Pack Version 57

-   All core shader uniforms are now uniform blocks
-   The cloud texture (`clouds.png`) can no longer be colored
-   Block Model rotations are no longer limited to multiplies of `22.5`

### Block Models

-   `elements[].rotation.angle` value in block models is no longer limited to multiplies of `22.5` degrees and can now be any angle from `-45` to `+45`

### Shaders & Post-process Effects

> **Developer's Note**: _Although it is possible in Resource Packs, overriding Core Shaders is considered as unsupported and not an intended Resource Pack feature. These shaders exist as part of the internal implementation of the game, and as such, may change at any time as the game's internals evolve. We understand that overriding Core Shaders is used for very cool Resource Pack features, many of which lack supported alternatives. We would like to provide better, supported alternatives in the future._

-   All built-in uniforms are now uniform blocks instead of opaque loose uniforms
-   Custom uniforms provided to post-process shaders are now uniform blocks
-   Uniform definitions inside json files are now per-block

#### Post-process Effect Definitions

-   Entries in the `targets` map have been expanded to support new properties
    -   New optional boolean field: `persistent` (default: `false`)
        -   If `true`, this render target will be persistent across frames
        -   The contents of the target will be cleared when the screen is resized
    -   New optional field: `clear_color` (default: `[0, 0, 0, 0]`)
        -   Format: integer ARGB value, or float array in order `[R, G, B, A]`
        -   When this target is created or cleared, it will be filled with this color
-   The `uniforms` values is now a list-per-block, instead of a global list
    -   e.g. `uniforms: { "UniformBlockName": [ { "type": "vec2", "value": [...] } ] }`
        -   The order of uniforms in a block **must** match the order in the shader
-   `name` as part of a uniform definition is no longer used
    -   We encourage setting it to help keep the json file organised/readable, but the game won't use it
-   `value` as part of a uniform definition replaces the old `values`, and the type depends on the `type` field
    -   This field is required
    -   `"type": "int"` needs `"value": 123` (a single int)
    -   `"type": "float"` needs `"value": 123.4` (a single float)
    -   `"type": "vec2"` needs `"value": [1.2, 3.4]` (two floats)
    -   `"type": "vec3"` needs `"value": [1.2, 3.4, 5.6]` (three floats)
    -   `"type": "ivec3"` needs `"value": [1, 2, 3]` (three ints)
    -   `"type": "vec4"` needs `"value": [1.2, 3.4, 5.6, 7.8]` (four floats)
    -   `"type": "matrix4x4"` needs `"value": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0, 15.0, 16.0]` (four rows of four columns of floats)
-   We do not validate that the uniform block is valid for a given shader, giving incorrect information will cause undefined and funky behavior

#### Post-process Effect Shaders

-   Instead of every uniform being an individual opaque type, they are now grouped in uniform blocks
    -   They will be set according to the pass definition in the json file, and may be shared across both vertex and fragment shaders
-   The list of sizes (all `vec2 *Size` uniforms) are now replaced with a single `SamplerInfo` uniform block
    -   This contains, _in order_, the size of the output texture followed by the size every input texture
    -   The order of textures in the definition file will dictate the order of samplers in this uniform
    -   For most post chains this is just `OutSize` and `InSize` as before
    -   All sizes are `vec2`

##### `post/bits.fsh`

-   Expects a `BitsConfig` of `float Resolution` and `float MosaicSize`

##### `post/blit.fsh`

-   Expects a `BlitConfig` of `vec4 ColorModulate`

##### `post/blur.vsh` and `post/box_blur.fsh`

-   Expects a `BlurConfig` of `vec2 BlurDir` and `float Radius`

##### `post/color_convolve.fsh`

-   Expects a `ColorConfig` of `vec3 RedMatrix`, `vec3 GreenMatrix` and `vec3 BlueMatrix`

##### `post/invert.fsh`

-   Expects a `InvertConfig` of `float InverseAmount`

##### `post/rotscale.vsh`

-   Expects a `RotScaleConfig` of `vec2 InScale`, `vec2 InOffset` and `float InRotation`

##### `post/spiderclip.fsh`

-   Expects a `SpiderConfig` of `vec4 Scissor` and `vec4 Vignette`

#### `Globals` Uniform Block

-   Available through `#moj_import <minecraft:globals.glsl>` for convenience
-   Most shaders are able to receive this uniform block, even if they don't normally use it
-   Contains `ScreenSize`, `GlintAlpha`, `GameTime` and `MenuBlurRadius` (new)
    -   `MenuBlurRadius` is the blur radius of the background when a menu is open

#### `Fog` Uniform Block

-   Available through `#moj_import <minecraft:fog.glsl>` for convenience
-   Most shaders are able to receive this uniform block, even if they don't normally use it
-   Contains `FogColor`, `FogShape`, `FogStart`, `FogEnd`, `FogSkyEnd` (new) and `FogCloudsEnd` (new)
    -   `FogSkyEnd` is new and represents where the fog should end when drawing for the sky
    -   `FogCloudsEnd` is new and represents where the fog should end when drawing the clouds
    -   `FogEnd` is the "normal" fog cutoff as before
-   `FOG_IS_SKY` is now available to the `position.vsh`/`position.fsh` shaders when they are rendering for the sky

#### `Projection` Uniform Block

-   Available through `#moj_import <minecraft:projection.glsl>` for convenience
-   Most shaders are able to receive this uniform block, even if they don't normally use it
-   Contains `ProjMat` with no changes

#### `DynamicTransforms` Uniform Block

-   Available through `#moj_import <minecraft:dynamictransforms.glsl>` for convenience
-   Is no longer available to shaders that do not normally use it
-   Contains `ModelViewMat`, `ColorModulator`, `ModelOffset`, `TextureMat`, `LineWidth`
    -   These are very likely to change in the near future
    -   The values of some of these are often hard coded and may not make sense for a given shader, ie `LineWidth` in any non-line based pipeline

#### `Lighting` Uniform Block

-   Available through `#moj_import <minecraft:light.glsl>` for convenience
-   Most shaders are able to receive this uniform block, even if they don't normally use it
    -   The values may not make sense if the shader wouldn't normally expect it, however
-   Contains `Light0_Direction` and `Light1_Direction`

#### `CloudInfo` Uniform Block

-   Only available to the clouds shaders (`rendertype_clouds.vsh`/`rendertype_clouds.fsh`)
    -   Contains `CloudColor`, `CloudOffset` and `CellSize` (new)
        -   `CellSize` contains the size of an individual cloud cell

#### `LightmapInfo` Uniform Block

-   Only available to the lightmap shader (`lightmap.fsh`)
-   Contains `AmbientLightFactor`, `SkyFactor`, `BlockFactor`, `UseBrightLightmap`, `NightVisionFactor`, `DarknessScale`, `DarkenWorldFactor`, `BrightnessFactor`, `SkyLightColor` with no change in behavior

# Minecraft Snapshot 25w15a

Snapshot on a Tuesday? Yes! From now on we will be moving snapshots to the same weekday as full releases, Tuesdays.

This week we are releasing the first snapshot of the second game drop of 2025, including the happy ghast, ghastling, dried ghast and ghast harness. Experience soaring new gameplay thanks to the happy ghast, and discover how to raise one of your own – from retrieving a dried ghast block from the Nether to submerging it in water in the Overworld to spawn a ghastling. We are also adding the locator bar to Java this week, you can finally easily find your friends when you are out adventuring.

Take your first test flight with the happy ghast, craft your own dried ghast – and send us your [feedback](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/topics/35301401438605-Upcoming-Game-Drop-Features?sort_by=votes)!

## New Features

-   Added Dried Ghast block
-   Added Happy Ghast mob
-   Added Harness items
-   Added new advancements

### Dried Ghast block

-   Can be found in the Nether in Nether Fossil structures
-   Is crafted with 1 Bone Block and 8 Ghast Tears
-   When waterlogged it undergoes 3 state changes over about 20 minutes until it spawns a Ghastling mob
-   Makes sounds and shows particles depending on the state
-   If mined during the waterlogging, it will revert to its “dry” state regardless of what state it has reached during waterlogging
-   Will revert states back to its initial “dry” state when it is taken away from being waterlogged, using the same time scale

### Happy Ghast mob

#### Ghastling

-   Ghastling is a young version of the Happy Ghast mob
-   Spawns from a Dried Ghast block that has continuously been waterlogged for about 20 minutes
-   After spawning, the Ghastling will try and follow:
    -   Players within a 16-block radius or
    -   An adult, non-aquatic passive mob (and some neutral mobs) within a 16-block radius
-   If no player or suitable mob is close around the Ghastling will idle around within 32 blocks from its home position (where it spawned or last was interacted with)
    -   It will reset its home position if it is moved more than 16 blocks away from the border of its home area
-   Can be tempted and fed using Snowballs
-   Will grow up into a Happy Ghast after about 20 minutes (or faster if fed Snowballs)

#### Happy Ghast

-   The adult Happy Ghast is a new flying mount that can carry up to four players
-   Grows up from a Ghastling after about 20 minutes (or faster if the Ghastling is fed Snowballs)
-   Can be equipped with a Harness and then be mounted by up to 4 players
-   Tempted by Snowballs and Harness
    -   Harness tempting only works if the Happy Ghast is unharnessed
-   Has no panic behavior when taking damage
-   Cannot be bred
-   Slowly regenerates health, with regeneration speeding up during rain, snow or when flying at the same height as clouds are rendered
-   The first player that mounts the Happy Ghast will control it, sitting in front of the Happy Ghast, just above its face
    -   Pressing the forward key will make the Happy Ghast fly in the direction the player is looking
    -   Pressing the back key will make the Happy Ghast fly in the opposite direction the player is looking
    -   Pressing the left and right keys will strafe the Happy Ghast in the respective direction
    -   Pressing the jump key will make the Happy Ghast fly directly up
    -   Pressing the sneak key will make the player dismount the Happy Ghast
-   When a player mounts, the goggles on the Happy Ghast go down to cover its eyes, indicating that it now can be controlled
-   Players mounted after the first player piloting the Happy Ghast are placed in slots on each side of it, starting clockwise from the first player
-   Pressing crouch button dismounts the player on top of the Happy Ghast
-   If the Happy Ghast detects players on top of it, it then ceases all movement and aligns to the closest cardinal horizontal direction
-   This happens regardless of it having a Harness equipped or not
-   3rd person camera is moved back when player is mounted on the Happy Ghast
-   When there are no players mounted or walking on the Happy Ghast, the goggles go up and the Happy Ghast starts to roam around the home position
-   If players dismount midair, the Happy Ghast will descend towards the ground before it resumes roaming
-   Cannot enter boats
-   Idles around within 64 blocks from its home position in the similar way as the Ghastling
    -   If wearing a Harness, the Happy Ghast idles closer to the home position (within 32 blocks)
-   The Happy Ghast will try to stay close to blocks when roaming on its own

### Ghast

-   Updated Ghast texture

### Harness items

-   Harness is a new item that can be equipped on a Happy Ghast to allow players to ride it
-   It is 16 new items, one for each color
-   Crafted out of 3 Leather, 2 Glass blocks and 1 Wool block, the Harness will have the same color as the Wool block used when crafting
-   Can be re-dyed
-   Can only be equipped on a Happy Ghast
-   Allows up to 4 players to mount the Happy Ghast
-   Can be removed from the Happy Ghast using Shears but only when no players are mounted

### Advancements

-   Added new "Stay Hydrated!" Husbandry Advancemet when a Dried Ghast Block is placed into Water
-   Added "Heart Transplanter" Adventure Advancement that is unlocked when a player places a Creaking Heart with the correct alignment between two Pale Oak Log blocks

## Experimental Features

-   This snapshot introduces a new experimental Feature Toggle that adds a locator bar to find your friends easily. You must turn on this Feature Toggle in the Experiments Menu when creating a new world if you want to test the locator bar. You can find more information about Feature Toggles [here](https://www.minecraft.net/article/testing-new-minecraft-features/feature-toggles-java-edition).

### Locator Bar

The Locator Bar is an experimental new UI element for players that displays the direction of Waypoints.

-   This experiment allows servers to manage Waypoints and their connections with Players
-   By default, all Players transmit a Waypoint from themselves, and all Players receive all Waypoints; allowing players to locate other players in multiplayer
-   The Locator Bar will display colored indicators when the camera is facing within 120 degrees towards a Waypoint. If a Waypoint is above/below the camera's viewport (the screen) an up/down arrow will display
-   Any Waypoint that is determined to be a Player or Mob that belongs to a Team then the color indicator will match the Team color

#### Player Changes

-   Crouching will hide the player, preventing them from appearing on the Locator Bar of other players
-   Spectators are only visible to other spectators on the Locator Bar

#### Item Changes

-   The following items will hide players when worn in the head slot:
    -   Carved Pumpkin
    -   Skeleton Skull
    -   Wither Skeleton Skull
    -   Player Head
    -   Zombie Head
    -   Creeper Head
    -   Dragon Head
    -   Piglin Head

#### Potion Changes

-   Using a Potion of Invisibility will also hide players from the Locator Bar

#### Game Rules

##### Added `useLocatorBar`

-   Default is enabled for servers running the Locator Bar experiment
-   Toggling to off will remove all existing Waypoints from all players

#### Attributes

##### Added `waypoint_transmit_range` and `waypoint_receive_range`

-   Default: `0.0`, Minimum: `0.0`, Maximum: `60000000.0`
-   Players have a default transmission and receive range of 60,000,000
-   Mobs with a transmission range above zero will send waypoint packets to nearby receivers
-   Similarly, receivers only receive with a range above zero, and cannot receive waypoints outside of this range

#### `waypoint` command

This is a new command for querying and modifying waypoints.

    waypoint list
    
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> color <color>
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> color hex <hex-color>
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> color reset
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> fade <fade_start> <alpha_start> <fade_end> <alpha_end>
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> fade reset
    

Parameters:

-   `entity-selector`: For selecting entities that are transmitting as waypoints (see `waypoint_transmit_range` attribute)
-   `color`: Overrides the Locator Bar icon color for this waypoint
-   `hex <hex-color>` arguments are in web format (RRGGBB)
    -   Red is either `hex F00` or `hex FF0000`
    -   Cornflower blue is `hex 6495ED`
-   `fade`: Set the fade out effect for waypoints
    -   The arguments `<fade_start> <alpha_start> <fade_end> <alpha_end>` handle the starting/ending fade distance & alpha opacity
        -   `*_start` is the nearby values (closest to the player)
        -   `*_end` is the far values (furthest from the player)
    -   `reset` will restore the default behavior of distant Locator Bar icons fading out to 0.2 alpha

## Changes

-   Updated the textures for the Ghast
-   Increased the third-person camera distance when spectating or riding Ghasts, Ender Dragons, and Giants
-   Wolves, Sheep and Pigs now have their legs mirrored
-   Spectators will now teleport together with, but stop spectating, entities that move to other dimensions
-   Rules for when ambient desert blocks sounds play have been tweaked

### Ambient Desert Block Sounds Changes

-   Ambient sand sounds no longer require sky access to play
-   Ambient sand sounds now have a slightly decreased chance to play
-   Terracotta blocks no longer trigger ambient sand sounds

-   The Resource Pack version is now 56
-   Pressing F3 + V now prints client-side version information

> **Developer's Note**: _The GUI rendering code is undergoing a significant refactoring in this Snapshot series. The version of it released in this Snapshot is not supposed to be final and will be further iterated upon._

## Data Pack Version 72

-   Dimension Type definitions have a new optional field, `cloud_height` that indicates on what y-level the clouds start in the dimension

    -   `id` - new pack name, must be a valid directory name
    -   `name` - text component to be placed in `description` in `pack.mcmeta`

### Attributes

#### Added `camera_distance`

-   Default value: `4.0`
-   Modifies the distance at which the camera is placed away from the player or spectated entity when in a third-person view
-   If the entity being ridden has a larger `camera_distance` attribute, that distance will be used
-   This distance is multiplied by the `scale` attribute to get a final target camera distance

### Data Components

---

# Minecraft 1.21.5 Pre-Release 1

Today we're shipping the first pre-release of Minecraft 1.21.5. From now on you will mostly see bug fixes and technical tweaks until the start of the next snapshot cycle. As we enter the pre-release phase we will be releasing more frequently than our regular cadence on Wednesdays, so keep an eye out for the next pre-release!

## Changes

-   Added Spawn Eggs textures for programmer art texture pack

## Technical Changes

-   The Resource Pack version is now 55
-   Arguments in commands that accept inline values like loot tables, predicates, modifiers, data components, formatted text (`/loot`, `/give`, `/tellraw`, `/execute if predicate`, data components in `/execute if items`, etc.) have been reverted to accept numbers in place of booleans

> **Developer's Note**: The original change happened because we moved away from using NBT as an intermediate format for parsing those values, which meant that booleans were separated from numbers (similar to handling in JSON). We've decided to temporarily revert that, since some functionality can't be achieved yet without using storage and macro functions. However, once that missing functionality is added (and data can be transferred without being converted to and from text), legacy boolean handling will be removed once again.

### Network Protocol

-   The clientbound `player_chat` packet now contains an index increasing for every message sent to the client
    -   The index starts at 0 when logging in (or is reset by configuration phase and the `login` packet)
    -   For every message, the server should increment this value by 1
    -   If this value updates in an unexpected way, the client will disconnect
    -   As the protocol requires that every chat packet reaches the client in produced order, the goal is to enable faster detection of missed/reordered chat messages for custom server developers
-   The serverbound `chat` and `chat_command_signed` packets now contain a checksum byte along with the 'last seen' update
    -   This is a simple hash of the 'last seen' signatures which should be reconstructed by the server, allowing quicker detection of desynchronized state
    -   This can be passed as `0` to disable the check, for compatibility with protocol translation

## Resource Pack Version 55

-   Tweaked Leaf Litter block models

## Fixed bugs in 1.21.5 Pre-Release 1

-   [MC-170134](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-170134) Minecraft uses several times more VRAM than needed after exploring terrain for a while
-   [MC-279350](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-279350) Leaf litter multipart model system is unoptimized, causing render lag
-   [MC-280141](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-280141) Baby farm animals from spawn eggs with a variant differing from the parent flash the wrong variant initially
-   [MC-280241](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-280241) Cold Cows have improperly mirrored and incorrectly aligned ear textures
-   [MC-280249](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-280249) Spawn eggs don't use their old textures with the Programmer Art resource pack enabled
-   [MC-280278](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-280278) Sheep wool uses 1.14 texture with Programmer Art resource pack enabled

-   [MC-280361](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-280361) When a fallen tree replaces the bottom half of tall vegetation, the top part of the vegetation still generates
-   [MC-280474](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-280474) TNT minecarts explode regardless of tntExplodes gamerule
-   [MC-280477](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-280477) TNT still explodes when summoned or dispensed while tntExplodes gamerule is false
-   [MC-280479](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-280479) TNT is completely deleted when attempting to ignite it using redstone pulses when the “tntExplodes” gamerule is disabled
-   [MC-280480](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-280480) No flint and steel clicking sound when attempting to ignite TNT with a flint and steel when the "tntExplodes" gamerule is disabled
-   [MC-280493](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-280493) If the tntExplodes game rule is changed to false while primed TNT already exists in the world, the primed TNT explodes as normal
-   [MC-280501](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-280501) The "Fire extinguishes" sound plays every game tick while on fire in rain
-   [MC-280520](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-280520) ItemDropChance on an item frame is not serialized when there is no item anymore, leading to inconsistencies

# Minecraft Snapshot 25w10a

It's time for a new Minecraft snapshot! We've got some more under-the-hood updates including a `tntExplodes` game rule previously found in Bedrock edition, new features in SNBT syntax, and allowing all entities to store custom data. We also have some more bug fixes coming your way.

You can now also enjoy a new main menu background, happy mining!

## Changes

-   The Sheep wool texture has been tweaked to remove the stark line at the back
-   Blocks that are broken by a Piston now play their breaking sound
-   Updated the menu panorama for the first Game Drop of the year
-   The textures of Test Blocks and Test Instance Blocks have been updated
-   Cactus Flowers can now be placed on Farmland

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 70
-   The Resource Pack version is now 54

## Data Pack Version 70

-   All entities can now store custom data
-   Unified format and functionality of predicates for components on Entities and Block Entities
-   New operations for SNBT
-   Added new `tntExplodes` Game Rule
-   Added `#flowers` item tag - corresponding item tag for the already existing `#flowers` block tag

### Entity Data

-   Custom data (previously present only on Marker) is now available on all entities
    -   It's exposed as a `minecraft:custom_data` component, so it can be set by spawning items and matched by predicates
    -   The component is currently stored in a field called `data`, which will be changed in the future when more proper storage for entity components is introduced
    -   It's stored only if it's non-empty

### Entity Predicates

-   A new optional field has been added to entity predicates: `predicates`
    -   Its functionality and format is identical to the field `predicates` on item predicates, but they operate on entity components
        -   When present, `predicates` will match partial contents of entity components

### Block Predicates

-   New optional fields have been added to block predicates: `components` and `predicates`
-   Their functionality and format are identical to the fields `components` and `predicates` on item predicates, but they operate on block entity components (when present)
    -   When present, `components` will match exact contents of block entity components
    -   When present, `predicates` will match partial contents of block entity components

### SNBT Format

-   To simplify input of data and macro use, SNBT now also supports following operations:
    -   `bool(arg)` - converts argment to boolean
        -   if argument is a boolean value, returns value directly
        -   if argument is a number value, returns `true` if it is non-zero
    -   `uuid(str)` - converts string representation of UUID to integer array
-   Implicit infinite float values (like `1e1000`) are now rejected

### `tntExplodes` Game Rule

-   When `false`, TNT will not explode and cannot be primed
-   Default value: `true`

## Resource Pack Version 54

-   "Global" uniforms may now be defined in any shader, and the game will attempt to fill it
    -   Currently, these are: `ModelViewMat`, `ProjMat`, `TextureMat`, `ScreenSize`, `ColorModulator`, `Light0_Direction`, `Light1_Direction`, `GlintAlpha`, `FogStart`, `FogEnd`, `FogColor`, `FogShape`, `LineWidth`, `GameTime`, `ModelOffset`
    -   The type of the uniform must match what it would normally be, or it'll be undefined behavior

# Minecraft Snapshot 25w09a

In this week's snapshot, we are bringing a long-awaited feature into parity as fallen trees are making their debut in Java Edition. Additionally, firefly bushes can now generate in mangrove swamps and rarely in badlands.

On the technical side, SNBT syntax in commands has been expanded and improved, including fixing bugs related to SNBT text components preventing escapes from working.

## New Features

-   Added fallen trees to be in parity with Bedrock Edition

### Fallen Trees

-   Fallen trees are a new decorative variant of trees
-   Fallen trees come in four different wood type variants:
    -   Oak
    -   Birch
    -   Jungle
    -   Spruce
-   Birch fallen trees can come in a shorter version or a longer version
-   Some fallen trees can be decorated with mushroom or vines
-   Fallen trees can be found in all biomes where their standing tree variant grow, except the following:
    -   Meadow
    -   Bamboo Jungle
    -   River
    -   Grove
    -   Flower Forest has fallen birch trees but not fallen oak trees

## Changes

### Leaf Litter

-   Leaf Litter is now replaceable by other blocks

### Firefly Bush

-   The Firefly Bush can now generate near water in Mangrove Swamps and Badlands (very rarely), like other biomes with water

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 69

-   The `posY` field now defaults to `1` if not specified

### NBT changes

-   Any interface with NBT data within the game (SNBT representation, `/data`) now supports heterogeneous lists, i.e. ones where elements are not of the same type
    -   Inserting or replacing into a list of a different type with `/data` will no longer give an error
    -   Inserting into an array type (e.g. `[I;1,2,3]`) is still type-restricted
    -   This means that the 'wrapper' objects previously used to represent heterogeneous lists will no longer be observable by in-game means
-   `/data` can no longer traverse paths with an empty key (e.g. `/data get ... foo.''.bar`)
-   The NBT file format is unchanged:
    -   Heterogeneous lists are transformed before storage to bypass NBT constraints
    -   Example transform: `['a', {'b':3}]` is stored as `[{'':'a'},{'b':3}]`
    -   Existing external tools will still be able to read NBT files as before, but heterogeneous lists will be displayed in the transformed form
-   No data produced by the game has changed: objects such as Text Components were already producing heterogeneous lists in this form
-   Note: these wrapper objects may never be observed in-game, they are only relevant to developers working with the NBT file or network format directly

### SNBT Changes

-   The text format for describing object-like data in commands (like NBT, text components, predicates, etc.) has been extended

#### Number Format

-   Either whole or fraction parts of a float number can be omitted
    -   Examples: `.1` and `1.` are valid now
-   Float numbers now use E notation
    -   Example: both `1.2e3` and `1.2E3`, `1.2E+3`, `12000e-1` are now a valid way to represent `1200.0`
-   Integer numbers can now be prefixed with `0x` to represent hexadecimal numbers and `0b` to represent binary numbers
    -   Example: `0xbad` (equal to `2989`), `0xCAFE` (equal to `51966`), `0b101` (equal to `5`)
-   Integer numbers now can't start with `0`
    -   Normally it would mean number is in base-8, but we are restricting it to avoid accidental use
-   Numbers can now contain `_` character between sequences of digits (but not at the start or the end of sequence)
    -   Example: `0b10_01`, `0xAB_CD`, `1_2.3_4__5f`, `1_2e3_4`
-   `NaN`, `Inf` or hexadecimal float representation are NOT supported
-   Type suffixes have been extended:
    -   Integer type suffixes (`b` or `B` - byte, `s` or `S` - short, `i` or `I` - integer, `l` or `L`) can now be prefixed with `s` (signed) or `u` unsigned
    -   New suffixes only affect valid range when parsing - values are still stored as signed
        -   Example: `240ub` is equal to `-16sb`, while `240sb` does not parse
    -   When a suffix is used without `u` or `s`, it defaults to signed for decimal numbers and unsigned for binary and hexadecimal numbers
    -   Note: since `b` is also a valid hexadecimal digit, byte sized hexadecimal values can only be written with a signed suffix, like `0x11ub` or `0x11sb`

#### Strings

-   Quoted strings can now use escape sequences beyond `\'`, `\"` and `\\`:
    -   Unicode escapes:
        -   `\x` - two digit escape, like `\x42`
        -   `\u` - four digit escape, like `\u2603`
        -   `\U` - eight digit escape, like `\U00002603`
        -   `\N{<name>}` - named Unicode character, like `\N{Snowman}`
    -   Built-in escape sequences:
        -   `\b` - backspace, Unicode `\x08`
        -   `\s` - space, Unicode `\x20`
        -   `\t` - horizontal tab, Unicode `\x09`
        -   `\n` - linefeed, Unicode `\u0a`
        -   `\f` - form feed, Unicode `\u0c`
        -   `\r` - carriage return, Unicode `\u0d`
-   Unquoted strings now can't start with `0-9`, `.`, `+`, `-` to avoid accidental collision with numbers

#### Number arrays

-   Values in arrays (`[B;]`, `[I;]`, `[L;]`) without a suffix are now assumed to have suffix matching the type of the array
    -   Example: `[B;1,2]` is equivalent to `[B; 1b, 2b]`
-   Arrays can now also accept types smaller than the array type
    -   Example: `[I;1b,2s,3]` is valid and equivalent to `[I;1i,2i,3i]`

#### Lists

-   Lists now accept trailing commas
    -   Example: `[1,2,]` is valid and equivalent to `[1,2]`
    -   Only one trailing comma is allowed, and it must come after a valid element - both `[,]` and `[1,,]` are invalid

#### Compounds

-   Compounds (maps) now accept trailing commas
    -   Example: `{a:b,}`
    -   Only one trailing comma is allowed, and it must come after a valid key-value pair - both `{,}` and `{a:b,,}` are invalid

# Minecraft Snapshot 25w08a

We're adding some new, fun and cute features in this week's snapshot. Spawn eggs just got cuter with new textures looking more like the mobs they spawn. Wolves are becoming even more unique with their own individual sounds. When a wolf spawns, it will get one of seven personalities, unrelated to their variant or biome. From cute to grumpy, each wolf will bark, growl, pant, whine, and express themselves in their own unique way. To top it all off, leaf litter will now look even better with new colors and we have made some tweaks to what color of sheep spawns in different biomes.

Have fun exploring!

## New Features

-   Added new sound variants for Wolves
-   Overhauled the visuals of each Spawn Egg to improve readability and accessibility

### Farm Animal variants

#### Sheep wool color in warm and cold biomes

-   Reverted the change from last week that allowed Blue, Light Blue, Cyan, Yellow, Orange and Red Sheep to spawn naturally in different biomes
-   Black Sheep will still be the most common type to spawn in cold biomes, and Brown Sheep will be the most common type in warm biomes
-   Pink Sheep will still be very rare and able to spawn anywhere where Sheep can spawn
-   Uncommon Sheep colors in Cold Biomes are gray, light gray, white and brown
-   Uncommon Sheep colors in Warm Biomes are gray, light gray, white and black

### Leaf Litter

-   Leaf Litter is tinted based on which biome it's in

### Spawn Egg visuals overhaul

-   Each Spawn Egg now has their own unique visual which captures the personality and character of the mob it spawns
-   Each egg visual varies in shape to reflect the in-world size of the mob it spawns
    -   For example, smaller mobs tend to have a smaller Spawn Egg

### Wolf Sounds Variants

-   Added 6 new Wolf sound variants with unique ambient, hurt, death, growl, whine, and pant sounds
    -   The new sounds are part of variants that are called `big`, `cute`, `puglin`, `angry`, `grumpy` and `sad`
    -   The original Wolf sounds now are used for the variant called `classic`
    -   Every Wolf will have a random sound variant assigned to it from the 6 new variants and the original one
    -   The sound variant is not related to the texture variant

## Changes

-   Sheep's wool undercoat is now also colored when dyed, matching existing behaviour in Bedrock Edition
-   Sheep can now eat Fern blocks to match Bedrock Edition

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 68
-   The Resource Pack version is now 53

## Data Pack Version 68

-   Added data driven sound variants for Wolves
-   Biome effects has a new field `dry_foliage_color` that defines the color used for tinting blocks using dry foliage tinting

### Wolf Sound Variants

-   Wolf sound variants can be data-driven by adding entries to `data/<namespace>/wolf_sound_variant/<id>.json`
-   The file contains the following fields which correspond to sound events to use for the specific behaviour:
    -   `ambient_sound`
    -   `death_sound`
    -   `growl_sound`
    -   `hurt_sound`
    -   `pant_sound`
    -   `whine_sound`

### Item Components

#### `blocks_attacks` component

-   If the blocked damage has no position, the compared angle will be assumed to be the maximum `180` for `horizontal_blocking_angle` field of `damage_reductions`

#### Entity components

-   New component
    -   `wolf/sound_variant` - namespaced id from `wolf_sound_variant` registry

## Resource Pack Version 53

-   Added possibility to tint blocks based on a dry foliage color map
-   Updated textures for Spawn Eggs
-   New and updated sounds for Wolf sound variants
-   Added colormap texture for tinting dry foliage tinted blocks
-   Name of `sheep_fur` texture has been renamed to `sheep_wool`
-   Sheep now has a separate texture for its wool undercoat, which is dynamically recolored in-game
    -   The name of this undercoat texture is `sheep_wool_undercoat`

### Updated textures for Spawn Eggs

-   New textures have been added for all Spawn Eggs
-   Removed `spawn_egg.png` and `spawn_egg_overlay.png`

### Equipment Assets

-   Equipment layers configured to be dyeable will now show if the `dyed_color` component is present on the item, even if the item is not in the `#dyeable` tag

### New and updated Wolf sound variants

-   Sound files for the classic Wolf sounds have been moved into `classic` folder for the Wolf sound files
-   Removed unused `howl` sound
-   Added sounds for the new Wolf sound variants: `big`, `cute`, `puglin`, `angry`, `grumpy` and `sad`

## Fixed bugs in 25w08a

-   [MC-177522](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-177522) Wolf barking and whining sounds are subtitled as "Wolf pants"
-   [MC-280182](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-280182) Shields can block some environmental damage sources
-   [MC-280230](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-280230) DeathLootTable field is incorrectly named DeathLoothTable

# Minecraft Snapshot 25w07a

Frogday on a Thursday, who thinks of that?! In this week's snapshot we are updating trades for wandering traders and cartographers. We have also introduced new, biome-based spawn rules for sheep. It's time to go out and explore the world! Mojang's bug-tracker Mojira is migrating to the cloud and during the process bug reporting is unavailable. The new platform will soon be up and running, ready for players to log in, create accounts, and most importantly – report bugs! During the downtime, try to keep the bug alive and report it once Mojira is back!

## New Features

-   Sheep have different rules for which wool color to have based on biome they spawn in

### Farm Animal variants

#### Sheep wool color in warm and cold biomes

-   Sheep have updated rules for which color of wool they have based on which biome they spawn in:
    -   Temperate Biomes: (these colors are unchanged from current behavior)
        -   Common sheep color is white
        -   Uncommon sheep colors are black, gray, light gray and brown
        -   There is a rare chance for a pink Sheep to spawn
    -   Cold biomes:
        -   Common Sheep color is black
        -   Uncommon Sheep colors are light gray, light blue, blue and cyan
        -   There is a rare chance for a pink Sheep to spawn
    -   Warm Biomes:
        -   Common Sheep color is brown
        -   Uncommon Sheep colors are gray, yellow, orange and red
        -   There is a rare chance for a pink Sheep to spawn

## Changes

-   A Bush only drops when broken with Shears or a Silk Touch tool and is replaceable when building
-   The look of both Mooshroom variants have been slightly updated to have an extruded snout
-   Ambient block sounds in Desert, Badlands and Pale Garden which are only used for ambience have been moved from "Blocks" to "Ambient/Environment" category
-   Cartographer and Wandering Trader has tweaks to their trades
-   Camels now spawn in Deserts
-   Bundles can now be found in some of the chests in villages
-   The breaking sound for grass sound type has been lowered affecting all blocks using this sound

### Cartographer and Wandering Trader Trade Rebalance

## Cartographer Trades

-   Cartographers now sell 7 new maps each pointing to a different village or other structures in a different biome. These maps can help players who want to quickly find a specific location
-   Cartographers from different village types will sell a different range of maps and colored banners
-   Some prices and quantities have also been adjusted

![Cartographers now sell maps to structures in different biomes (villages in Desert, Plains, Savanna, Snowy Plains or Taiga, the Swamp Hut in a Swamp or the Jungle Temple in a Jungle). Cartographers in different biomes will have a different selection of these maps, available at Apprentice level. The previously existing maps to Trial Chambers and Ocean Monuments are available at Journeyman level. Colored banners are sold at Expert level and the range is different in different biomes. A Woodland Mansion map is guaranteed at Master level along with the globe banner pattern.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/25w07acartographertrades.jpg)

## Wandering Trader Trades

-   The Wandering Trader now has better prices, more trades and a larger amount of stock for many items
-   They will also now buy basic supplies from players, so it's possible to get some emeralds by helping them prepare for their next journey even if you don't feel like buying anything
-   The Wandering Trader will offer to buy two items from this list:
    -   Water Bottle
    -   Water Bucket
    -   Milk Bucket
    -   Fermented Spider Eye
    -   Baked Potato
    -   Hay Bale
-   Wandering Traders now have a chance of selling these items (in addition to their previous trades):
    -   Logs (Acacia, Birch, Dark Oak, Jungle, Oak, Spruce, Pale Oak or Cherry)
    -   Enchanted Iron Pickaxe
    -   Potion of Invisibility

![Each Wandering Trader has two buying trades (buying Water Bottle, Water Bucket, Milk Bucket, Spider Eye, 4 Baked Potatoes or a Hay Bale) which give emeralds in return. They also have two 'special offers' where they sell Ice, Gunpowder, an Enchanted Pickaxe or any type of Logs, and five normal offers which are similar to the trades they had before this update.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/25w07awanderingtradertrades.jpg)

### Shaders & Post-process Effects

> **Developer's Note**: _Although it is possible in Resource Packs, overriding Core Shaders is considered as unsupported and not an intended Resource Pack feature. These shaders exist as part of the internal implementation of the game, and as such, may change at any time as the game's internals evolve. We understand that overriding Core Shaders is used for very cool Resource Pack features, many of which lack supported alternatives. We would like to provide better, supported alternatives in the future._

-   Shader program definitions for core shaders and post-processing effects as JSON files have been removed
-   The shader programs themselves are still available and can be overridden
-   The post-processing effects are still configurable as JSON

#### Post-process Effect Definitions

-   The field `program` was replaced with `vertex_shader` and `fragment_shader`
    -   `<namespace>:<path>` will resolve to `assets/<namespace>/shaders/<path>.<vsh|fsh>`
-   `type` is now a required field for each `uniform`
    -   Possible values are currently `int`, `ivec3`, `float`, `vec2`, `vec3`, `vec4`, `matrix4`
-   `values` in each `uniform` is now optional
    -   Leaving it unset is not recommended and is used for runtime configuration of the blur effect
-   Leaving a uniform unspecified results in undefined behavior, you must specify each one that will be used by the shaders

### Item rendering

#### Item Display

-   `firstperson_lefthand` and `thirdperson_lefthand` transforms are now rendered the same as when held in hand

#### Item Entity

-   When on ground, model size is now taken into account when determining hovering motion
    -   That means that models should never clip into the block below, no matter what size they are
-   Positioning of items in an item stack on ground now depends on model size and model type
    -   If model depth (Z coordinate) is below 1/16th of a block, item is rendered as flat stack of items
    -   Otherwise model is rendered as a cluster of items offset in all directions around center
    -   Previously, flat stack rendering happened only for models with `builtin/generated` parent

# Minecraft Snapshot 25w06a

This week we have been contemplating existential questions like "What came first; the cold chicken or the blue egg?". It's time for the cold chicken and the warm chicken to make their way into snapshot 25w06a together with their respective colorful egg. In addition, pink cactus flowers and dry grass will now decorate deserts and badlands.

## New Features

-   Added Warm and Cold Chicken variants
-   Added Short Dry Grass and Tall Dry Grass
-   Added Cactus Flower block which can grow on Cactus blocks

### Farm Animal variants

-   Warm and cold variants have been added for Chicken
-   Existing Chicken variant has been renamed to temperate
-   The variant is determined by the biome they spawn in
-   Warm and cold biomes are the same for all animals with variants (i.e. Chicken, Pig, Cow)
-   Two new Egg items have been added for the warm and cold Chicken variants
    -   Blue Egg - The Egg that is laid by and can hatch cold Chicken variant
    -   Brown Egg - The Egg that is laid by and can hatch warm Chicken variant
-   Already existing Egg is laid by and can hatch temperate Chicken variant

### Short and Tall Dry Grass

-   Added two new types of grass: Short Dry Grass and Tall Dry Grass
-   Both are one block high, which makes Tall Dry Grass differ from Tall Grass which is two blocks high
-   Both generate in the Desert and Badlands
-   Both can be placed on types of Sand, Terracotta and Dirt blocks like the Dead Bush
-   Both can be bone mealed
    -   Using Bone Meal on Short Dry Grass grows it into a Tall Dry Grass
    -   Using Bone Meal on Tall Dry Grass places a neighbouring Short Dry Grass next to the block if possible
-   Both can be used in the Composter
-   Sheep can eat both to regrow its wool
-   Both can be used as fuel for smelting

### Cactus Flower

-   Cactus Flower is a new type of flower which has a chance of generating on cactuses in Deserts and Badlands

-   Cactus Flowers have a chance of growing on Cactus blocks
    -   If a Cactus is one or two blocks high the Cactus Flower has a 10% chance to grow instead of the Cactus getting higher
    -   If a Cactus is three blocks or higher the Cactus Flower has a 25% chance to grow
    -   Cactus Flowers will only grow if they have space on all four sides
-   Cactus Flowers can be used in the Composter
-   A Cactus Flower can be used to craft 1 Pink Dye

## Changes

-   Any block in the simulation distance of a player or loaded by another source of chunk loading (such as Ender Pearls) may now receive random ticks, instead of just 8 chunks around players
    -   For example: if a chunk is loaded by an Ender Pearl or is in the spawn chunks, crops are able to grow, Ice can melt, Snow can fall, and a Cauldron can be filled by rain
    -   Mob spawning, Lava spreading fire, and Lightning strikes still occur in the previous radius of 8 chunks around players
-   Fire will no longer burn or spread if no player is within 8 chunks
-   Tooltips for Fireworks and Crossbows now show a compact form of multiple repeated stars or projectiles that are identical

### Firefly Bush

Conditions for The Firefly Bush playing ambient sounds have changed. It now plays when all of the following conditions are met:

-   it's night

### Chicken Variants

-   Chicken variants can be data-driven by adding entries to `data/<namespace>/chicken_variant/<id>.json`
-   This feature is experimental
-   Fields in file:
    -   `model` - one of: `normal`, `cold`
    -   `asset_id` - namespaced id for this variant asset, resolves to `assets/<namespace>/textures/<path>.png`
    -   `spawn_conditions` - field described in uniform variant selection above

## Resource Pack Version 51

-   New and updated Chicken textures
-   Added textures for new Blue Egg and Brown Egg items

# Minecraft Snapshot 25w04a

It's time for another snapshot! To kick things off, we are reverting the fixes for [MC-271065](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-271065) and [MC-152728](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-152728).

This week's snapshot also comes with a whole slew of datapack updates, including new components and item model capabilities. If you like to play around with datapacks, you will definitely find something fun in this update!

As always, we're keen to get your feedback on these new features at [feedback.minecraft.net](https://feedback.minecraft.net) and you can report any bugs at [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com)! Here's what's new this week:

## New Features

-   Added language support for Kyrgyz

## Changes

-   Reverted fixes:
    
    -   [MC-271065](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-271065) - Diagonal movement is not normalized when crouching or using certain items
    -   [MC-152728](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-152728) - The player continues sprinting when performing actions that slow them down
    
    > **Developer's Note**: _After consideration, we have decided to revert both fixed bugs. While we do want to revisit these mechanics in the future, it's clear that these recent fixes alone didn't quite hit the mark and caused too many negative side-effects for parkour, speedbridging, and movement in general_
    
-   Crossbows will now show all charged projectiles in their tooltip instead of just the first
    -   All charged projectiles will also add their entire tooltip as a subsection, instead of only Fireworks
-   All container items with stored contents, such as a Chest picked with Ctrl+Pick Block, will now list the first 4 items in their tooltip just like Shulker Boxes

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 64
-   The Resource Pack version is now 49

## Data Pack Versions 64

-   The `potion` entity type has been split into `splash_potion` and `lingering_potion`
-   Filled Maps without any `map_id` component no longer show an 'Unknown Map' tooltip (invalid IDs will still produce this tooltip)
-   Trim pattern and trim material items are no longer specified in the trim registries, but instead in the recipes and items respectively
-   Field `background` in advancement definition no longer contains `textures/` prefix and `.png` suffix
-   Changes to entity variant definitions
    -   Cat and Frog variants are now data-driven
    -   Added uniform way to define variant selection rules

### Commands

-   SNBT literals now accept heterogenous lists

### SNBT changes

-   SNBT (textual representation of NBT-like data) has been expanded to accept heterogenous lists, i.e. ones where elements are not of the same type
-   NBT format is not changed
    -   If SNBT command argument transforms value to NBT (like arguments of `/data` or `/summon`), lists might be transformed to bypass NBT constraints
    -   Example transform: `['a', {'b':3}]` is stored as `[{'':'a'},{'b':3}]`
    -   This transform is not reversed by `/data`

> **Developer's Note**: _Internally, in new code we read and write data in both JSON and NBT formats. This change makes sure that we don't have to worry about NBT limitations when it comes to lists. We have chosen to not expand NBT itself to avoid breaking existing external tools._

### Tags

#### Entity Tags

-   Added `#can_wear_horse_armor` - entity that can hold horse armor in their body slot

#### Damage Type Tags

-   Renamed `#bypasses_shield` to `#bypasses_blocking`

#### Cat Variant Tags

-   Removed `#default_spawns` and `#full_moon_spawns`

-   Selection process:
    -   Every variant field `spawn_conditions` that contain a list of entries
    -   Every entry has a condition and an integer priority
    -   Conditions for all variants for given entity type are evaluated for position where entity is being spawned
    -   Entries with priority lower than maximum priority of remaining entries are removed
    -   Game randomly picks one entry out of remaining ones
    -   If no conditions are remaining, variant remains unchanged from default
-   Entry format:
    -   `priority` - integer
    -   `condition` - optional structure
        -   Fields:
            -   `type` - see below for values

# Minecraft Snapshot 25w03a

This week's snapshot comes with a huge update to game tests! The game tests system is now accessible through data packs with the new test command. You can now run block based tests with the new test block or set up even more versatile test from code in mods.

Happy testing!

## Changes

-   Leaf Litter can be used in the Composter
-   Saddles equipped onto Pigs or Striders will now maintain properties such as custom name when dropped

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 63
-   The Resource Pack version is now 48
-   New entry point `net.minecraft.gametest.Main` is present in the server jar
    -   Automatically starts a server and runs all available game tests

### Game Test Main

This new entry point automatically starts a server, runs all available game test and then exists.

Options:

-   `--help` - Shows usage information
-   `--packs <path>` - Set a folder of datapacks to include in the world
    -   Any zip file or folder with a `pack.mcmeta` file is included
-   `--report <path>` - Exports results in a junit-like XML report at the given path
-   `--tests <selection>` - Specify which tests to run with a selection - a wildcard expression matching namespace test instance IDs
    -   If omitted, or used with an empty ID, runs all tests
-   `--universe <path>` - The path to where the test server world will be created
    -   Any existing folder will be replaced
    -   Default: `gametestserver`
-   `--verify <boolean>` - Enables test verification
    -   Runs the tests specified with `test` or `testNamespace` 100 times for each 90 degree rotation step
    -   Default: `false`

Example usage: `java -DbundlerMainClass="net.minecraft.gametest.Main" -jar server.jar --packs mytestpacks`

## Data Pack Versions 63

-   The Game Tests system is now accessible through data packs and for mods
-   Entity variants are now set and queried with components
-   Added `saddle` equipment slot, driven by the `equippable` component - Only mobs that normally support saddles will support riding and rendering of the saddle - Items in the `saddle` slot can apply attribute modifiers as with other equipment

### Game Tests

The Game Tests system is a new integrated system for testing aspects of the game. Each test is an asset defining some parameters for how the test gets executed, combined with a saved structure file containing a base setup.

Generally, the test framework expects to run tests in a separate superflat world.

#### Test Instances

Test instances are defined in the registry `test_instance`. They're small assets defining a test to run.

Fields:

-   `environment`: Namespaced ID of the test environment to run this test as part of
-   `structure`: The namespaced ID of the structure to use for the test
-   `max_ticks`: A positive integer representing the maximum number of ticks allowed to pass before the test is considered timed out
-   `setup_ticks`: Optional non-negative integer (default: `0`) representing a number of ticks to wait after placing the structure before starting the test
-   `required`: Optional boolean (default `true`) - whether the test is considered required to pass for the full test suite to pass
-   `rotation`: Optional rotation to apply to the test structure
    -   One of `none` (default), `clockwise_90`, `180` and `counterclockwise_90`
-   `manual_only`: Optional boolean (default `false`), set to `true` for tests that are not included as part of automated test runs
-   `sky_access`: Whether the test needs clear access to the sky
    -   By default (`false`), tests are enclosed in barrier blocks - if set to `true`, the top is left open
-   `max_attempts`: Number of attempts to run the test (default `1`)
-   `required_successes`: Number of attempts that must succeed for the test to be considered successful (default `1`)
-   `type`: The type of test - one of `block_based` and `function`

##### Function Tests

Function tests rely on built-in functions to run a test and indicate success or failure. They have one additional field:

-   `function`: The namespaced ID of the Test Function to run

See the "Using the Game Test Framework from Code" changelog section for more information.

##### Block Based Tests

Block based tests use Test Blocks in the test structure to run the test and indicate success or failure.

#### Test Environments

Test Environments are a way to group up tests and give them the right preconditions to run. A Test Environment is an asset in the `test_environment` registry. Each Test Environment definition has a `type` field that determines its setup:

-   `all_of` definitions apply the setup from several sub-definitions in the `definitions` field
-   `function` definitions use mcfunction files as setup and teardown
    -   `setup`: Optional namespaced ID of the mcfunction to use for setup, if any
    -   `teardown`: Optional namespaced ID of the mcfunction to use for teardown, if any
-   `game_rules`: definitions set any number of game rules
    -   `bool_rules`: A list of boolean game rules to set and the value to set
    -   `int_rules`: A list of integer game rules to set and the value to set
    -   Each rule is an object with two fields:
        -   `rule`: The exact name of the rule to set
        -   `value`: The value to set
    -   Game rules are reset to their default values after the test environment has completed
-   `weather` definitions sets the weather state
    -   `weather`: The weather to set - one of `clear`, `rain` and `thunder`
-   `time_of_day` definitions set a given time of day
    -   `time`: The time of day to set in number of ticks, as a non-negative integer

The game provides a single, empty Test Environment by default: `minecraft:default`.

#### Test Blocks

The Test Block is a block used for implementing a block-based tests. It has four modes:

-   `start`: Triggers a redstone pulse when the test starts
-   `log`: Logs a message to the log file when powered by redstone
-   `fail`: Fails the test when powered by redstone
-   `accept`: Completes the test when powered by redstone

Block-based tests are required to have at least one `start` block and one `accept` block in the structure.

#### The `test` Command

The `test` command is a new command used to create and run tests.

Syntax:

    test clearall [<radius>]
    test clearthat
    test clearthese
    
    test create <test> [<width>] [<height> <depth>]
    
    test locate <selector>
    
    test resetclosest
    test reseetthese
    test resetthat
    
    test pos [<variable>]
    
    test run <selector> [<numberOfTimes>] [<untilFailed>] [<rotationSteps>] [<testsPerRow>]
    test runclosest [<numberOfTimes>] [<untilFailed>]
    test runfailed [<numberOfTimes>] [<untilFailed>] [<rotationSteps>] [<testsPerRow>]
    test runmultiple <selector> [<amount>]
    test runthat [<numberOfTimes>] [<untilFailed>]
    test runthese [<numberOfTimes>] [<untilFailed>]
    
    test stop
    
    test verify <tests>
    

Parameters:

-   `radius`: The radius to clear tests within
-   `test`: The namespaced ID of a test
-   `selector`: A wildcard-enabled selector for test IDs
    -   Supports `*` and `?` for matching namespaced IDs
    -   If namespace is not supplied, defaults to `minecraft`
    -   Examples:
        -   `*:*` - matches all IDs
        -   `*` - matches everything in the `minecraft` namespace
        -   `custom:folder/*_test_?` - matches IDs in the `folder` folder of the `custom` namespace, with a prefix followed by `_test_` followed by a single valid character
-   `width`: The width of the test structure - if omitted, `5` is used
-   `height`: The height of the test structure - if omitted, the width is used
-   `depth`: The depth of the test structure - if omitted, the width is used
-   `variable`: The variable name to include in the copied code snippet
-   `numberOfTimes`: The number of times to repeat each test - if omitted, `1` is ued
-   `untilFailed`: Boolean (default `false`) noting that the test should be stopped as soon as one iteration fails
-   `rotationSteps`: Number of extra 90 degree steps to apply to the test - if omitted, `0` is used
-   `testsPerRow`: Number of tests to place per row in a grid layout - if omitted, `8` is used

##### `test clear*`

These subcommands clear the structures and blocks associated with the selected tests.

##### `test create`

This subcommand creates a test setup in the current location for the given test, preparing for a structure of the given size. This gives a starting point for creating the structure for the test.

##### `test locate`

Attempts to locate the given test. Note that only loaded chunks are searched.

##### `test reset*`

These subcommands reset the structures for the selected tests, removing any surrounding barriers and placing the structure in from scatch.

##### `test pos`

Shows the local coordinates to the block pointed at in the test. If the optional variable name is specified, this variable name is used in a code fragment obtained by clicking on the coordinates in the output message.

##### `test run*`

Runs one or more tests. If multiple tests are run at once, they are placed in a grid and run in parallel, although only up to a certain limit. Beyond that limit, tests are run in rounds where each round completes before any tests from the next round are started.

For each test, loads the given structure and runs the associated test. Each test location will have a beacon beam showcasing the test status.

-   Gray beacon = in progress
-   Red = fail (required test)
-   Orange = fail (optional test)
-   Green = success

If a test fails, the error is shown on a lectern book and an overlay.

Note that Game Tests are designed to run on standard superflat worlds. The area around each test is replaced with stone when it runs, and the running test is encased in barrier blocks.

##### `test stop`

This stops all running tests. Note that gameplay events triggered by tests may still remain.

##### `test verify*`

Verifies one or more tests by running multiple instances of the same test.

#### Test Instance Blocks

To run a test in a world, a Test Instance Block is used. This type of block represents the test as placed in the world and is used to interact with that test, to save the structure, reset or run the test.

Using the `test` command to run or create a test will also place a Test Instance Block to control that test.

#### Using the Game Test Framework from Code

The Game Test Framework can also be used from code in a more versatile manner than block-based tests. For this to work, you need to mod the game to add your test functions to the `test_function` registry (`Registries.TEST_FUNCTION`).

Hook into some startup method (pre-registry bootstrap) to add your loader - call `TestFunctionLoader.registerLoader()` with an implementation of `TestFunctionLoader`. Your implementation can then use the provided `register` consumer to register test functions with their namespaced IDs. This namespaced ID can then be referenced in a `function` type Test Instance.

A test function is a `Consumer<GameTestHelper>`, using that `GameTestHelper` instance to manipulate the world and make assertions about the state of the resulting world.

The helper can be used to summon mobs, set blocks, query for blocks and entities and assert the state of the test. Most `GameTestHelper` methods take test-local coordinates, which you can also find using `/test pos`.

Example code that might go along with a test structure with a locked hopper containing a cod, pointed into a furnace:

    public void furnace_smelts_item(final GameTestHelper helper) {
        helper.setBlock(0, 4, 0, Blocks.AIR);
        helper.succeedWhen(() -> helper.assertContainerContainsSingle(new BlockPos(0, 0, 0), Items.COOKED_COD));
    }
    

More complicated setups will often use `helper.startSequence()` to model sequences of events that must happen.

As opposed to block-based tests, function tests failing will often produce more helpful error messages including the location of whatever failed and what was expected at that location.

### Commands

-   The `horse.saddle` item slot has been renamed to `saddle`, and now supports any entity that can equip a Saddle

### Text Component Data Format

#### Hover Events

-   For the `show_text` action:
    -   `text` field has been renamed to `value`

### Tags

#### Entity Tags

-   Added `#can_equip_saddle` - entities that can be equipped with a Saddle
    -   Note: this does not mean that the Saddle will function, just that it can be equipped into the saddle slot

### Entity Data

-   The `ArmorItems`, `HandItems`, and `body_armor_item` fields have been merged into an `equipment` field
    -   Format: map between equipment slot type and item stack
        -   Valid equipment slots: `head`, `chest`, `legs`, `feet`, `mainhand`, `offhand`, `body`, `saddle`
    -   If not specified or removed, the entity will have no equipment
    -   e.g. `equipment:{chest:{id:'minecraft:diamond_chestplate'}}`
    -   This affects all mobs and Armor Stands, but Players are unaffected
-   The data format of saddles has been unified between mobs such as Horses and Pigs, becoming a new kind of equipment slot (and stored in the `equipment.saddle` field)
    -   This is a pure rename from the previous `SaddleItem` in Horse-like mobs
    -   This also replaces the boolean `Saddle` flag from Pigs and Striders
    -   The Saddle dropping on death is now affected by the `drop_chances` field, as with other equipment slots
-   The `FallDistance` field has been changed from float to double and is now called `fall_distance`

### Item Components

#### `weapon` component

-   `damage_per_attack` field was renamed to `item_damage_per_attack`

#### `equippable` Component

-   Can now apply to `saddle` slot
-   Any mob can now have equipment added in the `body` slot as long as the component allows it (`allowed_entities`)
-   Added new optional field: `equip_on_interaction` (boolean)
    -   If `true`, players can equip this item onto a target mob by right-clicking it (as long as this item can be equipped on the target at all)
    -   The item will not be equipped if the target already has an item in the relevant slot
    -   If not specified, defaults to `false`

#### Entity variant components

-   Entities now have a set of components for configuring variants and other aspects of apperance
-   If those components are present on spawning item (like spawn eggs, mob buckets, `minecraft:painting`, `minecraft:item_frame`), they will be applied to new entity
-   Components are currently not restored when spawn egg is picked from existing entity
-   New components:
    -   `villager/variant` - one of `desert`, `jungle`, `plains`, `savanna`, `snow`, `swamp`, `taiga`
    -   `wolf/variant` - namespaced id from `wolf_variant` registry
    -   `wolf/collar` - one of 16 dye colors

    -   `rabbit/variant` - one of `brown`, `white`, `black`, `white_splotched`, `gold`, `salt`, `evil`
    -   `pig/variant` - namespaced id from `pig_variant` registry
    -   `frog/variant` - namespaced id from `frog_variant` registry
    -   `horse/variant` - one of `white`, `creamy`, `chestnut`, `brown`, `black`, `gray`, `dark_brown`
    -   `painting/variant` - namespaced id from `painting_variant` registry
    -   `llama/variant` - one of `creamy`, `white`, `brown`, `gray`

### Predicates

#### Entity predicates

-   New optional field has been added to entity predicate: `components`
    -   When present, predicate will match contents of entity components (similarily to field `components` on item predicate that works on item stacks)
    -   Format: map of component type key to matching component values
-   Following entity sub-predicates have been removed and replaced with combination of `components` predicate and variant entity components:
    -   `minecraft:axolotl`

# Minecraft Snapshot 25w02a

It's the first snapshot Wednesday of 2025, and we have some fun new features to kick off the new year. This snapshot adds new ambient features to the game, including wildflowers, leaf litter, and falling leaves. Pigs are getting two new variants: you may venture into the colder biomes to find the cold pig, or head for sunnier spots to meet its counterpart – the warm pig! Lodestones are also becoming easier to craft, making them more accessible in the early game. Now you'll only need an iron ingot with your chiseled stone bricks.

## New Features

-   Added new falling leaves particles to Leaf blocks without particles
-   Added cold and warm variants for the Pig
-   Added Wildflowers block

    -   All these behaviors are no longer affected by weather or dimension brightness

### Lodestone Changes

-   Lodestones can now be found as loot at Ruined Portals in the Overworld or Nether

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 62
-   The Resource Pack version is now 47

## Data Pack Version 62

-   Changes to commands
-   Updated data format of Text Components
-   `structure_block` in the `load` mode has now a new option: `Strict Placement`
    -   If set to `false`, the blocks in the placed structure will not trigger block updates, block entity side effects, or shape updates
-   The `Owner` field of tamed animals is no longer restricted to referencing Players
-   Updated data format of equipment drop chances in entity data
-   Added data-driven registry for pig variants
-   Added `pig` entity sub-predicate for matching pig variants

### Commands

-   Text Components in commands such as `/tellraw` or `/title` are now specified with SNBT instead of JSON
-   Text Style in the `/scoreboard` command when specifying the `styled` number format is also now specified with SNBT instead of JSON
-   The behavior of `setblock` and `fill` commands have changed in how they handle block entity data:
    -   If the block entity data is not specified, and the existing block has data, the block entity data will be preserved
    -   If the block entity data is specified, the block entity data will be set to the specified value
    -   To clear the block entity data explicitly, you must now specify the block entity data as `{}`
    -   The operation is now successful if either the block state changed or the block entity data changed
-   `fill`, `clone`, `setblock` and `place template` accept a new option: `strict`
    -   If specified, the command will place blocks as-is without triggering block updates and shape updates
-   The `replace` option in the `fill` command is no longer terminal, and can be followed with additional options
-   New syntax for commands to use the new `strict` option, and more flexible use of `replace`:
    -   `fill <from> <to> <block> keep`
    -   `fill <from> <to> <block> [replace <filter>]? [strict|destroy|hollow|outline]?`
    -   `clone [from <sourceDimension>]? <begin> <end> [to <targetDimension>]? <destination> [strict]? [[replace|masked|filtered <filter>] [force|move|normal]?]?`
    -   `setblock <pos> <block> [destroy|keep|replace|strict]?`
    -   `place template <template> [<pos> [<rotation> [<mirror> [<integrity> [<seed> [strict]?]?]?]?]?]?`

### Text Component Data Format

-   Text Components are no longer stored as JSON wrapped by a string
-   The format itself is the same as before, but inlined directly into the outer structure
-   For example, the item component `minecraft:custom_name="{\"text\":\"Renamed item\"}"` will become `minecraft:custom_name={text:'Renamed item'}`
-   This includes Text Components passed as arguments to commands such as `/tellraw` or `/title`
    -   For example, `/tellraw @s "\"text\":\"Hello world\""` may become `/tellraw @s {text:'Hello world'}`
-   Note: in the case where Text Components are embedded in NBT, no distinction exists between boolean and integer types
    -   To pass boolean arguments to translations, you must use the string form
-   For Text Components with the `nbt` type and `interpret` set to `true`, Text Components will be parsed from the given NBT directly rather than converting to string and parsing as JSON
-   The format of hover and click events has been updated

#### Hover Events

-   The `hoverEvent` field has been renamed to `hover_event`
-   The legacy `value` field (which was parsed from a rendered text component) is no longer supported
-   For the `show_text` action:
    -   `contents` field has been renamed to `text`
    -   e.g. `{action:'show_text',contents:'Hello world'}` becomes `{action:'show_text',text:'Hello world'}`
-   For the `show_item` action:
    -   The `contents` field has been inlined
    -   e.g. `{action:'show_item',contents:{id:'minecraft:stick',count:2}}` becomes `{action:'show_item',id:'minecraft:stick',count:2}`
    -   If contents was specified only as an item id, it is replaced with the full format and inlined
    -   e.g. `{action:'show_item',contents:'minecraft:stick'}` becomes `{action:'show_item',id:'minecraft:stick'}`
-   For the `show_entity` action:
    -   The `contents` field has been inlined
    -   The `id` field has been renamed to `uuid`
    -   The `type` field has been renamed to `id`
    -   e.g. `{action:'show_entity',contents:{id:[I;0,0,0,0],type:'minecraft:pig'}}` becomes `{action:'show_entity',uuid:[I;0,0,0,0],id:'minecraft:pig'}`

#### Click Events

-   The `clickEvent` field has been renamed to `click_event`
-   For the `open_url` action:
    -   The `value` field has been renamed to `url`
    -   The click event will no longer parse if not a valid URI with either `https://` or `http://` schemes, instead of simply not working
    -   e.g. `{action:'open_url',value:'https://minecraft.net'}` becomes `{action:'open_url',url:'https://minecraft.net'}`
-   For the `run_command` action:
    -   The `value` field has been renamed to `command`
    -   The click event will no longer parse if the command contains disallowed characters, instead of simply not working
    -   It is no longer required that the specified `command` field has a `/` prefix
    -   e.g. `{action:'run_command',value:'/say Hi'}` becomes `{action:'run_command',command:'/say Hi'}`
-   For the `suggest_command` action:
    -   The `value` field has been renamed to `command`
    -   The click event will no longer parse if the command contains disallowed characters, instead of simply not working
    -   e.g. `{action:'suggest_command',value:'/help'}` becomes `{action:'suggest_command',command:'/help'}`
-   For the `change_page` action:
    -   The `value` field has been renamed to `page`
    -   The `page` value now requires a positive integer instead of a string
    -   e.g. `{action:'change_page',value:'1'}` becomes `{action:'change_page',page:1}`
-   The `copy_to_clipboard` format is unchanged

### Tags

#### Block Tags

### Entity Data

-   The `ArmorDropChances`, `HandDropChances`, and `body_armor_drop_chance` fields have been merged into a `drop_chances` field
    -   Format: map between equipment slot type and chance value
        -   Valid equipment slots: `head`, `chest`, `legs`, `feet`, `mainhand`, `offhand`, `body`
    -   If not specified or removed, chances will be assumed as default (`0.085f`)
    -   e.g. `drop_chances:{chest:0.1,feet:1.0}`
-   Drop chances with a default value will no longer be stored, and the `drop_chances` field is removed entirely if all defaults
-   Area Effect Clouds have a new field: `potion_duration_scale` (float)
    -   If not specified, defaults to `1.0`
    -   The duration of the potion effect applied is scaled by this factor
    -   Area Effect Clouds created by Lingering Potions will have a scale of `0.25`

### Pig Variants

-   Pig variants can be data-driven by adding entries to `data/<namespace>/pig_variant/<id>.json`
-   This feature is experimental
-   Fields in file:
    -   `model` - one of: `normal`, `cold`
    -   `texture` - texture id for this variant, resolves to `assets/<namespace>/textures/<path>.png`
    -   `biome` - single entry, list or a tag describing biomes in which this variant natually spawns
        -   If not specified, this variant will only be selected if no other variant matches the current biome

### Recipes

#### `crafting_transmute` Recipe Type

-   The `result` field now supports specifying a count and a components patch to apply to the result
-   The components patch is applied to the final transmuted item
-   The new format is an object with fields:
    -   `id` - item id
    -   `count` - positive integer (default: `1`)
    -   `components` - a component patch object (default: empty)
    -   e.g. `"result": {"id": "minecraft:stick", "count": 3, "components": {"!minecraft:damage": {}, "minecraft:enchantment_glint_override": {}}}`
-   The field can still be defined as before as an inline item id (e.g. `"result": "minecraft:stick"`)

### Item Components

#### New `weapon` component

    -   e.g. `weapon={damage_per_attack:2}`

#### New `potion_duration_scale` component

-   When present, for items that have the `potion_contents` component, the duration of the applied effects will be scaled by this factor
-   This also applies to `custom_effects` in the `potion_contents` component, unlike the previous hardcoded scaling factor
-   If not specified, defaults to `1.0`
-   Format: non-negative float
    -   e.g. `potion_duration_scale=0.25`

# Minecraft 1.21.4 Pre-Release 1

The first pre-release of Minecraft 1.21.4 is now available. Today's update and for the remainder of the 1.21.4 cycle, you will mostly see bug fixes and tweaks. In addition to that, pre-releases don't follow the regular snapshot cadence of releasing only on Wednesdays, so keep an eye out for the next pre-release.

As always, a big thank you to the community for your feedback, bugs reported, and awesome ideas throughout the snapshot series. Let the pre-releases commence!

## Technical Changes

-   The Resource Pack version is now 46
-   Similarly to block items, Spawn Eggs for entities that could execute operator-only commands now have a warning in tooltip

## Resource Pack Version 46

-   Added a way of suppressing first-person hand animation on item change for specific models
-   Unifont has been updated to 16.0.01

### Item models

-   A new field has been added to the client-side item info format (i.e. files in `/assets/*/items/*.json`)
    -   `hand_animation_on_swap` - boolean field describing if down-and-up animation should be played in first-person view when item stack is changed (either type, count or components), default: `true`
        -   only value from new item is taken into account
        -   does not control "pop" animation in GUI when item is picked or changes count

##### Renamed property `minecraft:holder_type` to `minecraft:context_entity_type`

**Developer's Note**: _Context entities were initially used only for compasses and clocks, which means that type is available only in rendering contexts where those items would show correct reading (see MC-186797 and related bugs). The name change has been made to better reflect that._

##### Added `minecraft:context_dimension` property

-   Returns the ID of the dimension in context, if any

# Minecraft Snapshot 24w44a

We're back in the shipping room to serve you the first snapshot release for Minecraft: Java Edition 1.21.4! It's coming in hot with some new pale goodies in the form of Eyeblossoms and Resin, two new additions to the Pale Garden biome. You'll also find that leaves will now fall from the Pale Oak trees in said biome, something we hope will crank up the eerie atmosphere even further. In addition to that, this release is also bringing a collection of technical updates and bug fixes.

Happy mining!

## New Features

The `winter_drop` is no longer an experiment.

### Added Eyeblossoms

Eyeblossoms are new flowers that generate in the Pale Garden biome. Unique features:

-   They exist in two variants: Closed and Open Eyeblossom
-   Eyeblossoms transition between the two variants based on the time of day
    -   During the night, Eyeblossoms will become Open
    -   During the day, they will become Closed
    -   In dimensions that do not have a day/night cycle, they will remain as-is
    -   When transitioning, flowers will emit a particle effect
-   Eyeblossoms planted on the ground will communicate with each other, helping each other to open or close
-   Open Eyeblossoms have glowing eyes during the night
-   Eyeblossoms can be obtained by bonemealing the grass in the Pale Garden biome
-   Bees get poisoned when they touch Eyeblossoms
-   Bees can be tempted by Eyeblossoms, but they get poisoned on player interaction instead of typical breeding/growing behaviour
-   Suspicious Stew made from Eyeblossom will have Blindness or Nausea effect depending on the variant
-   Gray or Orange Dye can be crafted from Closed and Open Eyeblossoms respectively
-   Wandering Trader can sell Open Eyeblossoms

### Added Resin Clump, Block of Resin, Resin Brick, and a family of Resin Bricks blocks

-   Attacking a Creaking will cause its Creaking Heart to exude 2 to 3 Resin Clumps
-   Resin Clump spawns on the sides of Pale Oak Logs that are close, and are connected to the Creaking Heart
-   Creaking Heart is on cooldown and cannot produce more Resin Clumps for 5 seconds after an attack
-   Resin Clump can be used as a material for armor trimming
-   Block of Resin is a storage block for Resin Clumps
-   Resin Clumps can be smelted into Resin Brick items
-   Resin Brick items can be crafted into Resin Bricks, Resin Brick Slabs, Resin Brick Stairs, Resin Brick Walls, and then Chiseled Resin Bricks
-   Resin Clump and Resin Block does not require a tool and are mined instantly
-   The proper tool for Resin Bricks family of blocks is a pickaxe
-   Resin Clumps can be found in the Woodland Mansion chest loot

## Changes

-   The panorama has been updated
-   Sword is no longer efficient to break Moss Carpet. The proper tool for Moss Carpet remains the Hoe
-   Bees are now withered on player interactions with Wither Roses instead of typical breeding/growing behavior

### Required tools for drops

> **Developer's Note**: _We made it so any block that drops when its support is broken will also drop when mined with any tool. It seemed unfair that breaking a block directly could destroy it if it was possible to obtain it with any tool just by breaking the block below!_

-   The following blocks that require support now always drop when broken with any tool: Bell, Lantern, Soul Lantern, all Copper Doors, Iron Door, Heavy Weighted Pressure Plate, Light Weighted Pressure Plate, Polished Blackstone Pressure Plate, and Stone Pressure Plate
-   The Brewing Stand now drops when broken with any tool
-   The Ender Chest now drops Obsidian when broken with an incorrect tool, instead of dropping nothing

### Pale Garden

-   Pale Garden has no music and if a player enters the biome while music is playing, the music will fade out

### Creaking Heart

-   Creaking Heart can be obtained by using a Silk Touch enchanted tool
-   Creaking Heart can be crafted with a Resin Block and Pale Oak Logs
-   Naturally placed Creaking Hearts drop 20-24 experience when broken by a player, with or without silk touch
-   Breaking a Creaking Heart block will drop a 1-3 Resin Clumps, and it is affected by Fortune enchantment

### Pale Oak Tree

-   Pale Oak Leaves have a chance to spawn leaf particles if exposed on the bottom side
-   Player grown Pale Oak trees grow without any decorations
-   Naturally generated Pale Oak trees have Pale Hanging Moss hanging from the foliage, Pale Moss patches on the ground, and Creaking Heart blocks can generate in them
-   Wandering Trader can sell Pale Oak Saplings

### Pale Moss Block

-   Wandering Trader can sell a Pale Moss Block

### Pale Hanging Moss

-   Pale Hanging Moss breaks instantly when mined
-   Pale Hanging Moss requires shears or silk touch tools to be obtained
-   Wandering Trader can sell Pale Hanging Moss

### Creaking mob

-   Creaking melee attacks deal 3 points of damage (1.5 hearts)
-   Illagers are scared of Creaking and will run away from them

The following changes apply for naturally spawning Creaking:

-   Creaking reacts only to damage caused by mobs and projectiles, by swaying in place
-   Creaking ignores Cactus, Sweet Berry Bushes and Powder Snow damage and can now walk through/over them
-   Creaking has a twitching animation
-   Is fire-resistant
-   Creaking Heart decides to remove or replace the connected Creaking when:
    -   It turns day
    -   The Creaking is too far away from the Creaking Heart
    -   A player intersects with the Creaking for a few seconds

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 58
-   The Resource Pack version is now 43
-   Removed the `winter_drop` feature flag and built-in data pack

## Data Pack Version 58

-   `trail` particle has a new required field: `duration`
    -   Indicates, in ticks, how long the particle will take to fly from the start to the target
-   `simple_block` feature type has a new optional field: `schedule_tick`
    -   If set to `true`, the block will be scheduled to tick
-   biome effects have a new format for `music` using a weighted list
    -   The list can be empty indicating no music should play in this biome
-   biome effects have a new optional field: `music_volume`
    -   The game will smoothly transition between the current music volume and the new volume when entering the biome

      "music": [
        {
          "data": {
            "max_delay": 24000,
            "min_delay": 12000,
            "replace_current_music": false,
            "sound": "minecraft:music.overworld.forest"
          },
          "weight": 1
        }
      ],
      "music_volume": 1.0,
    

-   Item blocks with `minecraft:block_entity_data` component will now set block entity data only if `id` tag matches type of placed block entity
    -   Additionally, a warning will be added to item tooltip if placing such item might directly or indirectly lead to command execution with high permission level

### Commands

-   Suggestions will now be shown for attribute modifier IDs existing on the target in the `attribute` command

#### `attribute` Command

New subcommand to reset the base value of an attribute to its default value for the target entity. If the attribute does not exist on the entity, the command will fail.

Syntax:

    attribute <target> <attribute> base reset 
    

Parameters:

-   `target`: The entity to update the attribute for
-   `attribute`: The attribute ID to update

### TNT Minecart Data

-   The `TNTFuse` field of TNT Minecarts has been renamed to `fuse`
-   Addeded optional field `explosion_speed_factor` that controls the amount of added damage depending on the speed of the Minecart
    -   Default value: `1.0`

### Text Components

Added optional `shadow_color` style field to Text Components, which overrides the shadow properties of text.

-   Format:
    -   A packed integer ARGB value (e.g. `-1`)
    -   An array of RGBA values (e.g. `[1, 1, 1, 1]`)
-   If specified as `0`, the shadow will never be displayed for this text
-   If specified as a non-zero value, the shadow will always be displayed with this color

    -   `chiseled_resin_bricks`

# Minecraft 1.21.2 Release Candidate 2

We were so worried that you had forgotten all about us over the weekend, so we're kicking this week off with a surprise second Release Candidate for 1.21.2! Let's hope this is (fingers crossed) the last one before the full release of Bundles of Bravery.

If no other critical issues are found, this will be the version for 1.21.2 that can be expected to be released later this week.

Happy mining!

# Minecraft Snapshot 24w40a

### Container Locks

# Minecraft Snapshot 24w37a

Hi everyone! In this snapshot we have fixed the bug with Ender Pearls not teleporting the player to the point of impact. Ender Pearls will now also load chunks when thrown. Happy mining!

## New Features

## Changes

-   Thrown Ender Pearls now load and tick chunks
-   Added language support for High Norwegian

### Ender Pearl Chunk Loading

-   Ender Pearls now ensure that the chunk they are in or travel into is always loaded and ticking
-   They also load chunks when crossing to a new dimension, so that they can always continue to travel
-   This ensures that Ender Pearls can always land, and makes cross dimensional Ender Pearl travelling more predictable
-   Ender Pearls now unload when a player logs out, and reappear whenever that player logs back in, similar to how mounts currently behave

### Mob Conversion Details

In last week's snapshot, we fixed a bug related to which data gets transferred between mobs when converted from one type to another (ex: zombie to drowned). This week, we have reverted a few of those changes (health, attributes, and loot tables are no longer transferred).

-   Here is a full list of tags, data, and other properties which get transferred when a mob is converted (only relevant for mobs that can have these properties):
    
    -   `AbsorptionAmount`
    -   `active_effects`
    -   `Age`
    -   `AngerTime`
    -   `AngryAt`
    -   `ArmorDropChances`
    -   `ArmorItems`
    -   `Brain.memories.minecraft:angry_at.ttl`
    -   `Brain.memories.minecraft:angry_at.value`
    -   `CanBreakDoors`
    -   `CanPickUpLoot`

    -   `Fire`
    -   `ForcedAge`
    -   `HandDropChances`
    -   `HandItems`
    -   `HurtByTimestamp`
    -   `HurtTime`
    -   `Invulnerable`
    -   `IsBaby`
    -   `Leash`
    -   `LeftHanded`
    -   `Motion`
    -   `NoAI`
    -   `NoGravity`
    -   `OnGround`
    -   `Passengers`
    -   `PersistenceRequired`
    -   `PortalCooldown`
    -   `Position`
    -   `RootVehicle`
    -   `Rotation`
    -   `Silent`
    -   `SleepingX`
    -   `SleepingY`
    -   `SleepingZ`
    -   `Tags`
    -   `Team`
-   Mobs that split into several mobs rather than converting from one type into another do not transfer the following properties:
    
    -   `ArmorDropChances`
    -   `ArmorItems`
    -   `fall_distance`
    -   `FallFlying`
    -   `HandDropChances`
    -   `HandItems`
    -   `HurtByTimestamp`
    -   `HurtTime`
    -   `Leash`
    -   `Motion`
    -   `OnGround`
    -   `Passengers`
    -   `Position`
    -   `Rotation`
    -   `SleepingX`
    -   `SleepingY`
    -   `SleepingZ`
-   Some properties mentioned in MC-88967 are intentionally not transferred in any conversion:
    
    -   Attributes
    -   Gossips
    -   Health
    -   Loot tables
    -   VillagerData
    -   Xp

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 53
-   Resource Pack version is now 38

## Data Pack Version 53

### Loot tables

-   Tool value (used for functions like `match_tool`) is now available for some additional loot table types
    -   `archaeology` - used brush
    -   `vault` - inserted key (not available when displaying items)
    -   `shearing` - shears
-   Chickens laying eggs is now controlled by a loot table found at `gameplay/chicken_lay`
-   Armadillos randomly dropping scutes is now controlled by a loot table found at `gameplay/armadillo_shed`

#### Hero of the Village Gift Loot Tables

-   The loot given by Villagers is now controlled by two additional loot tables:
    -   `gameplay/hero_of_the_village/unemployed_gift` - used if the Villager is unemployed
    -   `gameplay/hero_of_the_village/baby_gift` - used if the Villager is a baby

### Tags

#### Item Tags

-   `duplicates_allays`: Items that can be used to duplicate Allays when dancing
-   `panda_eats_from_ground`: Items that a Panda will pick up from the ground and eat
-   `brewing_fuel`: Items that can be used as fuel in a Brewing Stand

### Item Component Changes

#### `minecraft:fire_resistant` -> `minecraft:damage_resistant`

-   Has a new field: `types`, hash-prefixed damage type tag
    -   Items with this component, when in entity form, will be resistant to the damage types included in the tag
    -   This component also affects whether the equipped item will be damaged when the wearer is hurt by a given damage type

#### `minecraft:item_name`

-   Name provided by this component always has the lowest priority
    -   That means it will be overriden by components like `minecraft:potion_contents`

#### `minecraft:potion_contents`

-   Added optional string field `custom_name`
    -   When present, it will be used to generate containing stack name
    -   For example, if value is `foo` and item is `minecraft:lingering_potion`, the name of item will be translation of `item.minecraft.lingering_potion.effect.foo`

#### `minecraft:equippable`

-   Added the following fields
    -   `swappable`: boolean (default: `true`), whether the item can be equipped into the relevant slot by right-clicking
    -   `damage_on_hurt`: boolean (default: `true`), whether this item will be damaged when the wearing entity is damaged

#### Added `minecraft:death_protection`

-   If present, this item will protect the holder from dying by restoring a single health point
-   Format: object with fields
    -   `death_effects`: An optional list of effects that are applied when the item protects the holder
        -   These effects are the same as those specified by the `on_consume_effects` field in the `consumable` component

### Predicates

#### `salmon` entity sub-predicate

-   Added `minecraft:salmon` entity sub-predicate
-   Fields:
    -   `variant`: one of `small`, `medium`, `large`

### Advancements

#### Triggers

##### `minecraft:killed_by_crossbow` -> `minecraft:killed_by_arrow`

-   Will now trigger whenever an Arrow kills an entity, not just when fired from a Crossbow
-   Has a new optional Item Predicate field, `fired_from_weapon`
    -   Can be used to match the item used to shoot the arrow

## Resource Pack Version 38

### GUI Sprites

-   The appearance of a highlighted slot may now be customized by replacing sprites:
    -   `container/slot_highlight_front`: The sprite to render in front of highlighted slots
    -   `container/slot_highlight_back`: The sprite to render behind highlighted slots
-   Likewise, the appearance of a highlighted item within the Bundle can be customized with the following sprites:
    -   `container/bundle/slot_highlight_front`
    -   `container/bundle/slot_highlight_back`

# Minecraft Snapshot 24w36a

Hi everyone! In the most exciting Minecraft-related news of the day, we have a new movi- I mean snapshot coming your way! This week we are adding support for custom equipment with Data Packs and Resource Packs. We have also tweaked the Bundle so that you can empty a group of items when it's used in the hotbar. And as usual, we have included a bunch of bug fixes!

Happy mining!

## Known Issues

-   Ender Pearls will not teleport you to the right location

## Experimental Features

### Bundles

-   When a Bundle is used in the hotbar, one group of items is emptied at a time instead of everything being emptied at once

## Changes

-   Squid Spawn Eggs now only spawn adult Squids
    -   There is a 5% chance of Squids spawned in groups in the wild to be a baby
-   When a mob converts from one type to another (ex: Piglin to Zombified Piglin), the health of the converted mob is set to the same percentage of max health as the original mob had before conversion

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 52
-   Resource Pack version is now 37

## Data Pack Version 52

### Tags

#### Block Tags

-   `bats_spawnable_on`: Blocks that bats can spawn on

#### Item Tags

-   Added new tags to control which items can be used to repair various armor sets:
    -   `repairs_leather_armor`
    -   `repairs_iron_armor`
    -   `repairs_chain_armor`
    -   `repairs_gold_armor`
    -   `repairs_diamond_armor`
    -   `repairs_netherite_armor`
    -   `repairs_turtle_helmet`
    -   `repairs_wolf_armor`
-   `piglin_safe_armor`: Items that, when worn by a player, will cause Piglins to not get angry

### Changed Item Components

#### `minecraft:item_name`

This component is now always present on every item

### New Item Components

#### `minecraft:item_model`

-   Controls item model
-   Present on every item
-   Format: namespaced id
    -   `namespace:id` will reference model `/assets/<namespace>/models/item/<id>`

#### `minecraft:equippable`

-   If present, this item can be equipped by players in the selected slot
-   When right-clicking with an item with this component, it will be swapped into the appropriate slot
-   Format: object with fields
    -   `slot`: one of `head`, `chest`, `legs`, `feet`, `body`, `mainhand`, or `offhand`
    -   `equip_sound` (optional): Sound event to play when the item is equipped
        -   If not specified, the default armor equip sound will be played
    -   `model` (optional): namespaced ID of the equipment model to use when equipped
        -   These model definitions are loaded from Resource Packs
        -   If not specified, will fall back to rendering as the item itself when in the head slot (or no rendering if not applicable)
    -   `allowed_entities` (optional): Entity ID, Entity Tag, or list of Entity IDs to limit which entities can equip this item
        -   If not specified, any entity (that can wear this kind of equipment) is allowed to equip this item
    -   `dispensable`: boolean (default: `true`), whether the item can be equipped by using a Dispenser
        -   If the item type has special dispenser behavior, this will have no effect
    -   e.g. `equippable={slot:'chest',equip_sound:'item.armor.equip_chain'}`

#### `minecraft:glider`

-   If present, this item will allow players to glide (as with Elytra) when equipped
-   Format: empty object
    -   e.g. `glider={}`

#### `minecraft:tooltip_style`

-   If present, this item can use custom sprites for its tooltip background and frame
-   Format: namespaced ID for a tooltip style
    -   A tooltip style of `namespace:path` will use sprites with IDs:
        -   `<namespace>:tooltip/<path>_background` and `<namespace>:tooltip/<path>_frame`
    -   e.g. `tooltip_style='minecraft:special_sword'`

### Predicates

-   Added a new field in the Player sub-predicate, `input`, that can be used to detect which movement keys the player is pressing
-   If specified the predicate matches with the corresponding keybind that the player is pressing; it supports detecting the following input:
    -   `forward` : boolean (optional)
    -   `backward` : boolean (optional)
    -   `left` : boolean (optional)
    -   `right` : boolean (optional)
    -   `jump` : boolean (optional)
    -   `sneak` : boolean (optional)
    -   `sprint` : boolean (optional)

## Resource Pack Version 37

-   Introduced equipment models
-   Textures for entity equipment have been moved and renamed
-   The tooltip background and frame may now be customized by replacing sprites:
    -   `tooltip/background`: The background of the tooltip
    -   `tooltip/frame`: The frame appearing around the tooltip
    -   Items with a custom `tooltip_style` component will use sprites with IDs:
        -   `<namespace>:tooltip/<path>_background` and `<namespace>:tooltip/<path>_frame`
-   The `nine_slice` GUI sprite scaling mode has a new optional boolean property: `stretch_inner`
    -   If `true`, the inner parts of the texture (i.e. not the corners) will be stretched instead of tiled
    -   If not specified, defaults to `false` as before

### Item Models

-   All item models can now use the `broken` property in model overrides that was previously limited to just Elytra
    -   This will have a value of 1 if the item has 1 durability left, or 0 otherwise

### Custom Equipment Models

The appearance of equipment when equipped by players or certain mobs can now be customized by defining 'equipment models' in the Resource Pack.

-   Equipment model definitions are loaded from `assets/<namespace>/models/equipment/<path>.json`
    -   These can then be referenced by the `equippable` component with a model id of `namespace:path`
-   The model definition is an object with fields: `wolf_body`, `horse_body`, `llama_body`, `humanoid`, `humanoid_leggings`, `wings`
    -   All fields are optional, and can be used to specify a list of layers for the given model layer type
    -   Each field contains list of layer objects:
        -   `texture`: namespaced texture location for this layer
            -   `namespace:path` will resolve to `assets/<namespace>/textures/entity/equipment/<layer_type>/<path>.png`
        -   `dyeable`: object with fields (optional), specifying how this layer behaves when dyed (in the `dyeable` item tag, and has `dyed_color` component)
            -   `color_when_undyed`: rgb color int (optional)
            -   If specified, this layer will be tinted by the color contained in the `dyed_color` component
                -   If the item is not dyeable or not dyed, it will be tinted based on the color specified by `color_when_undyed`
                -   If `color_when_undyed` is not specified and the item is not dyed, the layer will be hidden
        -   `use_player_texture`: boolean (default: `false`), true if this layer texture should be overridden by a texture given by the player
            -   Only used for `wings` layers, which will override with the player's custom Elytra texture

A model definition specifying both player and horse armor layers might look like:

    {
      "layers": {
        "horse_body": [
          { "texture": "minecraft:iron" }
        ],
        "humanoid": [
          { "texture": "minecraft:iron" }
        ],
        "humanoid_leggings": [
          { "texture": "minecraft:iron" }
        ]
      }
    }
    

### Trims

-   All equippable items with an equipment model defined support rendering trims, based on the `trim` component
-   Trim textures will be loaded from the appropriate folder in the `textures/trims/entity` directory
    -   For example, armor with `wolf_body` layers will fetch trims from `textures/trims/entity/wolf_body`

### Moved Textures

-   All equipment-related textures have been moved to subfolders of the `textures/entity/equipment` directory
    -   Player armor textures have been moved to `textures/entity/equipment/humanoid` and `textures/entity/equipment/humanoid_leggings`
        -   `<material>_layer_1` textures have been renamed to `<material>`, and moved into the `humanoid` subdirectory
        -   `<material>_layer_2` textures have been renamed to `<material>`, and moved into the `humanoid_leggings` subdirectory
        -   `leather_layer_1_overlay` and `leather_layer_2_overlay` textures have been renamed to `leather_overlay` in their respective subdirectories
    -   `wolf_armor` and `wolf_armor_overlay` textures have moved to `textures/entity/equipment/wolf_body/` and have been renamed to `armadillo_scute` and `armadillo_scute_overlay` respectively
    -   `turtle_layer_1` has been renamed to `turtle_scute`
    -   Llama decor textures have been moved to `textures/entity/equipment/llama_body`
    -   Horse armor textures have been moved to `textures/entity/equipment/horse_body`
    -   The Elytra texture has been moved to `textures/entity/equipment/wings/elytra`
-   Armor trim textures have also been moved to match the folder structure of the regular `equipment` textures
    -   Textures in `textures/trims/models/armor` have been divided between `textures/trims/entity/humanoid` and `textures/trims/entity/humanoid_leggings`
    -   For leggings textures, the `_leggings` suffix is dropped

# Minecraft Snapshot 24w35a

Hello! In this week's snapshot we have addressed some important bugs related to village raid spawns, Bundles and Redstone.

Happy mining!

## Experimental Features

### Bundles

-   Selecting items in a Bundle is now only done by scrolling

> **Developer's Note**: _In previous snapshots you could select items in a Bundle with the number keys. We removed this because it was conflicting with hotkeys used by expert players, and it was not as useful now that the Bundle can have more than 10 items visible._

## Changes

-   Raiders must find a place to spawn no more than 96 blocks vertically above or below the village center, or a raid will not start
-   It is now much less likely for raiders to not find a valid place to spawn when raiding

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 51

## Data Pack Version 51

-   Trial Spawner configurations in fields `normal_config` and `ominous_config` are now defined in registry `trial_spawner`
    -   This allows for easier customization of Trial Spawner configurations in data packs
    -   Inlined configuration data is still supported
-   Entities' rotation on the x axis is now clamped between -90 and 90
-   `loot` command now returns an error when trying to drop from block without loot table (like air)

### Loot tables

-   Special loot table `empty` has been removed and is no longer defined in vanilla data pack

#### Sheep loot tables

-   Sheep now always uses a single loot table `entities/sheep`
-   Wool drops are still defined in sub-tables in `entities/sheep/<color>`, but they are now just dispatched from the main table
    -   Note: mutton drop is now controlled by the main table, while sub-tables are responsible only for wool drop
-   Sheep shearing is now controlled by loot table found as `shearing/sheep`

#### Mooshroom shearing loot table

-   Mooshroom shearing is now controlled by loot table found as `shearing/mooshroom`

### New conditions

#### `sheep` entity sub-predicate

New entity sub-predicate for testing sheep wool Fields:

-   `sheared` - optional boolean
-   `color` - optional wool dye color

# Minecraft Snapshot 24w34a

Hello! Here is the next snapshot for 1.21.2! It contains some much-requested tweaks to experimental features, as well as some technical changes and optimizations.

Happy mining!

## Experimental Features

The following changes only apply when their respective Experiment is turned on, either by activating the corresponding experimental data pack or by turning it on in the Experiments screen while creating the world.

These experiments have no effect unless enabled. You can find more information about Feature Toggles [here](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/testing-new-minecraft-features/feature-toggles-java-edition).

### Bundles

-   The Bundle tooltip now fits 3 rows and can always show at least 8 item types

> **Developer's Note**: _Items fill up a Bundle in rows of four, and when a row is full it is pushed down by the row above. This means there can be empty spaces in the top row._
> 
> _In the previous 2020 Bundle experiment, items filled in from the top without leaving any gaps. We changed this behavior because it meant that items moved left and right in the Bundle as new items were added. This made it more difficult for some players to keep track of the order of items and some even reported that the items were moving randomly!_
> 
> _With only two rows in the tooltip, the behavior of pushing a full row of items further down the Bundle removed half of the visible items, which was too much. We're adding a third row to make the design work better and allow players to see more of the items in their Bundles as they fill up._

### Minecart Improvements

Please note that the experimental features behind this toggle are not aimed at any future release at this time. Instead, this is a place for us to try out changes and gather feedback.

We are excited to hear what you think about these changes: please share your feedback on this [feedback page](https://aka.ms/fbcarts).

-   Minecarts no longer forcefully snap to the center of a block when landing on a rail
    -   Minecarts snap to corners along the diagonal, and snaps after being pushed by a Piston
    -   This allows for Piston bolts and similar contraptions
-   Dispensers are allowed to stack Minecarts again
-   Minecarts now more easily come to rest at opposing slopes
-   Minecarts no longer tilt during a short fall, or when they are falling straight down
-   Minecarts are now placed (or dispensed) with the correct rotation straight away when put on rails
    -   They are also placed with the correct rotation onto slopes
-   Minecarts no longer phase through blocks on slopes when going up or down, they collide instead

### Redstone Experiments

Please note that the experimental features behind this toggle are not aimed at any future release at this time.  
Instead, this is a place for us to try out changes and gather feedback.

We are excited to hear what you think about these changes: please share your feedback on the [feedpack page](https://aka.ms/fbredstone).

> **Developer's Note**: _The removal of excessive neighbor updates around wire affects the behavior of Quasi-Connectivity based contraptions. We plan to address these issues at a later point._

-   Redstone wire updates now have a left-first preference
    -   That means if there is a fork in a wire and the distance on both sides is the same, the left side will be updated first
    -   This removes most of the random behavior
    -   The remaining edge cases which are still random are situations where wire gets powered from above or below without enough context

## Changes

The following changes apply to the game regardless of which experiments are turned on.

-   Projectiles such as Arrows, Tridents and Fishing Bobbers now bounce on the world border if hit
-   Framerate has been improved when using higher render distances
    -   Significantly reduced the performance impact when turning the camera
-   The recipe book now repeats the last selected recipe when a "selected" key is pressed (space or either enter key)
-   Items which convert to another item after consumption will no longer do so in Creative
    -   For example, a Honey Bottle will no longer add a Glass Bottle to your inventory when consumed in Creative

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 50
-   Resource Pack version is now 36

## Data Pack Version 50

### Changed Item Components

#### `minecraft:food`

-   The food component has been changed to become a data container which only holds the food stats applied when the item is consumed
    -   This component no longer gives it the ability to be consumed, and can be done instead with the new `consumable` component
-   Format: object with fields
    -   `nutrition` The amount of nutrition applied when consumed
    -   `saturation` The amount of saturation applied when consumed
    -   `can_always_eat` Whether it can be consumed even when the user is not hungry

### New Item Components

#### `minecraft:use_remainder`

-   If present, will replace the item with a remainder item if its stack count has decreased after use
    -   If the item has a stack count higher than 0 after use, the remainder item will be added to the inventory instead
    -   If the inventory is full when trying to add a remainder item to it, it will be dropped on the ground instead
-   Format: single value as an item stack
    -   e.g. `use_remainder={id:'minecraft:stick', count:1}`

#### `minecraft:use_cooldown`

-   If present, this item will apply a cooldown to all items of the same type when it has been used

    -   `seconds`: Positive float representing the amount of seconds the cooldown will take place for
    -   `cooldown_group`: Optional namespaced id representing the cooldown group
        -   If present, this item will be part of a cooldown group and no longer share cooldowns with its base item type
        -   Instead, cooldowns applied to this item will only be shared with any other items that are part of the same cooldown group
    -   e.g. `use_cooldown={seconds:1.5, cooldown_group:"minecraft:custom_weapon"}`

#### `minecraft:consumable`

-   If present, this item can be consumed on use
    -   If `food`, `potion_contents`, `ominous_bottle_amplifier` or `suspicious_stew_contents` are also present on this item, consuming this will apply the stats and effects of those components
-   Format: object with fields
    -   `consume_seconds`: Non-negative float, the amount of seconds it takes for a player to consume the item
        -   Default value: 1.6
    -   `animation`: The animation used during consumption of the item
        -   Default value: `eat`
        -   Accepted values:
            -   `none`
            -   `eat`
            -   `drink`
            -   `block`
            -   `bow`
            -   `spear`
            -   `crossbow`
            -   `spyglass`
            -   `toot_horn`
            -   `brush`
    -   `sound`: Sound event, the sound used during and on completion of the item's consumption
        -   Default value: `entity.generic.eat`
    -   `has_consume_particles`: Boolean, whether consumption particles are emitted while consuming this item
        -   Default value: `true`
    -   `on_consume_effects`: An optional list of side effects which take place as a result of consuming this item
        -   There are currently 5 valid consume effects
        -   `minecraft:apply_effects`
            -   `effects`: A list of status effect instances applied once consumed
            -   `probability`: Float, the probability the above effects will be applied once consumed
                -   Default value: 1.0
        -   `minecraft:remove_effects`
            -   `effects`: A set of status effects removed once consumed, as either a tag or list of ids
        -   `minecraft:clear_all_effects`
            -   Clears all status effects of the consumer

                -   Default value: 16.0
        -   `minecraft:play_sound`
            -   `sound`: Sound event, played once consumed
    -   e.g. `consumable={consume_seconds:3.0, animation:'eat', sound:'entity.generic.eat', has_consume_particles:true, on_consume_effects:[{type:'minecraft:clear_all_effects'}]}`

## Resource Pack Versions 36

### Shaders & Post-process Effects

> **Developer's Note**: _Although it is possible in Resource Packs, overriding Core Shaders is considered as unsupported and not an intended Resource Pack feature. These shaders exist as part of the internal implementation of the game, and as such, may change at any time as the game's internals evolve. We understand that overriding Core Shaders is used for very cool Resource Pack features, many of which lack supported alternatives. We would like to provide better, supported alternatives in the future._

-   Shader program configurations can now specify preprocessor define directives to apply to their linked shaders
    -   Many shader implementations have been merged by making use of this
-   The format of core shader and post-processing shader configurations have been consolidated
-   The `rendertype_entity_glint_direct` shader has been removed (replaced by `rendertype_entity_glint`)
-   The `rendertype_entity_translucent_cull` shader has been removed (replaced by `rendertype_item_entity_translucent_cull`)

#### Shader Program Definitions

-   Program definitions for post-processing effects (`assets/<namespace>/shaders/program/<name>.json`) have been made consistent with core shader definitions (`assets/<namespace>/shaders/core/<name>.json`)
    -   The `blend` field has been removed, as it had no use
    -   The `attributes` field has been removed, instead the `Position` attribute will always be bound
    -   The provided uniforms have been consolidated with those provided to core shaders
        -   `Time` has been renamed to `GameTime`
-   The `vertex` and `fragment` shader references in program definitions (including post-processing effects) are now namespaced shader ids
    -   A vertex shader `<namespace>:<path>` will resolve to `assets/<namespace>/shaders/<path>.vsh`
    -   A fragment shader `<namespace>:<path>` will resolve to `assets/<namespace>/shaders/<path>.fsh`
-   Shader source files are no longer required to be in the `shaders/core` subdirectory, this only exists for organization
-   Added `defines` field to program definitions (object with fields)
    -   Allows GLSL define directives to be injected into the shader source, which can be referenced in the shader
    -   `values` (map of string to string)
        -   Will be injected as `#define <key> <value>` at the top of the file
    -   `flags` (list of strings)
        -   Will be injected as `#define <key>` at the top of the file

#### Shader Imports

-   The `#moj_import` directive now supports namespaced includes with absolute paths
    -   For example, `#moj_import <minecraft:fog.glsl>` will import `assets/minecraft/shaders/include/fog.glsl`
-   Relative imports are not namespaced and behave as before

#### Post-process Effect Definitions

-   Post-processing effect configuration has been moved out of the `assets/<namespace>/shaders/post` directory to just `assets/<namespace>/post_effect`
-   Vertex and fragment shaders used by these effects have been moved from `assets/<namespace>/shaders/program` to `assets/<namespace>/shaders/post`
-   `name` has been renamed to `program`, and is now a namespaced id of a shader program configuration
    -   `<namespace>:<path>` will resolve to `assets/<namespace>/shaders/<path>.json`

# Minecraft 24w33a

We know you have been waiting long for the next update, and we are finally kicking off the new snapshot cycle with Snapshot 24w33a!

Over the summer someone changed our password and wouldn't let us know what it was until we finished 200 bug fixes (the password was cubepork14 by the way). This update also features a Bundle of new Experiments that we are eager for you to try out!

Enable the new experimental features in the Experiments menu when creating a new world and let us know what you think!

Read below for a full list of the changes included.

Your thoughts on the game continue to shape new updates so please upvote and report any new bugs at [bugs.mojang.com](https://bugs.mojang.com/) and leave us your feedback at [feedback.minecraft.net](https://feedback.minecraft.net).

## Experimental Features

The following changes only apply when their respective Experiment is turned on, either by activating the corresponding experimental data pack or by turning it on in the Experiments screen while creating the world.

These experiments have no effect unless enabled. You can find more information about Feature Toggles [here](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/testing-new-minecraft-features/feature-toggles-java-edition).

### Bundles

Bundles are back The Bundle was added to Java Edition as an experiment in 2020. We are now working on Bundles again! To test Bundles you must create a new world with the Bundles experiment turned on. (When creating a new world click ‘More’, then ‘Experiments’, then click the button next to the word ‘Bundles’.) A Bundle is an item that lets you stack different blocks or items together in the same inventory slot. Different items normally don’t stack together, so you can end up wasting space by only having a few items in each slot. A Bundle lets you pack those items together so there is no wasted space.

![Screenshots of an inventory with no empty slots and then the same inventory with 8 empty slots because some incomplete stacks have moved inside a Bundle.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/bundlebeforeafterimage.jpg)

The Bundle has a tooltip that shows some of the items inside. If the Bundle has up to 8 item types, you will see all of them and can pull any item out immediately. If there are more than 8 item types then some rows of items will be hidden. You may want to craft a new Bundle to keep everything easy to reach. A Bundle can be crafted with 1 String and 1 Leather. Please try out this all-new version of the Bundle and let us know what you think!

-   A Bundle only fits one stack (usually 64 items) but it can be a mixture of many different item types
-   You can insert items into a Bundle directly in the inventory
-   Bundles have a tooltip that shows the items inside
    -   If a Bundle has less than 8 item types inside, the tooltip will show all of them
    -   Otherwise the tooltip will show the top two rows of items and the others will be hidden below
-   You can select any of the visible items to pull out of the Bundle
    -   Right-click to take the first item
    -   Use the number keys or scroll wheel to select a different item, then right-click to take it

> **Developer's Note:** In the original Bundle experiment you could only pick the top item. We got a lot of feedback that players wanted more flexibility when taking items out. To address this we put a submenu inside the Bundle, which has never been done before in Minecraft!

-   When selecting an item to remove, the Bundle icon shows that item poking out of the Bundle
-   When holding a Bundle in hand, you can empty it onto the ground by right-clicking
-   The Bundle is crafted with one String above one Leather

> **Developer's Note:** The original prototype for Bundles was much more expensive to craft and used Rabbit Hide which is only available in certain biomes, so the player had to explore to get their first Bundle. In this version we’ve made it cheaper and something that you can craft at home in almost any biome. We want it to be easy to get Bundles in a new world so you can use it in your early adventures.

-   The controls have changed from the original prototype:
    -   Use left-click to put an item into a Bundle
    -   Use right-click to remove the top item type from a Bundle
    -   When the Bundle tooltip is visible, use number keys or the mouse wheel to select a different item type then use right-click to remove it

### Redstone Experiments

Added a new Experiment containing various Redstone-related changes. This can be enabled by selecting "Redstone Experiments" in the Experiments menu when creating a world.

Please note that the experimental features behind this toggle are not aimed at any future release at this time. Instead, this is a place for us to try out changes and gather feedback.  
We are excited to hear what you think about these changes: please share your feedback on the [feedpack page](https://aka.ms/fbredstone).

#### Redstone Wire

-   The performance impact of Redstone wire (connected blocks of Redstone Dust) has been improved
-   Redstone wire now only triggers block updates on blocks that may receive power from the wire
-   Before a line of wire causes block updates, the new signal strength of all connected wires is set
-   The update order around Redstone wire has been changed
    -   The aim is to make wire work the same, independent of position and orientation
    -   When possible the order is deterministic based on the context the updates are caused in
    -   When there is not enough context to fully determine the order, the rest is picked at random

> **Developer's note:** We know that randomness in Redstone is usually unwanted.  
> We've used it here because we've made things deterministic whenever it makes sense, and sometimes it just doesn't make sense - and we don't want some hidden state (like location-based hashes!) determining the order and making machines work differently at different coordinates or in different orientations.  
> The screenshot below shows an example of a 'random' vs 'non-random' wire - we think it's actually pretty logical, and is within the players control to build machines that behave deterministically.  
> But we are looking forward to hearing what you think after trying it out!

![The image shows three Redstone machines. In each of them a lever is powering a Redstone wire leading to two pistons that are trying to push into the same block. In the machine on the left, the wire to the left piston is shorter and the left piston is the one that got to extend. In the machine on the right, the wire to the right piston is shorter and the right piston is the one that got to extend. In the machine in the center, the wire is the same length to both pistons and which piston extended was picked by random choice.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/redstone.jpg)

##### Order in Which a Line of Wire Changes

-   When a line of wire turns on, the wires closer to the power source will cause block updates first
-   When a line of wire turns off, the wires closer to where the power source was, will cause block updates first
-   When two wires have the same distance to the power source, which of them causes updates first is picked at random
    -   The random choice is made once for the entire line of wire, to limit the amount of possible outcomes
    -   This means, when powering a line of wire from the side, it randomly chooses one of two possible update orders
    -   The advantage of having few possible update orders is that the results are more predictable

##### Block Updates Around a Wire

-   The order in which blocks around the wire update is based on the direction the wire received an update from
-   Currently, the order is: back, front, left, right, down, up
    -   left and right may be swapped, depending on the random choice made by the line of wire
-   When the updates are further distributed through solid blocks, the same order is applied there

#### Known Issues

As this experiment only changes Redstone wire, interactions with other components may not always act as expected, especially when it comes to update orders.

### Minecart Improvements

Added a new Experiment containing various movement changes to Minecarts. This can be enabled by selecting "Minecart Improvements" in the Experiments menu when creating a world.

Our long term goal is to make vehicle travel, like minecarts, a viable option for players compared to other late-game options which currently dominate most playstyles. To achieve this, we aim to make riding minecarts a smooth experience, with consistent and predictable motion and rotation. With this feature toggle we are laying a foundation to build upon in the future. We are aware of that these changes will break some existing contraptions, which is why we want to collaborate with the community to shape the upgrade and future experience of riding minecarts.

Please note that the experimental features behind this toggle are not aimed at any future release at this time. Instead, this is a place for us to try out changes and gather feedback.

We are excited to hear what you think about these changes: please share your feedback on this [feedback page](https://aka.ms/fbcarts).

#### Movement Changes

-   Minecarts will articulate their movement better when going fast, riding on the rail all the time
    -   Minecarts will now smoothly turn along with the track and are less likely to halt or derail
-   Minecarts can now jump better
    -   They keep their vertical momentum when the track ends with a slope
    -   Minecarts will tilt to visually articulate while in the air
    -   No rail grinding sound is played when Minecarts are flying through the air
-   Added a new accessibility setting that makes players follow the rotation of Minecarts they ride
    -   Defaults to off
    -   Only has effect when within a world with the experiment enabled
-   Added new gamerule `minecartMaxSpeed` that changes the maximum speed of Minecarts
    -   Defaults to 8 and goes up to 1000 blocks per second.
    -   Setting it to a specific value does not guarantee that a minecart will reach that particular max speed - there are built in air resistances and similar effects that the speed added through slopes or powered rails need to overcome
    -   This gamerule only exists in worlds with the experiment enabled

#### Minecart Changes

-   Minecarts can no longer be placed within another Minecart by the player or a dispenser
-   Minecarts can now consistently be placed next to each other along a track
-   Minecarts now pick up mobs more consistently when moving along a track

#### Known Impact

-   We are aware that these changes will make certain contraptions such as 'piston bolts' not work at all, or have their behavior changed
-   Very delicate rail networks will have their timings changed due to slight changes in speeds, movement distance, friction etc.
-   Contraptions that rely on Minecarts snapping to rails will no longer work, or have their behavior changed

## Changes

-   Various items and blocks have had their assigned rarities changed
-   Tweaked portal cooldowns of vehicles and projectiles
    -   After using a Nether Portal, Minecarts and Boats now only need to leave the portal for 0.5 seconds to use a portal again (down from previous 15 seconds)
    -   After using a Nether Portal, projectiles such as Enderpearls and Arrows now only need to leave the portal for 2 ticks to use a portal again (down from previous 15 seconds)
-   Suspicious Stew recipes are now shown in the recipe book
-   Breeze no longer have a minimum distance required to attack a target
-   Added a new death message for when killed by a Mace smash attack
-   Wolves can now also be fed cod, cooked cod, salmon, cooked salmon, tropical fish, pufferfish and rabbit stew to achieve parity with Bedrock
-   Enchanted shields now have the same reduced glint as enchanted armor
-   Banner Pattern items have new names and icons
-   Smithing Template items are now named after their template type instead of the generic "Smithing Template" name
    -   They instead specify that they are a Smithing Template through a subtitle in the hover text
-   The game will now limit the maximum framerate when it is minimized or when the player is AFK
    -   A new Video Setting is introduced to configure this behavior
-   Added language support for Tzotzil and Belarusian (Latin)
-   Tweaked Bee flight distances and cooldowns
    -   Bees now wander around randomly for less time after exiting a nest/hive
    -   If a bee has a known nest/hive, it will travel less far from it, thus being less likely to get lost
    -   Significantly increased the amount of time a Bee can take to return to a known nest/hive before it gives up trying to return home
    -   Bees are now a lot less likely to get stuck on corners or when they are close to a nest/hive they are trying to return to
    -   Bees are also now a lot less likely to try and pathfind to a flower it cannot reach
-   Updated the Bundle
-   Bats can now spawn at any height, not just below sea level, as long as it is dark enough and there is a solid block to spawn on
-   A triggered raid will no longer start if the raiders cannot find a place to spawn within a reasonable distance of the village they are trying to raid
-   Added baby versions of Dolphins, Squids, and Glow Squids
-   Added small and large Salmon variants
-   The title specified in the `written_book_content` component will now be prioritized over `custom_name` and `item_name` for any item with a non-empty title in this component
-   The performance of the server (tick rate) has been improved when using higher render distances
    -   Furthermore, the impact of loading and generating chunks on tick rate has been reduced
-   Redstone Torches have been given a new look with updated textures and models, to give it a unique and distinctive identity

### Banner Patterns

-   Each Banner Pattern item now includes their pattern type in their name instead of as a subtitle
    -   Unique item textures have been added to better distinguish each pattern type
-   The following Banner Patterns have been added to achieve parity with Bedrock:
    -   Field Masoned
        -   Crafted with Paper and Bricks
    -   Bordure Indented
        -   Crafted with Paper and Vines
-   The Bricks and Curved Border patterns in the Loom can no longer be accessed without the above Banner Patterns

### Rarity

-   Rarity is a set of categories which determine the color used to display the name of an item or block
    -   It has no gameplay impact, but is used to signal how difficult something is to obtain
    -   By default, unless specified otherwise, all items and blocks have a rarity of Common which displays their name in the color white
-   We have re-evaluated the rarity of all items and blocks in the game to more accurately reflect the current challenge of obtaining them, given the following guidelines:
    -   Items and blocks become more rare depending on the following factors:
        -   The chance of finding it in a loot table, including mob drops
        -   The amount of travelling required to obtain it
        -   The difficulty of any obstacle which must be overcome to obtain it
        -   The possible amount of that item or block which exists in the world
    -   Any item or block which can be crafted must inherit the highest rarity of its crafting ingredients
        -   For example, a Mace has an Epic rarity because one of its ingredients (the Heavy Core) has an Epic rarity
        -   Likewise, any crafted item which has only Common crafting ingredients must also be Common
-   The lists below detail the items and blocks which have changed to that rarity category

#### Common

-   End Crystal
-   Golden Apple

#### Uncommon

-   Sniffer Egg
-   Chainmail Helmet
-   Chainmail Chestplate

    -   Ward
    -   11
    -   Wait
    -   Relic
    -   5
    -   Precipice

#### Rare

-   Enchanted Golden Apple
    -   Enchanted Golden Apples have become more common in recent years due to being accessible in both Ancient Cities and Trial Chambers, warranting a demotion to Rare instead of Epic
-   Trident
    -   We recently increased Trident's rarity up to Epic from Common, but after re-evaluating we felt that it was easier to obtain than other items in the Epic category such as Heavy Cores or Elytras
-   Nether Star
-   Ward Armor Trim
-   Eye Armor Trim
-   Vex Armor Trim
-   Spire Armor Trim
-   Wither Skeleton Skull
-   Skull Charge Banner Pattern
    -   Now that Wither Skeleton Skulls are Rare, these banner patterns should be Rare as well
-   Thing Banner Pattern
    -   Now that Enchanted Golden Apples are Rare, these banner patterns should be Rare as well
-   The following Music Discs:
    -   Pigstep
    -   otherside
    -   Creator

#### Epic

-   Elytra
-   Dragon Head
-   Silence Armor Trim

### Inactivity FPS limit

-   The game will now limit the maximum framerate in certain situations
-   These situations are controlled by a new Video Setting: `Reduce FPS when`
-   Possible options are:
    -   `Mimimized`
        -   Limits framerate to 10 FPS only when the game window is minimized
    -   `AFK`
        -   Limits framerate to 30 FPS when the game is not getting any player input for more than a minute
        -   Further limits to 10 FPS after 9 more minutes of no input
        -   Also limits to 10 FPS when the game window is minimized
-   The default is `AFK`

### Player Safety

#### Skin Reporting

-   Added reporting reason "Sexually inappropriate"
    -   This is intended for skins that are graphic in nature relating to sexual acts, sexual organs, and sexual violence
-   Removed reason "Defamation" due to lack of relevance for skins
-   Removed reason "Threat of harm to others" due to already being covered by "Harassment or bullying" reporting reason

#### Name Reporting

-   Added a text label above the description box to clarify that only the name of the player is subject to the report

#### Realms

-   Extended the `text-filtering-config` in order to support an internal migration for Realms Profanity Filtering
    -   Servers currently utilizing the `text-filtering-config` will be able to continue to do so without any changes

### Trial Chambers

-   Added new variations to the hallways, including "Encounters": Short challenges leading to a larger chamber.
-   Beds in intersections now have their colors randomized.
-   Replaced the empty chests at the entrance of chamber with a Hopper and Barrel to better show the players that these are meant for disposal and inventory managment!

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 49
-   Resource Pack version is now 35
-   Added some information about data pack structure (for example, data-driven registries) to generated reports
-   Added unique block sounds to the Monster Spawner block
-   New `server.properties` option: `pause-when-empty-seconds` (default `60`)
    -   When set to a positive value, causes the server to pause when no player has been online for that many seconds
-   Removed `server.properties` options: `spawn-animals` and `spawn-npcs`

### Network Protocol

-   Added `minecraft:client_tick_end` serverbound packet during play phase, sent when the client finishes processing its current tick
    -   This is unused by the Vanilla server, but left for use by custom server implementations
-   Added ability for custom servers to override the order that players appear in the 'tab list'
    -   This is controlled by a non-negative ordering index that is sorted highest to lowest
-   The client now shares the state of the 'Particles' limiter option to be used by custom servers

## Data Pack Version 49

-   Goat Horn instruments are now data-driven
-   Sheep shearing is now controlled by loot tables found as `shearing/sheep/<color>`
-   Mooshroom shearing is now controlled by loot tables found as `shearing/mooshroom/<variant>`
-   Snow golem shearing is now controlled by a loot table found as `shearing/snow_golem`
-   The `crafting_special_suspiciousstew` recipe type has been removed
-   Added new fields to painting variant definitions
-   Added optional field `explosion_power` to `tnt` and `tnt_minecart` types
    -   Defaults to 4
    -   For TNT minecarts, field value is added to speed-based explosion power
-   Added support for Enchantment trigger `projectile_spawned` in the following items:
    -   Snowballs
    -   Tridents
    -   Small Fireballs
    -   Thrown Potions
    -   Ender Pearls
    -   Fishing Rod
    -   Firework Rocket

    -   Eggs
-   Added new item components
-   Attribute IDs no longer have `generic.`, `player.` and `zombie.` prefixes
-   Recipe ingredient format has been simplified
-   Invalid `selector` patterns in Chat Components will now cause commands to fail to parse, instead of resolving to an empty string
-   Added `tempt_range` attribute - can be used to change the range, in blocks, at which temptable mobs can be tempted

### Instruments

Goat Horn instruments are now defined in a data pack registry folder called `instruments`. Like other registries, changing this content in data packs is considered experimental and requires a full world re-load to take effect.

Fields:

-   `sound_event`: The sound event the instrument plays
-   `range`: The maximum range (in blocks) at which the sound can be heard
-   `use_duration`: The amount of time (in seconds) the instrument is considered in use after triggering, which also serves as its cooldown
-   `description`: A Text Component used as the descrpition of the instrument in item tooltips

### Painting variant

-   Added new optional fields `author` and `title`, holding text components to be displayed in the creative menu tooltip
-   This replaces previous mechanism where those values were derived from variant name
-   Author tooltip has been removed for `earth`, `wind`, `fire`, `water` and `wither` variants

### Tags

#### Item Tags

-   `furnace_minecart_fuel`: Items that can be used to refuel furnace minecart
-   `villager_picks_up`: Items that a Villager will try to pick up from the ground
-   Added new tags to control which items can be used to craft and repair various tool sets:
    -   `wooden_tool_materials`
    -   `iron_tool_materials`
    -   `gold_tool_materials`
    -   `diamond_tool_materials`
    -   `netherite_tool_materials`

### New Item Components

#### `minecraft:repairable`

-   If present, and this item is damageable, this item can be repaired in an Anvil using the specified ingredient
-   Format: object with fields
    -   `items`: Item, list of Items, or hash-prefixed Item Tag matching what can be used to repair this item
    -   e.g. `repairable={items:'stick'}`

#### `minecraft:enchantable`

-   If present (and any enchantments are applicable), this item can be enchanted in an Enchanting Table
-   Format: object with fields
    -   `value`: Positive integer, a higher value allows enchantments with a higher cost to be picked
    -   e.g. `enchantable={value:15}`

### Recipes

The format used for recipe ingredients has been simplified and aligned with other fields that accept item lists (like item predicates):

-   For items: `{ "item": "<item id>" }` now becomes `"<item id>"`
-   For tags: `{ "tag": "<tag id>" }` now becomes `"#<tag id>"`
-   Lists of items are still allowed, but tags can no longer appear in such list
-   Remaining restrictions:
    -   `minecraft:air` can't appear anywhere in ingredient
    -   ingredient must have at least one tag or item
-   Fields `template`, `base` and `addition` in `smithing_transform` and `smithing_trim` recipes are now optional instead of accepting empty list

## Resource Pack Version 35

-   Added break, fall, hit, place, and step sounds for the Spawner block
-   Removals and renames of some translations is now automatically applied at startup
-   Updated the format of post-processing effect definitions
-   Added support for emissive layers for block models
-   The texture map for the Arrow and Bee Stinger models have been updated
-   The model and UV mapping of the Dragon Egg have been updated
-   Updated textures, models and sounds for the Bundle item
    -   Bundle icon has new models and textures
    -   The Bundle UI has new textures and scaling
    -   Added a new sound for when failing to add an item to a Bundle
-   The models and UV mapping related to the Torch and blocks containing Redstone Torch have been updated
-   Added new models for the Redstone Torch and updated its texture

### Shaders & Post-process Effects

-   The format of post-processing effect configurations have been updated
-   The `ChunkOffset` uniform in terrain shaders has been renamed to `ModelOffset`

#### Post-process Effect Definitions

-   `intarget` and `auxtargets` have been merged into a single `inputs` list, as specified by the input format below
-   `outtarget` has been renamed to `output` with the same format
-   `targets` is now a map between target name and target definition, as opposed to a list
    -   Inline target names are replaced with an empty object
        -   For example, `["swap"]` becomes `{"swap": {}}`
    -   Target definitions with a specific size remain the same, with the `name` field moved into the map key
        -   For example, `[{"name": "potato", "width": 16, "height": 16}]` becomes `{"potato": {"width": 16, "height": 16}}`

##### Input Format

For both render target and texture inputs, the following fields may be specified:

-   `sampler_name`: string - prefix to set up both `_Sampler` and `_Size` uniforms
    -   For example, `"sampler_name": "Diffuse"` will link to the `DiffuseSampler` and `DiffuseSize` uniforms
    -   This was previously always `DiffuseSampler` and `InSize` for `intarget`
    -   For `auxtargets`, the `name` defined the sampler uniform, and the size was given as `AuxSize<index>`
-   `bilinear`: boolean (default: `false`) - if true, the input will be sampled with a bilinear filter
    -   This formerly only existed on texture inputs, however now functions for render targets
    -   For render targets, replaces the now removed `use_linear_filter` field on the pass definition

For inputs from a render target, the following fields may be specified:

-   `target`: namespaced id - the render target id
    -   Either a custom target id defined in the same file, or `minecraft:main` to reference the main screen target
    -   This replaces the former `id` field, which was a free-form string
-   `use_depth_buffer`: boolean (default: `false`) - true to sample from the depth texture, false to sample from the color texture
    -   This replaces the former `:depth` suffix applied to the target id

For inputs from a static texture, the following fields may be specified:

-   `location`: namespaced string - the location to a static texture file that can be sampled by the effect
    -   As the `id` field did before, this resolves to a texture at `assets/<namespace>/textures/effect/<path>.png`
-   `width`: positive integer - width in pixels of the texture
-   `height`: positive integer - height in pixels of the texture

##### External Targets

-   The 'Fabulous' graphics transparency post-processing config no longer specifies the sorted framebuffers as custom targets
    -   These are instead imported in the same way as the `minecraft:main` target
    -   `translucent`, `itemEntity`, `particles`, `weather`, `clouds` are now `minecraft:translucent`, `minecraft:item_entity`, `minecraft:particles`, `minecraft:weather`, and `minecraft:clouds` respectively
-   The entity outline processing shader similarly imports the `minecraft:entity_outline` target

## Translation removals and renames

-   During load some deprecated translation strings will now be removed and/or renamed
-   Packs that used those translations will need to re-add them manually
-   The full list is available in `/assets/minecraft/lang/deprecated.json` file inside the game's JAR file

## Emissive layers for block models

-   Added an optional `light_emission` field to block model elements
-   Integer value between 0 and 15, with 0 being the default value (no light emission)
-   If specified and non-zero, this will behave as the minimum light level that the element can receive

# Minecraft 1.21 Release Candidate 1

Here is the first Release Candidate for 1.21, addressing some critical issues. Apart from that we decided to revert the changes made in Pre-Release 4 to armor enchantments based on your feedback.

Happy mining!

## Changes

-   The changes to Burn Time reduction from Fire Protection and Knockback reduction from Blast Protection from pre-release 4 have been reverted
    -   We have heard your feedback, and we expect to rebalance these two enchantments in the future to find a better place for them
    -   Values are now the same as in 1.20.6
    -   These effects still stack from wearing multiple pieces (changed from 1.20.6)

# Minecraft 1.21 Pre-Release 4

Frog day on a Friday? What could go wrong? We're back with 1.21 Pre-Release 4 today, with a couple more bug fixes, and some tweaks to the Blast Resistance and Fire Protection enchantments.

## Changes

-   The "Burning Time" reduction effect of Fire Protection and "Knockback Resistance" effect of Blast Protection now stack from wearing several pieces
    -   To get the maximum benefit of these effects, you now need to wear a full set of enchanted armor
    -   Wearing a fully enchanted armor set still grants the same effect as in 1.20.6
    -   Wearing only a single piece of enchanted armor now has reduced effect compared to before
-   After a Primed TNT has gone through a Nether Portal, it will no longer be able to destroy Nether Portal blocks

# Minecraft 1.21 Pre-Release 3

The third pre-release for 1.21 is now available and it comes with even more bugfixes!

Additionally, we introduced some intentional but undocumented changes to the Wind Burst Enchantment in Pre-Release 1 last week. To remedy this, we're including those changes in this changelog instead.

Happy mining!

## Changes

### Wind Burst

-   Following changes were introduced in Pre-Release 1; The Wind Burst enchantment now bounces the player 7 blocks up per enchantment level
    -   With great power comes great responsibility - and risk! At level 3, the enchantment will bounce the player 21 blocks up which _doing some quick maths_ will hurt quite a bit when hitting the ground again
    -   In other words, make sure you have a target locked in (or other means of mitigating the fall damage) before making contact with the ground again

## Technical Changes

-   Data Pack version is now 48

# Minecraft 1.21 Pre-Release 1

We're bringing you the first Pre-Release of 1.21 with leashable boats, portal-able Ender Pearls and bug fixes!

With this snapshot, we are temporarily removing the functionality of lighting blocks on fire using the Fire Aspect enchantment, as we want to refine it further. This functionality will be reintroduced in a later release.

Happy portaling! ;)

## New Features

### Ominous Trial Spawner

-   Mobs removed by a Trial Spawner converting to Ominous state now drop any items they previously picked up from the ground

## Changes

-   Mace attack speed has been changed to 0.6
-   Doors of different materials can now form a double door
-   Ender Pearls that are thrown through portals can now teleport players to a different dimension than the one they are currently in
-   It is now possible to ride entities such as Horses or Minecarts through portals
    -   When riding entities through portals, the delay before teleporting is not applied

## Technical Changes

-   Data Pack version is now 46
-   Removed the `entitiesWithPassengersCanUsePortals` gamerule that was introduced last snapshot. Entity with passengers being able to use portals is now the default behavior.
-   Report data generator now includes information about network packets
-   The game will now store reports from failed chunks' loads and saves in the `debug` directory

### Server links

-   There are some generic-use link names, like "Support" or "Website", without any special functionality

## Data Pack Versions 42 through 46

-   Added new configurable fields to jigsaw structures and `single_pool_element` types

### Enchantments

#### Level-Based Values

##### `lookup`

A Level-Based Value type that maps a list of values to specific levels, and applies a fallback if the level is greater than the number of values supplied. Fields:

-   `values` - A list of values indexed by `level - 1` to apply, if present
-   `fallback` - A fallback Level-Based Value to apply if the level is greater than the size of `values`

#### Effect Conditions

Unlike with loot tables, all effect conditions need to be inline objects and cannot be references.

### Tags

#### Block Tags

-   `fire_aspect_lightable` has been removed
    -   With this snapshot, we are temporarily removing the functionality of lighting blocks on fire using the Fire Aspect enchantment, as we want to refine it further. This functionality will be reintroduced in a later release.

### Loot tables

#### Conditions

##### `random_chance_with_enchanted_bonus`

-   `chance`: field has been removed
-   `unenchanted_chance`: new field for the chance for an unenchanted item
-   `enchanted_chance`: new field for the chance for an enchanted item - a Level-Based Value

### Structures

-   Added `liquid_settings` field to structures of type `minecraft:jigsaw`. Possible values:
    -   `apply_waterlogging`: If any waterloggable block overlaps with existing water, it will become waterlogged
    -   `ignore_waterlogging`: Will not waterlog any waterloggable blocks that overlap existing water
    -   Default value is `apply_waterlogging`
-   Added optional field `override_liquid_settings` to `single_pool_element` element type
    -   Same possible values as the `liquid_settings` in jigsaw structures
    -   Overrides the inherited liquid settings from the parent jigsaw structure while generating this pool element

# Minecraft Snapshot 24w21a

This week we're bringing a Snapshot you can vibe out to! This time around we're bringing data-driven jukeboxes, a new gamerule, and a bunch of fixes.

Happy vibing!

## Changes

-   It seems we cooked a bit too hard with the new Piston sounds last week, which is why we're reverting back to the old sounds again
-   Lowered volume of original sounds to address initial feedback of Pistons being too loud
-   Pause menu now can include a list of links provided by server
-   Improvements to the disconnection screen
-   Any member of a Realm can now upgrade a world
-   In the Realms main screen, all online players of a Realm are displayed
    -   When hovered, a tooltip is shown with each player's head and name

### Vault

-   Added sound effect to help players understand they've already looted a vault

### Trial Chambers

-   Trial Chambers are less likely to generate in the Deep Dark

### Animal Panic

-   Animals now panic based on the damage caused by predefined Damage Source Types
-   The panic lasts for 2 seconds after the damage is dealt. The following damage type tags are used by vanilla animals:
    -   `panic_environmental_causes`: Used by Wolves, Polar Bears (adults) and Pandas
    -   `panic_causes`: Used by all other animals and baby Polar Bears

### Server links

-   Servers can now provide a list of links to clients
-   If client has received any links, a new button called "Server Links..." will show up in pause game screen
    -   To make space for that button, "Report Bugs" and "Give Feedback" buttons might be moved into a sub-screen if necessary

### Disconnection screen improvements

-   In some cases client will now store detailed information about disconnection (similar to crash reports)
-   When that happens, new "Open Disconnection Report Directory" button will be added to the disconnection screen
-   When server provides link for bug reporting, it will be also be added as a button to the disconnection screen

## Technical Changes

-   Resource Pack version is now 34
-   Data Pack version is now 45
-   Server can now provide list of links to client
-   Servers can add custom details to crash and disconnection reports

### Gamerules

-   Added new `entitiesWithPassengersCanUsePortals` gamerule
    -   When `true`, entities with passengers can use Nether Portals, End Portals and End Gateways
    -   Defaults to `false`

### Server links

-   New clientbound packet `server_links` is available in `configuration` and `game` protocols
-   On receival, client will make links available from pause menu
-   Link labels can be built-in or custom (i.e. any text)
-   Some built-ins also have special fuctionality:
    -   `report_bug`:
        -   link will be displayed on disconnection screen, if disconnection was caused by packet handling error
        -   link will be included as a comment in disconnection report
-   Added `bug-report-link` to `server.properties` to allow vanilla server to configure `report_bug` links
    -   If this field is non-empty, server will send that link to clients
    -   This field should contain well-formed URL

### Custom server crash report details

-   New clientbound packet `custom_report_details` is available in `configuration` and `game` protocols
-   This packet contains a list of key-value text entries
-   If received, contents of this packet will be added in a separate section to any crash or disconnection report generated during connection to this server

## Data Pack Version 45

-   Jukebox songs are now data-driven
-   Added new command syntax

### Jukebox Songs

-   Added a jukebox song registry which is loaded from data packs
-   Path to jukebox song definition is `data/<namespace>/jukebox_song/<id>.json`
-   Fields in definition:
    -   `sound_event` - sound event that is streamed when played by a Jukebox
    -   `description` - the name of the song that will be displayed in the hover tooltip represented as a Text Component
    -   `length_in_seconds` - length of the song in seconds as a positive float
    -   `comparator_output` - the redstone signal output by a comparator when played in a Jukebox, between 0 and 15
-   Added `minecraft:jukebox_playable` item stack component

#### `jukebox_playable` item component

-   If set, the item can be inserted into Jukeboxes to play a song
-   Format: object with fields
    -   `song`: jukebox song id
        -   The song that will be played by the Jukebox when this item stack is inserted
    -   `show_in_tooltip`: boolean (default: true)
        -   If false, the name of the song will not be shown in the tooltip
        -   This was formerly controlled by the `hide_additional_tooltip` component on Music Discs
    -   e.g. `jukebox_playable={song:'minecraft:precipice'}`, `jukebox_playable={song:'minecraft:precipice', show_in_tooltip:false}`

### Attributes

-   Attribute modifiers no longer have a UUID and name combination
-   Instead, attribute modifiers are now uniquely identified by a namespaced ID, similar to other resources
-   The ID of a modifier uniquely identifies it in the set of modifiers for a single attribute
    -   Using the same ID for different modifiers is allowed as long as the modifiers are for different attributes
-   Existing built-in modifiers will be upgraded to new IDs
-   Existing custom modifiers will be upgraded to the GUID as an ID in the `minecraft` namespace

#### `attribute` command

-   The `uuid` and `name` arguments have been replaced with a singular `id` argument

#### Item Stack Attribute Modifiers

-   The `uuid` and `name` fields have been removed.
-   Attribute Modifiers now have an `id` (namespaced ID) field
    -   This is a unique identifier per attribute for the modifier

#### Entity Attributes

-   Attributes are now stored as `attributes`
-   Attribute format:
    -   `id`, renamed from `Name`
    -   `base`, renamed from `Base`
    -   `modifiers`, renamed from `Modifiers`
        -   Now stores modifiers in the same format as modifiers in `attribute_modifiers` item stack components:
            -   `id`, replaces `UUID` and `Name`
            -   `amount`, renamed from `Amount`
            -   `operation`, renamed from `Operation`, now a named constant instead of an int:
                -   `add_value` - previously `0`
                -   `add_multiplied_base` - previously `1`
                -   `add_multiplied_total` - previously `2`

### Enchantments

#### Attribute Effects

Fields:

-   `name` & `uuid` have been removed, replaced by `id`
-   `id`: The namespaced ID of the Attribute Modifier to add
    -   This will be postfixed with the slot name when the enchanted item is equipped in a slot
    -   Must be unique to avoid different Enchantments (or other systems) interfering with each others

#### Entity Effect Types

##### `damage_item`

The damage is not applied to items held by players in creative mode.

##### Hit Block Parameters

-   Entities: `this`
-   Enchantment Level
-   Origin
-   Block State

#### Effect Components

-   `minecraft:hit_block`:
    -   Condition Context: changed to take a Hit Block Parameter - `this` is the entity hitting the Block

### Tags

#### Directory renames

-   Some registry types that used legacy datapack directory names (based on plural name of element) have been renamed to match registry name
-   Affected directories:
    -   `structures` -> `structure`
    -   `advancements` -> `advancement`
    -   `recipes` -> `recipe`
    -   `loot_tables` -> `loot_table`
    -   `predicates` -> `predicate`
    -   `item_modifiers` -> `item_modifier`
    -   `functions` -> `function`
    -   `tags/functions` -> `tags/function`

#### Item Tags

-   Removed `music_discs` item tag

#### Block Tags

-   `air`: All blocks that resemble air

#### Damage Type Tags

-   Removed `breeze_immune_to` damage type tag
-   Added `panic_environmental_causes`: Damage types that cause panic in aggressive animals that can panic, i.e. mobs that retaliate when attacked
-   Added `panic_causes`: Damage types that cause panic in passive animals, i.e. mobs that run away when attacked

### Predicates

#### Jukebox Playable Predicate

New item sub-predicate available as `jukebox_playable`.

-   Matcher for `jukebox_playable` component (like Music Discs)
-   Fields:
    -   `song` - optional id, list of ids or tag for jukebox song to be matched

#### Player Predicate

-   The `gamemode` field has been changed to accept a list of gamemodes

### Commands

-   Added `@n` entity selector, selecting the nearest entity
    -   This functions as `@e[sort=nearest,limit=1]`
    -   Additional requirements may still be provided; for example: `@n[type=pig]` will select the closest Pig

## Resource Pack Version 34

-   Added the `block.vault.reject_rewarded_player` sound event
-   Changes to Shaders

### Shaders

-   The `blend` block in core shader definitions has been removed, as it was not used
-   The `position_color_tex` shader has been removed, replaced with the pre-existing `position_tex_color`
-   The `glint_direct` shader has been removed, replaced with the pre-existing `glint` shader
-   The `armor_glint` shader has been removed, as it was unused

# Minecraft Snapshot 24w20a

After some recent irregularities in our Snapshot schedule (public holidays, we're looking at you!) we're back to shipping on a Wednesday! Among other things, 24w20a includes a buff to the amount of Redstone Dust dropped by Witches, as well as a long requested change to make Piston sounds a tad more pleasing to the ear. We're also throwing 41 new bug fixes into the mix, because we like squashing bugs.

Happy mining!

## Changes

-   Witches now always drop 4-8 redstone dust on death
    -   This is to improve the viability of farms that utilize Witch Huts to obtain Redstone Dust
-   Improved player attribute and effect handling
    -   Custom set base attributes are now kept when respawning
    -   Active effects and modifiers are kept when changing dimension or winning the game
-   Updated credits

### Sounds

-   Updated Piston sounds to lower volume and attenuation
    -   This was done to address the long-received feedback on the old sounds being too harsh and loud, creating very noisy redstone builds

## Technical Changes

-   Data Pack version is now 44

## Data Pack Version 44

-   `dimension_padding` jigsaw structure NBT tag was changed
    -   Now it is an object with fields:
        -   `bottom` the vertical padding at the bottom of the dimension, non-negative integer
        -   `top` the vertical padding at the top of the dimension, non-negative integer
    -   Can be written as a single non-negative integer instead to be applied to both top and bottom fields
        -   e.g. both `dimension_padding: 10` or `dimension_padding: { bottom: 10, top: 5 }` are valid
-   Data-driven enchantment field `weight` now has an upper bound of 1024
-   Data-driven enchantment field `max_level` now has an upper bound of 255

### Predicates

#### Entity Predicate

-   New option: `movement_affected_by` - optional Location Predicate
    -   When present, adds requirements on a block at most 0.5 blocks below the entity which can affect its movement

# Minecraft Snapshot 24w19b

Oh wow, we never could have guessed you all were so violent! Here's a 24w19b, fixing a crash when a Villager died.

# Minecraft Snapshot 24w19a

The weekend is right around the corner, and what better way to celebrate that fact than by bringing you a serving of Snapshot Friday? This one rounds off the week by introducing performance improvements to chunk loading, alongside the usual assortment of technical improvements and bug fixes.

On another note, last week's Snapshot introduced some changes to the Mace that went undocumented in the 24w18a changelog. That was a whoopsie on our end, and to clear up any confusion we've decided to add those changes to this changelog in addition to updating the previous one. We're sorry about that!

Happy mining!

## Mace changes from 24w18a

-   Raised Mace durability from 250 to 500
-   Reduced Mace base damage to 5
-   Lower the Mace attack speed from -2.4 to -3.5
-   Reduced Density damage per level per block to 0.5
-   Mace Smash attack damage now has a fall off:
    -   First 3 blocks fallen give 4 damage per block
    -   Next 5 blocks fallen give 2 damage per block
    -   Any block fallen after that give 1 damage per block
-   Density and Breach are now incompatible with each other and the other damage enchantments (Smite and Bane of Arthropods)

## Changes

-   Blocks frozen by Frost Walker now emit "Block Placed" vibrations (frequency 13)
-   Changes to sounds
-   Improved chunk loading performance

### Sounds

-   Added 4 new cave ambient sounds
-   Replaced turn off and turn on sounds for Copper Bulb with one toggle sound

### Chunk loading improvements

-   When reading an already generated chunk from disk, surrounding chunks are no longer unnecessarily loaded
    -   This is also visible on the singleplayer world loading screen
-   The new system has less memory and CPU overhead

## Technical Changes

-   Data Pack version is now 43

## Data Pack Version 43

-   The `custom_data` component can now be specified as an SNBT string to preserve type information in JSON
    -   This is the same as is used in the `set_custom_data` loot function and `custom_data` predicate
-   The `food` item component has new fields:
    -   `using_converts_to`: item with components (optional)
        -   Once consumed, the food item will be replaced with the specified item
        -   e.g. `food={nutrition:1,saturation:0,using_converts_to:{id:"poisonous_potato",components:{"minecraft:custom_name":'"Wait what?"'}}}`
-   Registry `decorated_pot_patterns` has been renamed to `decorated_pot_pattern`
-   Removed legacy tag directory names
-   Removed `power` NBT tag and replaced with `acceleration_power` tag with a number value that contol the projectiles acceleration (and maximum speed)
    -   This change affects the following projectiles; `dragon_fireball`, `large_fireball`, `small_fireball`, `fireball`, `breeze_wind_charge`, `wind_charge`, `wither_skull`
-   New NBT tag `dimension_padding` for structures
    -   ensures that a structure is not generating through the edges of a dimension by adding vertical padding to its bounding box
    -   default is 0
    -   Trial Chambers have a padding of 10 since they are generated deep underground and sometimes would intersect with Bedrock layer

### Enchantments

#### Entity Effect Types

-   Added field `trigger_game_event` for effect types `replace_block`, `replace_disc` and `set_block_properties`
    -   Format: Optional Game Event ID for a game event to trigger when a block has been replaced

### Tags

#### Directory renames

-   Some types that used legacy directory names (based on plural name of element) have been renamed to match registry name
-   Affected directories:
    -   `tags/items` -> `tags/item`
    -   `tags/blocks` -> `tags/block`
    -   `tags/entity_types` -> `tags/entity_type`
    -   `tags/fluids` -> `tags/fluid`
    -   `tags/game_events` -> `tags/game_event`

#### Block Tags

-   `fire_aspect_lightable`: All blocks that should be possible to light by hitting with Fire Aspect enchanted tools

#### Damage Type Predicate

-   New option: `is_direct` - optional boolean
    -   When present, requires the damage to be direct (`true`) or indirect (`false`)
    -   Damage is direct when its direct and source entities are the same

    -   `asset_id` - id of sprite in `paintings` atlas

### Enchantments

Enchantments are now set through data. An Enchantment is a set of core properties like level ranges and cost together with some effects. Most effect types also support a set of conditions, making it possible to apply them only when certain criteria are met.

Enchantments can be added in the registry `enchantment`. All Vanilla Enchantments can be found in the vanilla datapack in the client and server jar files.

Fields:

-   `description`: The name of the Enchantment when displayed in text represented as a Text Component
-   `exclusive_set`: The Enchantment(s) this Enchantment is exclusive with
    -   Two Enchantments can never co-exist on an item if either is in the other's exclusive set
    -   Specified as an Enchantment ID, a list of Enchantment IDs or an Enchantment Tag prefixed with `#`
    -   Optional - if omitted, the exclusive set is empty
-   `supported_items`: The item types that can have this Enchantment
    -   Item ID, list of item IDs or tag prefixed with `#`
-   `primary_items`: The item types for which this Enchantment shows up in Enchanting Tables and on traded equipment
    -   Item ID, list of item IDs or tag prefixed with `#`
    -   Must be a subset of `supported_items`
-   `weight`: How commonly the Enchantment appears, compared to the total combined `weight` of all available Enchantments
    -   Positive integer - higher values mean more common
-   `max_level`: The maximum level of the Enchantment
    -   All Enchantments range from level 1 to their maximum level
    -   Positive integer
-   `min_cost`, `max_cost`: describe the range of costs for this Enchantment in the Enchanting Table (and how much it returns when disenchanted)
    -   Both min and max cost are described using a linear formula:
    -   `base`: Base cost at level 1
    -   `per_level_above_first`: Added for each level over 1
-   `anvil_cost`: The fee taken for the Enchantment in the anvil
    -   Non-negative integer
    -   This value is halved when an Enchantment is added to a book
    -   The effective fee is multiplied by the level of the Enchantment
-   `slots`: A list of slot groups this Enchantment works in
    -   Each entry is one of `any`, `hand`, `mainhand`, `offhand`, `armor`, `feet`, `legs`, `chest`, `head` and `body`
-   `effects`: A map of effect components, as described below in the Effect Components section

#### Level-Based Values

Many effects of Enchantments depend on the level of the Enchantment. For these fields, a type called Level-Based Values is used. In their most basic form, Level-Based Values can be written as floating-point constants, which is interpreted as a value that isn't in fact level-based, the constant is used as-is for all levels.

If a Level-Based value is not a floating-point constant, it is an object with a `type` field, specifying one of the following types.

##### `linear`

The most common type of Level-Based Value is a `linear` value. A `linear` Level-Based Value has two fields:

-   `base`: The base value added to all levels
-   `per_level_above_first`: Amount added for each level above the first one

In effect, a `linear` Level-Based Value results in `base + per_level_above_first * (level - 1)`.

##### `clamped`

A Level-Based Value type that clamps a value between a min and max. Fields:

-   `value`: A Level-Based Value used as the input
-   `min`: A floating point value specifying the minimum value of the output
-   `max`: A floating point value specifying the maximum value of the output

##### `fraction`

A Level-Based Value type that represents the fraction between two values. Fields:

-   `numerator`: A Level-Based Value used as the numerator
-   `denominator`: A Level-Based Value used as the denominator

##### `levels_squared`

A Level-Based Value type that evaluates to the square of the levels, plus an addition. Fields:

-   `added`: A floating-point value added to the result of the squared levels

In effect, a `levels_squared` Level-Based Value results in `level ^ 2 + added`

#### Value Effect Types

Value Effects are effects used to manipulate the amount of _something_ in the game.

##### `add`

A Value Effect that adds a value to the processed results.

Fields:

-   `value`: A Level-Based Value determining how much to add
    -   Negative values are supported

##### `all_of`

A Value Effect that runs a number of other Value Effects, in order. This can be useful when the same set of conditions apply to a number of Value Effects.

Fields:

-   `effects`: A list of the Value Effects to run

##### `multiply`

A Value Effect that multiplies the processed value by a given factor.

Fields:

-   `factor`: A Level-Based Value determining the factor to multiply in

##### `remove_binomial`

A Value Effect that runs a Binomial series of checks, reducing the input value by 1 for every successful check.

Fields:

-   `chance`: A Level-Based Value representing the chance that an input value is dropped.
    -   The span is 0 to 1, with 0 being no chance to drop an input value and 1 dropping all input values

##### `set`

A Value Effect that overwrites the input value with a given Level-Based Value.

Fields:

-   `value`: The Level-Based Value to use as the result

#### Attribute Effects

Attribute effects use the Attribute system to apply an Attribute Modifier whenever the Enchanted Item is correctly equipped. Attribute effects do not have a dynamic type - they are all the same type.

Fields:

-   `name`: The name of the Attribute Modifier to add
-   `attribute`: The ID of the attribute to modify
-   `operation`: The operation of the Attribute Modifier
    -   One of `add_value`, `add_multiplied_base` and `add_multiplied_total`
-   `amount`: A Level-Based Value describing the amount
-   `uuid`: A string containing a UUID for the Attribute Modifier to use
    -   Must be unique to avoid different Enchantments (or other systems) interfering with each others

#### Entity Effect Types

Entity Effects are Enchantment effects that generally do something to an Entity involved in an event. Which Entity is affected depends on the specific component being configured.

##### `all_of`

An Entity Effect that runs a list of other Entity Effects. This can be useful when a set of conditions should apply to more than one Entity Effect.

Fields:

-   `effects`: List of Entity Effects to run

##### `apply_mob_effect`

An Entity Effect that applies a random Mob Effect to the affected Entity, chosen from a set of options. The duration and amplifier are randomized within a given span. The effect of specifying larger maximum values than the minimum value is undefined.

Fields:

-   `to_apply`: Options for the Effect to apply
    -   One of an Effect ID, a list of Effect IDs or an Effect Tag prefixed by `#`
-   `min_duration`, `max_duration`: Level-Based Values representing the minimum and maximum duration of the effect in seconds
-   `min_amplifier`, `max_amplifier`: Level-Based Values representing the minimum and maximum amplifier

##### `damage_entity`

An Entity Effect that applies damage to the affected Entity. The amount of damage is randomized within a given span. The effect of specifying a larger maximum value than the minimum value is undefined.

Fields:

-   `damage_type`: The ID of the Damage Type to use
-   `min_damage`, `max_damage`: Level-Based Values representing the minimum and maximum amount of damage

##### `damage_item`

An Entity Effect that applies damage to the Enchanted Item.

Fields:

-   `amount`: A Level-Based Value determining the amount of damage to apply

##### `explode`

An Entity Effect that causes an explosion.

Fields:

All Entity Effect types can also be used as Location-Based Effects, and in addition `attribute` can be used to specify an Attribute Effect as a location-based effect.

#### Effect Conditions

Most Enchantment effects are filtered using Conditions (same types as in loot tables). This enables effects to be specific for different situations. Each Effect Component defines which parameters are available for the condition to evaluate - some parameters are available for all of these parameter sets, while some are specific to a certain set.

Each effect component specifies which parameters are available in the [Effect Components](#effect-components) list below.

##### Damage Parameters

-   Entities: `this`, `attacker`, `direct_attacker`

-   Origin
-   Damage Source

##### Item Parameters

#### Effect Components

The `effects` field in an Enchantment is a map of Effect Component type the Effect List data. Most Effect Components are lists, so any number of Effects can be added of any Component Type. The data for each effect generally involves having a specified condition context and Effect Type, but some Effects also deviate from this format.

In cases where the documentation specifies a Condition Context and Effect, the Component is a list. Each entry in the list has a field named `effect` with the effect of the type used by the list. Entries can also optionally include a field named `requirements` specifying the condition parameters, which are then evaluated with the documented context.

-   The `saturation_modifier` field on the `food` component has been replaced with `saturation`
    -   `saturation` is the exact value added to the player's saturation level
    -   In respect to the former `saturation_modifier`, this is defined by `saturation = nutrition * saturation_modifier * 2`
-   Particle representation in commands and area effect clouds has been changed
-   Changed optional `equipment_loot_table` field in the `SpawnPotentials` of Monster Spawners and `spawn_potentials` of Trial Spawner configs

        -   `loot_table` - A loot table used to generate the equipment
        -   `slot_drop_chances` - An optional map of equipment slot to specified drop chance
            -   Can also be a single value instead of a list to apply to all slots: e.g. `slot_drop_chances: 0.0f` will apply a chance of 0% to all slots
    -   e.g. `equipment: {loot_table: "minecraft:equipment/trial_chamber", slot_drop_chances: {"head": 0.0f, "chest": 0.25f, "legs": 1.0f, "feet": 0.25f}}`
    -   If present, rolled items from the specified loot table will be equipped to the mob that spawns
-   Removed Item tag `minecraft:tools` (overlapping with `minecraft:breaks_decorated_pots`)
-   Added Entity Type tag `minecraft:punchable_projectiles` for projectiles which should be able to be punched and deflected toward the direction the player is looking
-   Added Enchantment tag `minecraft:tooltip_order` controlling which order Enchantments are listed in tooltips

    -   Describes target component to be filled with items
    -   Existing contents will be replaced
    -   Allowed values: `container`, `bundle_contents`, `charged_projectiles`
    -   `bundle_contents` and `charged_projectiles` will ignore empty stacks

#### `set_custom_data`

Field `tag` now accepts both SNBT data written as a string (existing format) and unflattened tags

### New Loot Functions

#### `modify_contents`

-   Apply modifier function to every item inside a component
-   If component does not exist, it will not be added
-   Fields:
    -   `conditions`\- list of conditions to filter this function
    -   `component` - target component
        -   Allowed values: `container`, `bundle_contents`, `charged_projectiles`
    -   `modifier` - function or list of functions to be applied to every item inside container

#### `set_item`

-   Replaces item type of item stack without changing count and components
-   Fields:
    -   `conditions` - list of conditions to filter this function
    -   `item` - new item type

#### `filtered`

-   Applies sub-function only to items that match item predicate
-   Fields:
    -   `conditions` - list of conditions to filter this function
    -   `item_filter` - item predicate used to match items
    -   `modifier` - functions to apply to matching items

#### `set_custom_model_data`

-   Sets `custom_model_data` component
-   Fields:
    -   `conditions` - list of conditions to filter this function
    -   `value` - integer number provider

### New Item Sub-predicates

General rules of component predicates:

-   Unless otherwise specified, a field in predicate with the same name as a field in component that matches (i.e. has the same name as predicate) will match that field value
-   Those fields will usually have the same type as in the components, but will be optional.
-   Exceptions:
    -   List fields will be replaced with collection matchers (see below)
    -   Integer and float fields will be replaced with ranges
    -   Registry ids will be replaced with a type that accepts id, list of ids or a tag

#### Collection matcher

Collection matcher is a shared part of predicate used for matching collections. Every instance of this matcher will have same fields with same functionality, with only difference being type of matched element Fields:

-   `size` - integer range to match against collection size
-   `contains` - a list of element predicates
    -   All conditions must match for predicate to pass
    -   Not all elements in tested container have to be matched
    -   Elements can be in any order
    -   Single element can match multiple predicates
    -   Examples (when matching item stacks):
        -   `{contents:[{item:diamond}]}` - will match when there is at least one diamond item
        -   `{contents:[{item:diamond}, {item:dirt}]}` - will match when there is at least one diamond item and at least one dirt item
-   `count` - a list of matchers on element counts
    -   Entry fields:
        -   `test` - element matcher
        -   `count` - optional integer range to check against number of elements passing `test`
    -   Examples (when matching item stacks):
        -   `{count:[{count:3,test:{items:diamond}}]}}` will match only when there are exactly 3 stacks of diamonds (no matter the stack size)

#### `container`

-   Matcher for `container` component (like shulker box)
-   Fields:
    -   `items` - optional collection matcher
        -   Note: empty items are ignored. That means `container~{items:{size:3}}` will only pass if there are exactly 3 non-empty stacks in container

### `bundle_contents`

-   Matcher for `bundle_contents` component
-   Fields:
    -   `items` - optional collection matcher

### `firework_explosion`

-   Matcher for `firework_explosion` component
-   Fields
    -   `shape` - optional matcher for shape, same values as `shape` field in `minecraft:firework_explosion` component
    -   `has_trail` - optional boolean
    -   `has_twinkle` - optional boolean

### `fireworks`

-   Matcher for `fireworks` component
-   Fields:
    -   `explosions` - optional collection matcher for `firework_explosion` predicates
    -   `flight_duration` - optional integer range check for flight duration
-   Example: `minecraft:fireworks~{explosions:{contains:[{shape:small_ball}]}}]` - matches if firework has at least one explosion with `small_ball` shape

### `writable_book_content`

-   Matcher for `writable_book_content` component
-   Fields
    -   `pages` - optional collection matcher for strings (matching only unfiltered contents of page)

### `fireworks`

-   Matcher for `written_book_content` component
-   Fields
    -   `pages` - optional collection matcher for chat components (matching only unfiltered contents of page)
    -   `author` - optional string value
    -   `title` - optional string value (matching only value)
    -   `generation` - optional integer range check for generation
    -   `resolved` - optional boolean

### `attribute_modifiers`

-   Matcher for `attribute_modifiers` component
-   Fields:
    -   `modifiers` - optional collection matcher for following entries with following fields:
        -   `attribute` - optional id, list of ids or tag for attribute to be matched
        -   `id` - optional UUID
        -   `name` - optional string
        -   `amount` - optional double range check
        -   `operation` - optional operation type (same values as `operation` field from `attribute_modifiers` component)
        -   `slot` - optional applicable slot type (same values as `slot` field from `attribute_modifiers` component)

### `trim`

-   Matcher for `trim` component
-   Fields:
    -   `material` - optional id, list of ids or tag for material to be matched
    -   `pattern` - optional id, list of ids or tag for pattern to be matched

### Particle representation

-   Particle options in commands and in fields like `Particles` in Area Effect clouds now use the same representation as worldgen files (like existing biomes' ambient particle settings)
-   For example, command `/particle minecraft:dust 1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 ...` becomes `/particle minecraft:dust{color:[1.0, 0.0, 0.0], scale:2.0} ...`
-   The syntax for particles without extra options (like `minecraft:villager`) remains unchanged
-   Changes to block particles (`minecraft:block`, `minecraft:block_marker`, `minecraft:falling_dust`, `minecraft:dust_pillar`) options:
    -   Field `value` has been renamed to `block_state`
    -   Field `block_state` now also accepts plain block name to represent default block state
    -   Example transformations:
        -   `minecraft:block minecraft:redstone_lamp[lit=true]` -> `minecraft:block{block_state: {Name: "minecraft:redstone_lamp", Properties: {lit: "true"}}}`
        -   `minecraft:block minecraft:diamond_block` -> `minecraft:block{block_state: "minecraft:diamond_block"}`
-   Changes to `minecraft:item` options:
    -   Field `value` has been renamed to `item`
    -   Field `item` now also accepts plain item name to represent item stack with default components
    -   `count` field is now ignored
    -   Example transformations:
        -   `minecraft:item minecraft:dirt` -> `minecraft:item{item: {id: "minecraft:dirt"}}`
        -   `minecraft:item minecraft:dirt` -> `minecraft:item{item: "minecraft:dirt"}`
-   Changes to `dust_color_transition` options:
    -   Field `fromColor` has been renamed to `from_color`
    -   Field `toColor` has been renamed to `to_color`
    -   Example transformation: `dust_color_transition 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.5 0.0 1.0 0.5` -> `dust_color_transition{from_color: [1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f], scale: 0.5f, to_color: [0.0f, 1.0f, 0.5f]}`
-   Changes to `entity_effect` options:
    -   Field `value` has been renamed to `color`
    -   Field `color` now also accepts list of floats representing RGBA color

# Minecraft Snapshot 24w13a

This fine Wednesday brings 24w13a, a snapshot containing changes to the Mace, Trial Chambers, and introduces the new Ominous Trials!

You might just be inclined to try out the ominous new features of this snapshot. ...or else? Did I do that right?

Happy mining!

Note: some of the features below will only work in freshly generated Trial Chambers.

## Experimental Features

-   Changes to the Mace
-   Tweaks to the Breeze and Wind Charges
-   Redesigned Bad Omen
-   Added Ominous Bottle
-   Added 6 new mob effects
-   Added Ominous Trial Spawner
-   Added Ominous Vault
-   Added Ominous Trial Key

### Mace

-   Added a new explosive particle effect when executing a smash attack with the Mace to really show the player's power
-   Increased the power and range of the knockback effect from a smash attack
-   Introduced an even stronger knockback when falling for more than 5 blocks before attacking
-   When successfully striking a target, all vertical momentum will be reset in addition to negating any accumulated fall distance
-   The baseline additional damage dealt by the Mace smash attack has been slightly reduced to 3 (1.5 hearts) per fallen block
-   These existing enchantments can now be applied to the Mace:
    -   Mending
    -   Unbreaking
    -   Smite
    -   Bane of Arthropods
    -   Fire Aspect
    -   Curse of Vanishing
-   Three new enchantments have been introduced that are unique to the Mace:
    -   Density:
        -   Common Enchantment, accessible in the Enchanting Table and on Enchanted Books in loot
        -   Has 5 levels
        -   Maces enchanted with Density do more damage per fallen block per Density level
            -   Damage dealt per fallen block is increased by 1 per level of Density
    -   Breach:
        -   Rare Enchantment, accessible in the Enchanting Table and on Enchanted Books in loot
        -   Has 4 levels
        -   Maces enchanted with Breach reduce the effectiveness of armor on the target
            -   The effectiveness of the armor is reduced by 15% per Breach level
    -   Wind Burst:
        -   Unique enchantment which can only be found in Ominous Vaults
        -   Has 3 levels
        -   Maces enchanted with Wind Burst will emit a Wind Burst upon hitting an enemy, launching the attacker upward and enabling the linking of smash attacks one after the other
        -   Each level will bounce the attacker higher up in the air

### Breeze & Wind Charges

-   The Breeze now avoids jumping into dangerous blocks or air
-   Wind Charges no longer collide with End Crystals

### Ominous Events

-   Bad Omen has been expanded to give access to an optional experience in Trial Chambers
-   These optional experiences accessed through Bad Omen are now known as Ominous Events
    -   They are more challenging than usual, and are designed to shake up the experience in unique ways
    -   Illager Raids are an example of an existing Ominous Event
-   Bad Omen is getting some changes with this redesign:
    -   It has a new, shadowy icon and a sound for being applied to the player
    -   It no longer triggers a Raid directly when entering a village
        -   Instead, it will transform into a Raid Omen variant with a duration of 30 seconds
        -   Once the Raid Omen expires, a Raid will start at the location the player gained the Raid Omen
        -   Like any other effect, players can drink a Bucket of Milk to clear the Raid Omen to prevent the Raid from starting
    -   It is no longer given to players that defeat a Raid Captain outside a Raid
        -   Instead, players can gain access to Bad Omen by consuming a new Ominous Bottle

#### Ominous Bottle

-   An item which can be consumed by players to receive the Bad Omen effect for 1 hour and 40 minutes
    -   Comes in 5 variations, one for each Bad Omen level
    -   The bottle breaks when consumed
    -   Can be stacked to 64
-   Can be found uncommonly in any Vaults that are unlocked with Trial Keys, and is dropped by Raid Captains when defeated outside a Raid

### Ominous Trials

-   A new Ominous Event that can be accessed by exploring a Trial Chamber with Bad Omen
-   This event will have players facing more powerful Trial Spawners if they dare!

#### Trial Omen

-   A variant that Bad Omen can transform into
    -   This occurs when the player is within detection range of a Trial Spawner that is not Ominous
    -   The Trial Omen has a duration of 15 minutes multiplied by the transformed Bad Omen's level
-   Players that have Trial Omen are surrounded by ominous particles

#### Ominous Trial Spawner

-   A more powerful active phase of the Trial Spawner with unique challenges and rewards
    -   Provides a more challenging experience that advanced players can opt into for better rewards
-   If a Trial Spawner detects a player that has the Trial Omen effect, the spawner will become Ominous if:
    -   It is not in cooldown
    -   Or, it is in cooldown but was not Ominous during its last activation
        -   Making it Ominous this way will bypass the cooldown
-   While active, it will:
    -   Glow blue instead of orange
    -   Emit soul flames instead of normal flames
    -   Very commonly spawns mobs with equipment if they can wear it
        -   The equipment these mobs wear have armor trims applied from the Trial Chambers
        -   Known issue: these mobs can currently drop their equipment on death, but they will not in the future
    -   Periodically spawn potions and projectiles on top of unsuspecting players and mobs
        -   Based on their location, spawners in an area will select a random set of projectiles to spawn
        -   These projectiles will always include a single type of Lingering Potion from a set of possible effects
-   Becoming Ominous will despawn any existing mobs it spawned and reset its challenge
    -   It will stay Ominous until it has been defeated and its cooldown has finished
-   When defeated, it will eject a different set of loot to normal Trial Spawners

#### Ominous Trial Key

-   A new variant of the Trial Key which can only be obtained by defeating an Ominous Trial Spawner
-   They can be used to unlock Ominous Vaults

#### Ominous Vault

-   A variant of Vaults that have a different texture and emit soul flames instead of normal flames
-   These can be found throughout the Trial Chambers in harder to find places and require an Ominous Trial Key to unlock
    -   These Vaults hold a more valuable set of rewards than the standard Vaults unlocked by Trial Keys

### Mob Effects

-   The following effects have been added:
    -   Wind Charged
        -   Affected entities will emit a wind burst upon death
        -   Brewed with an Awkward Potion and a Breeze Rod
    -   Weaving
        -   Affected entities will spread Cobweb blocks upon death
        -   Non-player entities with this effect can walk through Cobweb at normal speeds
        -   Brewed with an Awkward Potion and a Cobweb block
    -   Oozing
        -   Affected entities will spawn two Slimes upon death
        -   Brewed with an Awkward Potion and a Slime Block
    -   Infested
        -   Affected entities have a 5% chance to spawn 1-2 Silverfish when hurt
        -   Brewed with an Awkward Potion and a Stone block
-   These effects can be encountered while taking on an Ominous Trial Spawner
-   Some mobs are immune to these effects
    -   Slimes are immune to Oozing
    -   Silverfish are immune to Infested

### Trial Chambers Loot

-   The loot found within Trial Chamber Vaults has been adjusted
-   Standard Vaults will give slightly less items of high quality, but also include the following changes:
    -   Ominous Bottle I - II can be found
    -   Flow Banner Pattern, Flow Armor Trim Smithing Template, and Heavy Core can no longer be obtained
        -   Guster Banner Pattern and Bolt Armor Trim Smithing Template remain exclusive to standard Vaults
        -   In Heavy Core's place, standard Vaults will instead have a very rare chance of providing a Trident
-   Ominous Vaults can provide some particularly valuable items, to mention a few:
    -   Ominous Bottle III - V
    -   Enchanted Golden Apple
    -   Flow Banner Pattern and Flow Armor Trim Smithing Template
    -   Wind Burst, Breach and Density Enchantments for the Mace
    -   Heavy Core
-   The loot ejected from Trial Spawners have been adjusted
    -   It now has a focus on providing higher quality food more often to make replenishing between fights more safe
-   Ominous Trial Keys have a 30% chance of ejecting from a defeated Ominous Trial Spawner, replacing the usual 50% chance to eject Trial Keys

### Trial Spawner

-   All spawners now increase the amount of mobs present at once by 0.5 for each additional player, down from 2
-   Baby Zombie spawners now only have 2 mobs present at once for its baseline, down from 3 mobs
-   Can now only activate when a player is in line of sight

### Trial Chambers

-   Remade `chamber_5` with variations, and renamed it to `eruption`
-   Reduced amount of Trial Spawners in corridors
-   Updated layout and placements of Vaults
-   Placed Ominous Vaults in chambers, intersections, at the ends of corridors
-   Corridors will no longer generate endlessly
-   Added an atrium to the corridors
-   Made various layout changes in intersections and corridors

Known issues:

-   Corner quadrants in slanted may still fail to generate correctly

## Changes in 24w13a

-   Added unique sounds for Cobwebs

## Technical Changes in 24w13a

-   The Data Pack version is now 37
-   The Resource Pack version is now 31
-   Client chat state is now preserved by default when entering configuration phase
-   Changes to chat network protocol

### Chat

-   Client chat state (on-screen messages and chat input history) is now preserved by client when entering and exiting configuration phase
-   Message signature chain handling remains unchanged - going into configuration phase starts new session
-   If client has message delay configured, pending messages will be delivered immediately before leaving world
-   Server can clear chat state by sending `reset_chat` packet in configuration phase

### Network Protocol

-   The `minecraft:chat_command_signed` packet has been split from `minecraft:chat_command`
    -   Commands that do not accept any signed arguments will use the unsigned packet, and will not pass any 'last seen' chat updates

## Data Pack Version 37

-   Added new loot table type `minecraft:equipment`
    -   Has required parameters of `this_entity` and `origin`
        -   `this_entity` : the mob that is about to be given equipment
        -   `origin` : the position of the mob
-   Added optional `equipment_loot_table` to the spawn data present in the `SpawnPotentials` of Monster Spawners and `spawn_potentials` of Trial Spawner configs
    -   If present, rolled items from the specified loot table will be equipped to the mob that spawns
-   Modified `copy_components` and `set_name` loot function arguments
-   Added new `set_ominous_bottle_amplifier` loot function
-   Added new item components
-   Non-default components on item stacks are now stored when block entity is placed
-   Int and float providers used in worldgen definitions are no longer wrapped in an extra `value` field next to `type`
    -   For example, `{"type":"minecraft:uniform","value":{"min_inclusive":0.0,"max_inclusive":1.0}}` becomes `{"type":"minecraft:uniform","min_inclusive":0.0,"max_inclusive":1.0}`
-   New Damage Type Tag: `minecraft:is_player_attack` for attacks performed by the player
-   New Entity Type Tags:
    -   `immune_to_oozing` For entities that cannot receive the Oozing mob effect
    -   `immune_to_infested` For entities that cannot receive the Infested mob effect
-   Added `raider` sub entity predicate

### Block entities

Non-default components on item stacks containing block items are now stored on block entities when placed

-   Component removals from defaults are currently not preserved
-   Placing and breaking non-block entity blocks remains unchanged - nothing is preserved
-   Does not automatically cause preserved components to be restored on drops - this requires addition of `copy_components` function to loot table
-   Components are stored in field called `components`
    -   Some components (like `custom_name`) are still handled by legacy serialization, which means they might not be present in there
    -   Contains map of component id to component value

### New Item Stack Components

#### `minecraft:item_name`

-   When present, replaces default item name with contained chat component
-   Differences from `custom_name`:
    -   `item_name` can't be changed or removed in anvil
    -   `item_name` is not styled with italics when displayed to player
    -   `item_name` does not show labels where applicable (for example: banner markers, names in item frames)

#### `minecraft:ominous_bottle_amplifier`

-   Controls the amplifier amount for an Ominous Bottle's bad omen effect
-   Format: integer between 0 and 4
    -   e.g. `ominous_bottle_amplifier=3`

### Loot Functions

#### `copy_components`

Removed field `components` and replaced it with:

-   `include` - optional list of data components to be copied from source
    -   if omitted, all components present are included
-   `exclude` - optional list of data components to be excluded from copying
    -   if omitted, defaults to empty
-   Only components that are included (explicitly or implicitly) but not excluded will be copied

#### `set_name`

Added optional field `target` to specify which name should be set

-   Values:
    -   `custom_name` - sets `custom_name` component (default)
    -   `item_name` - sets `item_name` component

#### Added `set_ominous_bottle_amplifier`

Sets the `ominous_bottle_amplifier` component on the target item according to a number provider.

-   `conditions`: list of conditions to filter this function
-   `amplifier`: a number provider used to generate the `ominous_bottle_amplifier` component

#### Entity sub-predicates

##### `raider`

New `raider` sub-predicate has been added to match raiders Fields:

-   `has_raid` - Match whether the raider is in an active raid
-   `is_captain` - Match whether the raider is a captain

## Resource Pack Version 31

-   Added the following particle types:
    -   `infested`
    -   `item_cobweb`
    -   `small_gust`
    -   `raid_omen`
    -   `trial_omen`

    -   `block.cobweb.break`
    -   `block.cobweb.step`
    -   `block.cobweb.place`
    -   `block.cobweb.hit`
    -   `block.cobweb.fall`
    -   `block.trial_spawner.about_to_spawn_item`
    -   `block.trial_spawner.spawn_item`
    -   `block.trial_spawner.spawn_item_begin`
    -   `block.trial_spawner.charge_activate`
    -   `block.trial_spawner.ambient_charged`
    -   `item.ominous_bottle.dispose`
    -   `event.mob_effect.bad_omen`
    -   `event.mob_effect.trial_omen`
    -   `event.mob_effect.raid_omen`
-   Added textures for the following blocks and items:
    -   Ominous Vault
    -   Ominous Trial Spawner
    -   Ominous Bottle
-   Updated textures for normal Vault block

# Minecraft Snapshot 24w12a

Here's snapshot 24w12a with new advancements and several tweaks.

Happy Mining!

## Experimental Features

### Trial Chambers

Trial Chambers now generate slightly more rarely and a bit more spaced out from each other

### Trial Chambers Explorer Map

-   Struggle no more to locate a Trial Chamber - level up your nearest Cartographer to Journeyman for the opportunity to trade for an Explorer Map pointing to a nearby Trial Chamber

### Heavy Core

-   Can now be waterlogged
-   Survives lava flows
-   Most efficient tool is now the pickaxe
-   Adjusted destroy time and explosion resistance

### Advancements

-   Added the following advancements:
    -   `Minecraft: Trial(s) Edition` - Step foot in a Trial Chamber
    -   `Under Lock & Key` - Unlock a Vault using a Trial Key
    -   `[Challenge - 40 exp] Blowback` - Kill a Breeze with a deflected Wind Charge

    -   `Lighten Up` - Scrape a Copper Bulb with an Axe to make it brighter
    -   `Over-Overkill` - Deal 50 hearts of damage in a single hit using the Mace

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 36
-   The Resource Pack version is now 30
-   -   Particle `entity_effect` takes color argument when spawned from command
    -   `/particle entity_effect <r> <g> <b> <a>`
    -   4 float values ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 representing RGBA

## Data Pack Version 36

-   Added a `crafter_recipe_crafted` trigger which is triggered when a Crafter ejects a successfully crafted item into the world.
    -   `<player>` an entity predicate matching the player who is nearby
    -   `<recipe_id>` is the ID of the recipe being crafted
    -   `<ingredients>` is a list of item predicates matching the ingredients that form the recipe being crafted
-   Added a `fall_after_explosion` trigger which is triggered when a player begins falling after being knocked upwards by an explosion or wind burst
    -   `<player>` an entity predicate matching the player who is falling
    -   `<start_position>` a location predicate matching the position the player was at when they were hit by the explosion or burst
    -   `<distance>` a distance predicate matching how far the player must be from `start_position` to cause the trigger to activate
    -   `<cause>` an entity predicate matching the entity which caused the explosion or burst to happen
-   Added `storage` loot number provider to access values from command storage
-   New Entity Type Tag: `sensitive_to_smite` - for Entity Types that take extra damage from the Smite Enchantment
-   Expanded item predicate syntax used in `execute if|unless items` and `clear` commands
-   Removed redundant custom data section (`{...}`) from item arguments (it's fully replaced by `[custom_data={...}]`)
    -   To make this transition easier, `custom_data` item sub-predicate has been changed to allow unquoted SNBT
-   Added `wolf` entity sub-predicate for matching wolf variants
-   `wolf`, `cat`, `frog` and `painting` entity sub-predicates now accept tags and plain lists instead of just single elements
-   Changed texture asset paths in `wolf_variant` to better match other formats
-   Command arguments that previously accepted namespaced ids of loot tables, modifiers and predicates can now also accept inline definitions
-   Added new item stack components
-   Added new loot functions

### `wolf_variant` definitions

-   Field `texture` has been renamed to `wild_texture`
-   `wild_texture`, `tame_texture` and `angry_texture` no longer require values to be prefixed with `textures/` and suffixed with `.png`

### Commands

#### Inline loot values

Arguments in following commands that previously accepted namespaced ids of loot tables, modifiers and predicates can now also accept inline definitions:

-   `loot`
-   `item`
-   `execute if predicate` Values have same structure as matching JSON files, though they are encoded as SNBT. Example: `execute if predicate {condition:weather_check, raining:true}`

### Loot tables

#### `storage` number provider

-   This number provider is able to access numeric values from command storage directly
-   If selected storage does not exist or tag selected by path is not numeric or does not exist, provider returns 0
-   Fields:
    -   `storage` - namespaced id of command storage
    -   `path` - NBT path to field

#### `set_lore` function

-   The `replace` field has been removed
-   Now has `mode` like `set_fireworks` and `set_written_book_pages`

#### `set_written_book_pages` function

-   `pages` is now a JSON Object rather than a string containing JSON

#### `toggle_tooltips` loot function

-   This function can be used to modify item component tooltip visiblity
-   It works by setting fields like `show_in_tooltip` without changing other values
-   Format:
    -   `toggles` - a map of supported item component type to boolean value
-   Supported components: `trim`, `dyed_color`, `enchantments`, `stored_enchantments`, `unbreakable`, `can_break`, `can_place_on`, `attribute_modifiers`
-   Example:
    -   `{function:"toggle_tooltips","toggles":{"enchantments":false}}` will hide enchantments tooltip

#### Functions

-   Nested lists are no longer supported in function lists

### Item predicate argument

The item predicate syntax (used in `execute if|unless items` and `clear` commands) has been significantly expanded.

-   The general syntax is: `<type> [comma-separated list of <test>]`
-   `<type>` can be one of:
    -   item id
    -   item tag id prefixed with `#`
    -   `*` to match any item
-   `<test>` can have one of 3 forms:
    -   `<component_id>=<value>` - match exact value of component (same as in previous format)
        -   `<value>` is a representation of component value in SNBT format (same as in `item give` argument)
    -   `<component_id>` - check if component exists
    -   `<predicate_id>~<value>` - check item sub-predicate
        -   `<value>` is a representation of item sub-predicate in SNBT format (but otherwise same as one used for advancement and loot table JSON files)
        -   Example: `*[damage~{durability:{min:3}}]` will match any stack with at least 3 uses left
-   The special name `minecraft:count` can be used for matching the stack size
    -   `count=<positive int>` will pass only when the stack size equals the given value
    -   `count~<int range>` will pass when the stack size is in the specified range
        -   Example: `*[count~{max:2}]` will match any stack with count <= 2
    -   `count` will always pass
-   Any `<test>` entry can be negated by prefixing with `!`
    -   Example: `*[!count=1]` will match any stack that has count other than 1
-   `<test>` elements can be also joined with `|` to check multiple alternatives
    -   Example: `*[!damage|damage=0]` will look for items without damage component or with `0` damage
-   The syntax for custom data partial matching (`{}`) has been removed in favor of using `custom_data` predicates
    -   So `stick{a:2}` becomes `stick[custom_data~{a:2}]`

### Predicates

#### Item sub-predicates

-   Predicate `minecraft:custom_data` now accepts both SNBT data written as a string (existing format) and unflattened tags
    -   That means that `*[custom_data~{a:1}]` and `*[custom_data~"{a:1}"]` are equivalent
    -   Flattened string format has been kept since NBT type information can't be expressed in JSON

#### Entity sub-predicates

##### `wolf`

New `wolf` sub-predicate has been added to match wolf variants Fields:

-   `variant` - wolf variant to match (single entry, list of entries or tag)

##### `cat`, `frog`, `painting`

-   Field `variant` now accepts single entries, list of entries or tags

### New Item Stack Components

#### `minecraft:food`

-   When present, this item will behave as if a food (can be eaten)
-   Format: object with fields
    -   `nutrition`: non-negative integer, number of food points to restore when eaten
    -   `saturation_modifier`: float, amount of saturation to restore when eaten
    -   `is_meat`: boolean (default: `false`)
        -   If `true`, can be fed to Wolves

        -   If `true`, this food can be eaten even if not hungry
    -   `eat_seconds`: float (default: `1.6`)
        -   The number of seconds that it takes to eat this food item
    -   `effects`: list of effects to apply when eaten (default: `[]`)
        -   `effect`: effect instance (same format as `custom_effects` in `minecraft:potion_contents` component)
        -   `probability`: float between 0 and 1, chance for the effect to be applied (default: `1`)
    -   e.g: `food={nutrition:4,saturation_modifier:0.1}`
-   On food items, has an implicit default value for that food type

#### `minecraft:max_stack_size`

-   Controls the maximum stacking size of this item
-   Format: integer between 1 and 99
    -   e.g. `max_stack_size=4`
-   Has an implicit default value according to the item type (usually `64`)

#### `minecraft:max_damage`

-   Controls the maximum amount of damage than an item can take
-   If not present, the item cannot be damaged
-   Format: positive integer
    -   e.g. `max_damage=123`

    -   `common` (default): white name, or aqua when enchanted
    -   `uncommon`: yellow name, or aqua when enchanted
    -   `rare`: aqua name, or light purple when enchanted
    -   `epic`: light purple name
    -   e.g. `rarity=rare`
-   Special items such as Golden Apples have an implicit default value

#### `minecraft:tool`

-   Controls the behavior of the item as a tool
-   Format: object with fields
    -   `rules`: list of rule entries
        -   `blocks`: single block, list of blocks, or `#`\-prefixed block tag to match
        -   `speed` (optional): float, overrides the mining speed if present and matched
        -   `correct_for_drops` (optional): boolean, overrides whether this tool is considered 'correct' if present and matched

# Minecraft Snapshot 24w11a

Oh look, it's a rare case of snapshot Thursday! This week we're expanding your arsenal with a smashing new weapon, the Mace! Use this weapon's special smash attack while leaping from a high place and watch your enemies get knocked back. The longer you fall, the harder you hit – but make sure you time it right! Your fall damage is only negated if you land the blow. Craft this new weapon by combining a Breeze Rod with the Heavy Core, a new item you can find by unlocking Trial Chamber Vaults.

As usual, we invite you to share your thoughts about this new feature over at the feedback site: [Let's talk about the Mace!](https://aka.ms/mcmacefeedback)

Alongside this hefty new mob swatter, we're also bringing you new chambers and variations to Trial Chambers, updated loot tables for Vaults, new Pottery Sherds, Armor Trims and Banner Patterns—as well as the usual slew of bug fixes and polish.

Happy mace-ing!

## Experimental Features

-   Added the Mace
-   Added Breeze Rod
-   Added Heavy Core
-   Added 2 new Armor Trims
-   Added 3 new Pottery Sherds
-   Added 2 new Banner Patterns
-   Updated Vault loot table
-   Updated Trial Chambers

## Blocks

### Heavy Core

-   A mysterious, dense block which can be combined with a Breeze Rod to craft a brand-new weapon: the Mace!

## Items

### Breeze Rod

-   An item dropped by the Breeze that can be crafted into 4 Wind Charges, or used with the Heavy Core to craft the Mace

### Mace

-   A new heavy weapon to smash your enemies!
-   Leverage the weight of this new weapon to deal additional damage the farther you fall before hitting your target
    -   Try it out by jumping down toward your target, and hit them before you hit the ground
    -   Successfully striking a target in this way will negate any damage accumulated from the fall, similar to how a Wind Charge works
    -   Other entities near the struck enemy will be knocked back by the immense force of the Mace
-   Using a Mace will decrease its durability like any other weapon; repair it with Breeze Rods at an anvil
-   Players can use a Mace in combination with Wind Charges to launch up and deliver devastating smash attacks on their enemies

## Mobs

### Breeze

-   Drops 1-2 Breeze Rods when killed by a player
    -   The number of Breeze Rods dropped is affected by looting enchantments

### Pottery Sherds

-   Added Flow, Guster, and Scrape Pottery Sherds

### Banner Patterns

-   Added Flow and Guster Banner Patterns

### Armor Trims

-   Added Bolt and Flow Armor Trims and Smithing Templates
-   Bolt can be duplicated using a Copper Block or Waxed Copper
-   Flow can be duplicated using a Breeze Rod

### Trial Chambers

-   Added new chambers and variations, with new challenges
    -   Remade chamber\_9, and renamed it to "slanted"
    -   Remade chamber\_3, and renamed it to "pedestal"
-   Added Flow, Guster, and Scrape Pottery Sherds to the Decorated Pots in the decor structure pool
-   Trial Spawners will now appear more frequently in the corridors
-   Changed the layout of the blocks around the Vaults
-   The loot tables of Vaults in Trial Chambers have been updated to address some inventory management issues
    -   You will now get no more than 1 unstackable item per Vault
    -   You will more often get rewards which can stack together
    -   Horse Armor and Saddles have been removed from the loot table
-   Vaults in Trial Chambers can now eject:
    -   Wind Charges
    -   Bolt Armor Trim Smithing Template
    -   Flow Armor Trim Smithing Template
    -   Flow Banner Pattern
    -   Guster Banner Pattern
    -   Heavy Core

## Changes

-   Adjusted flying behaviour for Bees and Parrot to keep them from overshooting their position when flying up and down
-   Status effect particle colors are no longer blended into one particle color
    -   All active visible status effect particles are now rendered separately
    -   The frequency of emitting status effect particles has been lowered to clutter the screen less
-   Updated the wolf armor crack textures
-   Menu background blur has been updated to look better and be more performant

### Wolf variants

When summon in other ways (e.g. using the Spawn Egg or using the `summon` command), the variant selection follows the natural spawning biome rules with the following extensions:

-   Rusty Wolf: will be selected in all Jungle biomes, including Jungle and Bamboo Jungle Biomes
-   Spotted Wolf: will be selected in all Savanna biomes, including Savanna and Windswept Savanna Biomes
-   Striped Wolf: will be selected in all Badlands biomes, including Badlands and Eroded Badlands Biomes

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 35
-   The Resource Pack version is now 29

## Data Pack Version 35

-   Removed `any` entity sub-predicate
-   Component-specific item predicate properties have been moved to separate field `predicates`
-   Added slot name `contents` for single-slot entities like item frames and item displays
-   Contents of `item` entity can now be accessed through `contents` slot name
-   Added new loot functions

### Predicates

#### Item sub-predicate

-   Some fields from item predicate have been moved to a map in an optional field `predicates`
-   The new field is similar to the `components` field on item stacks
-   This was done to simplify addition for future predicates and to allow sub-predicates to more closely resemble names of components they match
-   The following fields have been moved:
    -   `enchantments` - field moved to sub-predicate `minecraft:enchantments`
    -   `stored_enchantments` - field moved to sub-predicate `minecraft:stored_enchantments`
    -   `potions` - field moved to sub-predicate `minecraft:potion_contents`
    -   `custom_data` - field moved to sub-predicate `minecraft:custom_data`
-   `durability` field has been expanded to `minecraft:damage` predicate:
    -   This check now works for any item that has `minecraft:damage` component
    -   An item that does not have a `minecraft:damage` component can never match
    -   To check for unbreakable items, query value of `minecraft:unbreakable` component
    -   Fields:
        -   `damage` - optional bounds for value of `minecraft:damage` component
        -   `durability` - optional bounds for durability (max damage minus value of `minecraft:damage`)
-   Predicates `minecraft:enchantments`, `minecraft:stored_enchantments`, `minecraft:potion_contents` and `minecraft:damage` require matching component to exist on item
    -   That means that, for example, matching for empty enchantment list will not pass on items without `minecraft:damage` component
    -   Note: some components, like `minecraft:enchantments` have default values, so they will always match

##### Example:

Before:

    "item": {
      "enchantments": [
        {
          "enchantment": "minecraft:silk_touch",
          "levels": {
            "min": 1
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    

After:

    "item": {
      "predicates": {
        "minecraft:enchantments": [
            {
              "enchantment": "minecraft:silk_touch",
              "levels": {
                "min": 1
              }
            }
          ]
      }
    }

    -   Woods Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Forest biome. This will be the dominant Wolf variant that you will be able to find in the Overworld, since the Forest biome is very common
    -   Ashen Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Snowy Taiga biome
    -   Black Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Old Growth Pine Taiga biome, in smaller packs of 2 to 4
    -   Chestnut Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Old Growth Spruce Taiga biome, in smaller packs of 2 to 4
    -   Rusty Wolf - A variant that spawns in a new location for wolves - the Sparse Jungle biome, in smaller packs of 2 to 4
    -   Spotted Wolf - A variant that spawns in a new location for wolves - the Savanna Plateau biome, in larger packs of 4 to 8
    -   Striped Wolf - A variant that spawns in a new location for wolves, the Wooded Badlands biome, in larger packs of 4 to 8
    -   Snowy Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Grove biome. A rare type, that always walks alone
-   Adjusted spawning conditions for Wolves, allowing them to spawn on Coarse Dirt and Podzol blocks

## Changes

-   Adjusted passive mobs spawning in Grove biome to only include Rabbits, Foxes and Wolves
-   Button tooltips will no longer appear when hovering outside the containing element

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 34

## Data Pack Version 34

-   Recipe results can now specify component data
-   Added new entity predicate field `slots`, for matching item slots
-   Added slot names for ranges, like `container.*`
-   Added `execute if|unless items` to check and count items
-   Banner Patterns are now data-driven
-   Changes to Item Stack Component formats
-   Player Head blocks now store a `custom_name` tag, which will be copied to and from the item form when broken or placed
-   The `SkullOwner` and `ExtraType` fields in Player Head blocks have been replaced with a `profile` field, with the same format as the item component
-   For now, the `count` field on Item Stacks is always stored again, even if `1`
    -   If the field is missing in data, will still fall back to `1`

### Recipes

-   Recipe types `crafting_shaped`, `crafting_shapeless`, `stonecutting` and `smithing_transform` now accept `components` for the `result` item stack
-   The `result` field for recipe types `smelting`, `blasting`, `smoking` and `campfire_cooking` is now an item stack format without a count, which means you'll need to specify an object with an `id` field
    -   This `result` now also accepts `components` data

### Predicates

#### `slots` entity sub-predicate

-   New entity field `slots` allows to check single or multiple slots on any entity
-   The field contains a map of slot names (same as ones used in `item` commands) to item predicate
-   For slot ranges, only one slot needs to match for whole entry to pass

Example:

    {
        "condition": "minecraft:entity_properties",
        "entity": "this",
        "predicate": {
            "slots": {
                "container.*": {
                    "items": "dirt"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    

### Slot names

-   Slot names (used in `item` commands and `slots` entity predicates) now include slot ranges
-   Unless specified, existing commands can still only work on single slots
-   New slot names:
    -   `container.*` - contains `container.0` to `container.53`
    -   `hotbar.*` - contains `hotbar.0` to `hotbar.8`
    -   `inventory.*` - contains `inventory.0` to `inventory.26`
    -   `enderchest.*` - contains `enderchest.0` to `enderchest.26`
    -   `villager.*` - contains `villager.0` to `villager.7`
    -   `horse.*` - contains `horse.0` to `horse.14`
    -   `weapon.*` - contains `weapon.mainhand` and `weapon.offhand`
    -   `armor.*` - contains `armor.head`, `armor.chest`, `armor.legs`, `armor.feed`, `armor.body`
    -   `player.cursor` - item held by player on screen
        -   Note: this information is not available in creative mode
    -   `player.crafting.0` - `player.crafting.3`, `player.crafting.*` - player's crafting slots
        -   Note: this includes only player's inventory crafting slots. Crafting table (or any other slots on other screens) are not included

#### `execute if|unless items`

-   `execute if|unless items <source> <slots> <item_predicate>` command can be used to count items
    -   `<source>` is the same as one used in `item` command, i.e.
        -   `block <x> <y> <z>`
        -   `entity <target>` (selector can return multiple entities)
    -   `<slots>` can accept single slot (like `container.0`) or a range (like `container.*`)
    -   `<item_predicate>` is the same as item predicate in `clear` command
-   If used alone, it will return total number of items in stacks that match predicates

### Banner Patterns

-   Banner Patterns will now be loaded into a dynamic registry from data packs (`data/<namespace>/banner_pattern/<id>`)
    -   These entries have two fields:
        -   `asset_id` (namespaced string) is used to resolve texture locations
            -   e.g. `custom:pattern` resolves to `assets/custom/textures/entity/banner/pattern.png`, `assets/custom/textures/entity/shield/pattern.png`
        -   `translation_key` (string) is a translation key prefix
            -   e.g. `block.minecraft.banner.custom.pattern` resolves to `block.minecraft.banner.custom.pattern.<dye color>`

### Item Stack Components

-   The `minecraft:profile` component no longer requires the `name` field to be present
-   Some additional Item Stack Components now support alternative, simple definitions:
    -   `minecraft:profile` can be defined as string player name (e.g. `profile="jeb_"`)
    -   `minecraft:dyed_color` can be defined as an integer rgb color (e.g. `dyed_color=16711680`)
    -   `minecraft:attribute_modifiers` can be defined as a direct list of modifiers (e.g. `attribute_modifiers=[{type:'generic.scale',uuid:[1,2,3,4],name:'Big!',amount:1.0,operation:'add_multiplied_base'}]`)
    -   `minecraft:potion_contents` can be defined as a single potion id (e.g. `potion_contents="invisibility"`)
    -   `minecraft:enchantments` and `minecraft:stored_enchantments` can be defined as an inline map of enchantment id to level (e.g. `enchantments={sharpness:1}`)
    -   These are only an alternative for defining the values, they will always be stored in their full formats
-   All container blocks now use the `minecraft:container` component when in item form, not just Shulker Boxes
-   The `minecraft:lodestone_target` component has been renamed to `minecraft:lodestone_tracker`
    -   The `pos` and `dimension` fields have been moved into a `target` object
    -   The `target` field is optional, and if not present, the compass will spin
-   The maximum number of lore and fireworks entries has been raised to 256

# Minecraft Snapshot 24w09a

Hello! Here is a slightly bigger than usual snapshot with a lot of technical changes, refreshed UI, another iteration of Wolf Armor, and tweaks to new features.

Since the initial release of the Wolf Armor, we have been working on improving it to increase its protection, usability and add customization. For protection there is a new approach to armor, which considers the player's need to quickly see the state of the armor without using UI elements, and the ability to act quickly to help their pet wolf if needed. Please try it out and let us know what you think over at the feedback site: [Let's talk about Wolf Armor!](https://aka.ms/wolfarmorfeedback)

## Experimental Features

### Bogged

-   The Bogged drops 2 mushrooms (either both red/brown or one of each) when sheared
-   Updated Bogged texture and model

### Wind Charge

-   Removed randomness from the radius of both Breeze- and player-shot Wind Charges

### Vault

-   Additional changes to the Vault texture to even further distinguish from Trial Spawners

## Changes

-   Changes to Wolf Armor
-   The game's UI has been updated with a fresher look
-   Ctrl+Picking a renamed block (such as a Chest) in Creative Mode will now give a renamed item

### Wolf Armor

-   The Wolf Armor will protect the wolf from most damage sources until the armor loses all durability and breaks
-   Wolf Armor shows signs of increased breakage as durability goes down
-   Players can repair the Wolf Armor with Armadillo Scutes while it is equipped on the Wolf
-   Wolf armor can be dyed in similar fashion to Leather Armor
-   The Wolf's owner can now repair Wolf Armor on a Wolf

### UI

The UI has been updated to sport a fresher look and to be more consistent when it comes to the layout of different UI elements, all while retaining the essence and feel of the old screens.

As always, we're eager to hear your thoughts and opinions on further improvements or changes. Let us know what you think over at the [dedicated feedback site](https://aka.ms/JavaUIFeedback).

-   The menu background dirt texture has been replaced by a darkened background
    -   The dirt texture has been moved to the build-in Programmer Art Resource Pack
    -   Outside the game, the menu Panorama is displayed across all screen
    -   In the game, the world will be visible across all screens
    -   Paired with the darkened background is a blur
        -   The strength of the blur can be configured in Accessibility Settings
        -   In-game screens such as containers and books are not affected by these changes
-   Screen elements such as titles and buttons are positioned more consistently across different screens
-   The Player and World Backups screens in Realms have been updated
-   Lists now have clearer borders at the top and bottom
-   After defeating the Ender Dragon and entering the End Portal, the End Poem and credits are now displayed with a background based on the animated End Portal effect

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 33
-   The Resource Pack version is now 28
-   `playsound` command can now be used without specifying the player (assuming `@s`) and without specifying the mixer (assuming `master`)
-   In single player, when errors occur during loading or saving of chunks a warning will be shown in a toast
-   Trying join a single player world with less than 64 MB free disk space will show a warning screen
    -   Additionally, a warning toast will be shown periodically while in game

## Data Pack Version 33

-   Added `minecraft:bypasses_wolf_armor` for damage sources that can not be absorbed by Wolf Armor
-   Loot table entry with id `loot_table` now also accepts inline loot tables
-   Unstructured NBT data attached to stacks of items (`tag` field) has been replaced with structured 'components'

### Loot Tables

Loot table entry `loot_table` (which returns all items from provided nested loot table) now has the following syntax:

-   `value` - can be either:
    -   namespaced id - reference to another named loot table
    -   full loot table (same format as in standalone file)

### Item Stack Components

We are making some large changes to how Item Stack-specific properties are stored and represented in this snapshot, replacing the current NBT 'tag' with structured components.

This change has been made in order to:

-   Improve performance in cases where the game needs to frequently look up some property of an item (e.g. Armor Trims rendering every frame)
-   Validate item properties at load time, enabling easier identification of invalid data in commands and data packs
    -   This should avoid any 'silent' breakages in commands specifying custom item data for any potential future format changes
-   Continue to evolve the game to enable the creation of dynamic content

We understand that this is a significant breaking change for many datapacks and custom maps which will require significant effort to upgrade.

We do however believe that this builds critical foundations for future extensibility. We have taken care to ship these changes all at once, with the hope that this avoids future incremental changes requiring many small updates to packs.

The current NBT 'tag' has existed for quite some time, and we are aware that a lot of clever techniques have been developed with this for commands and data packs.

Although we have made our best effort to identify these cases, some of these techniques rely on undocumented or undefined behavior with certain tag configurations.

We want to ensure that no functionality is lost without a suitable alternative, but due to the undocumented nature of these techniques, we have very likely not caught everything!

We hope to address any regressions over the remaining course of this snapshot cycle.

With such a large change, we deeply value your feedback! You can share your thoughts on these changes over at the feedback site: [Let's talk about Item Stack Components!](https://aka.ms/ItemStackComponentsFeedback).

-   Unstructured NBT data attached to stacks of items (`tag` field) has been replaced with structured 'components'
    -   This data is parsed and validated when the item is loaded
    -   This should improve performance in certain scenarios (e.g. Armor Trim rendering) when item data was frequently compared or requested and parsed
    -   Custom data can still be stored in the `minecraft:custom_data` component
-   Item types (e.g. `minecraft:stick`) hold a set of default components on an item that individual item stacks can override
-   The format of serialized items and items in data packs has been updated for consistency and to support components
-   Item syntax in commands has been updated to support components
-   When advanced tooltips are enabled (F3+H), the number of components will be displayed instead of number of tags
-   Default component values for items are now listed in `items.json` generated in `reports` directory
-   The `ignoreTags` field on villager trades has been removed and replaced by a component predicate on damage
-   Block definitions are now added to `blocks.json` report (note: those definitions are not used yet and present only for informational purposes)
-   If the `key_item` field of Vault block is not present, the Vault cannot be unlocked

### Commands

-   Commands such as `/give`, `/item`, `/loot`, and `/clear` have updated item syntax
-   Components can now be specified after the item name in square brackets
    -   Components are assigned with an `=` (e.g. `wooden_pickaxe[damage=23]`)
    -   Components are comma-separated (e.g. `netherite_hoe[damage=5,repair_cost=2]`)
-   Component types will be autocompleted, but values themselves will not
-   Values will however be validated, and the command will fail to parse if the component is improperly specified
    -   e.g. `/give @s wooden_pickaxe[damage=-34]` is not valid
-   The pre-existing NBT syntax (`{...}`) is rewired to set or match the `minecraft:custom_data` component
    -   e.g. `/give @s stick{foo:'bar'}` is equivalent to `/give @s stick[custom_data={foo:'bar'}]`
    -   If both `[...]` and `{...}` are specified, `[...]` must be ordered before `{...}`
-   Item predicate arguments (in `/clear`) have new semantics with respect to matching components and custom data
    -   Every specified component must be present on the target item, and have an exactly equal parsed value
    -   Components with defaults (e.g. `damage=0` by default) will be assumed to exist on the target item if not specified
        -   As such, `/clear @s diamond_pickaxe[damage=0]` will match only undamaged Diamond Pickaxes
        -   On the other hand, `/clear @s diamond_pickaxe` will match any Diamond Pickaxe, irrespective of damage
    -   Exact matching of component values applies even for the `minecraft:custom_data` component
    -   However, using the `{...}` custom data syntax will use pre-existing NBT partial match behaviour
        -   This requires that all tags specified in the predicate are present on the target item, but additional ones may be ignored
        -   Lists in the target must contain all items specified in the predicate, but additional may be present and order is ignored
-   Modifier operations in the `/attribute` command have been renamed:
    -   `add` -> `add_value`
    -   `multiply_base` -> `add_multiplied_base`
    -   `multiply` -> `add_multiplied_total`

### Item Stack Format

-   Along with format changes due to components, the structures of item stacks on disk and in data packs have been updated for consistency
-   Previous `id` (string) and `Count` (byte) fields have been replaced with `id` (namespaced string) and `count` (integer) fields
    -   This format is additionally applied to the `icon` field in advancements, items in chat component hover events, and the `result` field in smelting recipes (`result` and `count` are no longer inlined)
-   The `count` field is optional (defaults to `1`), and no longer stored if default
    -   Stack size is now limited to the maximum stack size of the item
-   The `tag` field has been removed, and any remaining contents will end up in the `minecraft:custom_data` component when upgrading
-   A new `components` field stores all components attached to an item
    -   Format: map of component id to component value (varies by component id)
        -   e.g. `{..., components: {'minecraft:damage': 12}}`
        -   Components with a `!` prefix (e.g. `"!minecraft:damage": {}`) will cause this component to be removed
    -   Components equal to their default value will not be stored
-   The item stack format no longer represents empty stacks (`air` item, or `count` 0)
    -   Instead, in places that support it, the field should be ommitted
    -   In some cases, such as lists of stacks (e.g. `HandItems` in living entities), an empty map (`{}`) is used to represent empty stacks

### Other Format Changes

-   Tipped Arrows no longer store their applied potion effects
    -   This is instead fetched from their held `item`
-   Area Effect Clouds now store potions in the same format as the `minecraft:potion_contents` component in a `potion_contents` field:
    -   `Potion` -> `potion_contents.potion`
    -   `Color` -> `potion_contents.custom_color`
    -   `effects` -> `potion_contents.custom_effects`
-   Banners now store applied patterns in the same format as the `minecraft:banner_patterns` component in a `patterns` field:
    -   `Patterns[].Pattern` (string short id) -> `patterns[].pattern` (string pattern registry id)
    -   `Patterns[].Color` (integer dye id) -> `patterns[].color` (string dye name)
-   Beehive format has also been updated:
    -   `Bees[].EntityData` -> `bees[].entity_data`
    -   `Bees[].TicksInHive` -> `bees[].ticks_in_hive`
    -   `Bees[].MinOccupationTicks` -> `bees[].min_ticks_in_hive`
    -   `FlowerPos` -> `flower_pos`
-   Villager Trades can be configured to accept only undamaged items by selecting for `'minecraft:damage': 0`
    -   By default, if no components are specified, any item will be accepted (similar to `components` field in item predicates)

### Loot Item Functions

-   Added `minecraft:set_components` function
    -   Adds or replaces the given component on the input item
    -   `conditions`: list of conditions (default: `[]`):
        -   Conditions to check before applying the function
    -   `components`: map of component id to component value (format varied by id)
        -   Components with a `!` prefix (e.g. `"!minecraft:damage": {}`) will cause this component to be removed
-   Added `minecraft:copy_components` function
    -   Copies components from a specified source onto an item
    -   This is now used in the Vanilla pack in place of the `minecraft:copy_name` and `minecraft:copy_nbt` functions
    -   `conditions`: list of conditions (default: `[]`):
        -   Conditions to check before applying the function

    -   These now apply to the `minecraft:custom_data` component of the target item
-   `minecraft:set_attributes` function has been updated
    -   The modifier `slot` field now supports `any`, `armor`, and `hand` values
    -   The modifier `operation` values have been renamed:
        -   `addition` -> `add_value`
        -   `multiply_base` -> `add_multiplied_base`
        -   `multiply_total` -> `add_multiplied_total`

### Predicate Formats in Loot Tables & Advancements

-   Item predicate format has been updated:
    -   `tag` field has been removed
    -   `items` field now supports a single entry, hash-prefixed item tag, or list of items
    -   `potion` -> `potions`, and supports a single entry, hash-prefixed potion tag, or list of potions
    -   `nbt` predicate has been renamed to `custom_data` and now matches `minecraft:custom_data` component

# Minecraft Snapshot 24w06a

Poof! Here's snapshot 24w06a with the new experimental Wind Charge item and optimizations for Hoppers... among other changes!

We'd love to get your feedback on the new Wind Charge feature over at the official feedback site: [Let's talk about Wind Charges!](https://aka.ms/mcwindchargefeedback)

We've also made a change so that a hopper will no longer try to pick up item entities if there is a full block placed above it. This will improve performance for many redstone builds, but will break some machines that relied on glitching items into a block above a hopper.

Happy parkouring!

## Experimental Features

### Wind Charge

-   Become the Breeze! Using a Wind Charge will fire off a wind charge projectile similar to the Breeze's
-   A Wind Charge fired by a player will grant 10% more knockback than a Breeze's, but have a much smaller area of impact
-   Just like the projectile fired by the Breeze, Wind Charges fired by the player also deal damage if they hit an entity directly
-   The Breeze drops between 4-6 Wind Charges when killed
-   There is a half-second cooldown after each use
-   Wind Charges can be fired from a dispenser
-   Players that launch themselves with a wind charge only accumulate fall damage below the y-level of where they collided with the wind burst

### Vault

-   Tweaked the texture of Vaults to make them easier to distinguish from Trial Spawners

## Changes

-   Final tweaks to Armadillo
-   Updates to Tamed Wolves health and damage
-   Added option to use Japanese variants of CJK characters
-   Hoppers will no longer try to pick up item entities if there is a full block placed above it

### Armadillo

-   Armadillos do not panic when damaged but roll up instead, and hide their head and feet
-   Armadillos peek out to see if “the coast is clear” before unrolling
-   New animations and sounds for rolling up and unrolling + the peek out animation

With these changes the Armadillo work is done for now, and we are switching our attention to the Wolf Armor instead.

### Tamed Wolves health and damage

-   Tamed Wolves now have 40 health points (20 hearts) instead of 20 health points (10 hearts)
-   They no longer take half of the damage from most environmental sources like they used to do
    -   In most cases this change will make no difference given the health boost, but now they can withstand more damage from players and arrows
-   Feeding a Wolf now heals twice as many health points

### Japanese font variants

-   New option has been added to select Japanese variants for some CJK characters
-   Replacement glyphs come from Japanese version of Unifont font
-   New option is included in new "Font Settings" menu, accessible from "Language" menu
-   Default value of this option is based on system locale language setting
-   "Force Unicode" button has been moved to "Font Settings"

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 31
-   The Resource Pack version is now 26
-   Improved hopper performance
-   Added JFR (Java Flight Recorder) events for individual chunk reads (`minecraft.ChunkRegionRead`) and writes (`minecraft.ChunkRegionWrite`)
-   Maximum length of a command in a function (including macro expansions) can no longer exceed 2,000,000 characters
-   Reduced amount of data sent by the server during login by reusing parts of the vanilla datapack

## Data Pack Version 31

-   Potion effect amplifiers are restricted between 0 and 255 again
    -   The former behavior of effects such as Jump Boost, Levitation, and Mining Fatigue over 127 has been replaced with new attributes
-   Added `generic.gravity` attribute that controls blocks/tick^2 acceleration downward
-   Added `generic.safe_fall_distance` attribute to control the fall distance after which the entity will take fall damage
-   Added `generic.fall_damage_multiplier` attribute to multiply overall fall damage amount
-   Renamed `horse.jump_strength` to `generic.jump_strength`, and now applies to all entities
    -   This controls the base impulse from a jump (before jump boost or modifier on block)
-   Added `player.block_break_speed` attribute that acts as a multiplier over block breaking speed for players
-   All block positions are now stored as an array of 3 integers instead of a map of `X`, `Y`, and `Z`
-   `FlowerPos` and `HivePos` in Bees have been renamed to `flower_pos` and `hive_pos`
-   `FlowerPos` in Beehives has been renamed to `flower_pos`
-   `BeamTarget` in End Crystals has been renamed to `beam_target`
-   `Leash` in all leashable entities has been renamed to `leash`
-   `PatrolTarget` in patrolling mobs has been renamed to `patrol_target`
-   `ExitPortal` in End Gateways has been renamed to `exit_portal`
-   `WanderTarget` in Wandering Traders has been renamed to `wander_target`

### Tags

#### Block Tags:

-   Added 'minecraft:blocks\_wind\_charge\_explosions' for blocks not impacted by the explosion when hit by Wind Charge.

## Resource Pack Version 26

-   Added font variant filters to font providers

### Font variant filters

-   Every glyph provider can now be enabled or disabled based on certain set of variants
-   Available variants are currently hardcoded and controlled by font options menu
    -   Current variants:
        -   `uniform` - wired to "Force Uniform" button
        -   `jp` - wired to "Japanese Glyph Variants" button
-   Filters are defined in section called `filter`, available for every glyph provider
    -   Keys in that object are variant names (for example `uniform`)
    -   Glyph provider will be included only when value in filter matches actual value of variant in key

# Minecraft Snapshot 24w05a

Hi everyone! We're back with yet another snapshot for 1.20.5, which includes a collection of technical changes, bug fixes and a new experimental feature for Trial Chambers, the Vault Block!

We're very interested in hearing your feedback on this new feature over at the feedback site: [Let's talk about Vaults!](https://aka.ms/mcvaultsfeedback)

Happy looting!

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 30
-   The Resource Pack version is now 25
-   Added a reserved region file compression id for third-party servers to use for custom compression implementations
-   Added an option to not compress region files
-   Allowed server operators to view dedicated server TPS debug chart

### Region file compression algorithm

-   Added a third value to the dedicated server configuration property `region-file-compression`:
    -   `none` does not compress the data. Consumes significantly more space and requires significant time to read and write, even though CPU is used less. Might make sense together with filesystem level compression

### Reserved compression id for third-party servers

-   Compression id `127` can now be used for custom implementations of region file compression
-   When used, the version id must be followed by a namespaced string representing the custom algorithm used

## Data Pack Version 30

-   Potion effects stored in items or entities will no longer encode their default values
    -   `amplifier`: `0`
    -   `duration`: `0`
    -   `ambient`: `false`
    -   `show_particles`: `true`
-   Added `body_armor_item` and `body_armor_drop_chance` to all entities that currently have `HandItems` and `ArmorItems`, and handle the same way as `HandItems` and `ArmorItems`
-   Handling of Horses `ArmorItem`, Llamas `DecorItem`, and Wolf's `armor` has been changed to use `body_armod_item` and `body_armor_drop_chance` instead
-   In commands, removed `horse.armor` slot argument, and added instead `armor.body` slot argument, applicable now to all mobs
-   Added `vault_connection` particle
-   Added Vault block with a variety of NBT elements which can be configured for custom content
    -   `config`
        -   `loot_table` The loot table that will be ejected upon being unlocked
            -   Default value: `"minecraft:chests/trial_chambers/reward"`
        -   `activation_range` The range any player who hasn't unlocked the Vault must be within for it to open its keyhole
            -   Default value: `4`
        -   `deactivation_range` The range all viable players must be outside of for the Vault to close its keyhole
            -   Default value: `4.5`
        -   `key_item` An itemstack that is required to unlock the Vault
            -   NBT and stack count is used for comparison
            -   Default value: `"minecraft:trial_key"`
        -   `override_loot_table_to_display` An optional loot table which will be used for displaying items inside the cage instead of results from the config's `loot_table`
            -   Default value: No value
    -   `shared_data`
        -   `connected_particles_range` The range players who have not unlocked the Vault must be within before particles will flow from them
            -   Default value: `4.5`

## Resource Pack Version 25

-   The unused attributes array in core shader definitions has been removed
-   The unused `position_color_normal` and `position_tex_lightmap_color` shaders have been removed
-   The `position_tex_color_normal` shader (only used by clouds) has been replaced by `rendertype_clouds`
-   The `IViewRotMat` uniform has been removed, and the `Position` attribute for entities is now in (camera relative) world space
-   Light direction uniforms are no longer premultiplied by the view matrix
-   Added texture and model files for Vault block
-   Changed texture for the Trial Key item
-   Added texture and particle file for `vault_connection` particle

## Experimental Features

-   Added Vault block

### Vault

-   A block that holds locked treasure and loot - find the right key to eject its rewards
    -   Found throughout Trial Chambers, containing the structures' most valuable loot
    -   Vaults in Trial Chambers require a Trial Key to be unlocked
-   Can be unlocked by an unlimited amount of players
    -   After a player has unlocked a Vault, they cannot unlock that Vault again
    -   If a player has not unlocked that Vault before, an orange stream of particles will flow from the player to the Vault when nearby
-   Has a keyhole that will be open or closed depending on the players nearby
    -   If any nearby player has not unlocked that Vault, the keyhole will be open
    -   If all nearby players have unlocked that Vault, the keyhole will be closed
-   Within its cage, it will cycle through and display items which are possible to eject from its loot table
-   The rewards it ejects are randomized from its loot table each time it is unlocked
-   Cannot be crafted or obtained in Survival, and does not drop anything when mined
-   Explosion-resistant and cannot be moved
-   Vaults currently reuse the same loot table that reward chests previously used in the Trial Chambers
    -   This loot table is temporary and will be completely revised as development continues

### Trial Key

-   Updated texture to reflect new Vault visuals

## Fixed bugs in Snapshot 24w05a

-   [MC-225170](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-225170) Normal matrix scaling broken in some situations
-   [MC-260099](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-260099) Sniffer's snout shading changes during sniffing
-   [MC-264821](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-264821) The fog on armor worn by entities occurs too early
-   [MC-267922](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-267922) Wolf armor loses custom display name and other NBT when equipped

# Minecraft Snapshot 24w04a

Hello again! Here is another snapshot bringing you some Armadillo changes, experimental feature changes, and a bunch of technical changes. We have some server-side performance improvements and improved debug tools along with a new `transfer` command. Enjoy!

## Changes

-   Armadillo now also rolls up when it detects a mob, or a player that has attacked it recently
-   When an Armadillo is in rolled up state, its shell will protect it, and reduce the damage dealt to it, even allowing it to fully resist weak attacks
-   Renamed "Allow cheats" to "Allow commands"

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 29
-   Added an option to use a faster region file compression algorithm on dedicated servers
-   Introduced changes to optimizing worlds
-   Improved server TPS debug chart
-   Reduced time needed to generate explorer maps to buried treasures

### Region file compression algorithm

-   Added a dedicated server configuration property `region-file-compression` with 2 possible values:
    -   `deflate`, the default option. Uses the old algorithm
    -   `lz4` uses LZ4 algorithm, which requires less CPU time to compress and decompress but uses more disk space
-   Changing the compression algorithm will not automatically recompress the world
    -   New or updated chunks will use the newly configured algorithm, but the old ones will stay in the previous format

### World optimizing changes

-   Optimizing singleplayer worlds and running dedicated server with `forceUpgrade` now also upgrades contents of `entities` and `poi` directories of the world
-   New `recreateRegionFiles` dedicated server startup parameter
    -   It will trigger world optimization similar to `forceUpgrade`, but will also rewrite all the chunks independently of whether they have been upgraded
    -   This will create fresh and defragmented region files
    -   Using this parameter after changing the `region-file-compression` server property will recompress all region files in the new format

### Improved the server TPS debug chart

-   As before, it is accessible by pressing `F3 + 2` in a Singleplayer world
-   The bottom dark red section of the chart displays the time spent during the main logic of the server tick. It is equivalent to the value diplayed in the old chart
-   The light brown section displays time spent on running scheduled tasks
-   The purple section displays time spent executing all other code during the tick
-   The top light green (or yellow or red depending on lag) section displays time spent idling, waiting for next tick
-   The `min`, `avg`, `max` aggregate values are based on the sum of the first 3 sections

## Data Pack Version 29

-   Added the `transfer` command

### `transfer` Command

New command that triggers a transfer of a player to another server. Only exists on dedicated servers.

Syntax:

`transfer <hostname> [<port>] [<players>]`

Parameters:

-   `hostname`: String describing the hostname of the server to connect to
-   `port`: Integer denoting the port number of the server to connect to - if omitted, 25565 is used
-   `players`: The players to transfer - if omitted, `@s` is used

## Experimental Features

### Breeze

-   Breeze is now aggressive toward Iron Golems in addition to players
-   Breeze no longer retaliates against attacks from the following mobs: Skeletons, Strays, Zombies, Husks, Spiders, Cave Spiders, Slimes
-   The above mobs will not retaliate when hurt by the Breeze's Wind Charge Projectile

### Copper Grates

-   Stonecutting Copper Blocks into Copper Grates outputs 4 Copper Grates

# Minecraft Snapshot 24w03a

New year, new Snapshot - we're now releasing the third Snapshot of Minecraft 1.20.5. This time around, we're bringing some updates to the Armadillo, the Breeze, as well as accessibility improvements.

In addition to a big bundle of bug fixes, we're bringing some changes to how spawn chunks are handled.

The spawn chunks are an area of the Overworld located at the world spawn which are always loaded in memory. These are useful for some players but use more of your computer’s resources and make the game load and run more slowly. (You can read more about spawn chunks at the [community wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Spawn_chunk)!)

In this snapshot we made the size of the spawn chunks configurable by adding a new gamerule: `spawnChunkRadius`. The new default setting is 2 (which creates a 48x48 block area). This is 98% smaller than the previous area and will result in a noticeable performance improvement for most players.

If you would like to keep your spawn chunks working like they did before, you can use the game rule to change the spawn chunk radius value to 10. This will make your spawn chunks work the same as they did before, but you will miss out on the performance gains.

We're interested in hearing your feedback on this change and how the new default setting affects you.

[Let's talk about spawn chunks!](https://aka.ms/spawnchunksfeedback)

## New Features

### Armadillo

Armadillo visual update! We gathered feedback from the first Armadillo snapshot, and the next step in the look of the Armadillo, the Armadillo Scutes and the Wolf Armor are now here.

-   Armadillos now also spawn in Badlands

#### Armadillo Rolling Up Behavior

-   Spiders and Cave Spiders will run away from Armadillos not in a rolled up state

## Changes

-   Adjusted the texture of the Wolf Collar layer to be more consistent with the new Wolf Armor

### Accessibility

-   The default focus is now always set when entering or exiting any menu while navigating using tab or arrow keys

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 28
-   The Resource Pack version is now 24
-   Custom Villager trades can be configured to accept items that have different tags from the expected item by adding `ignoreTags: true` in the trade's NBT
-   When entities leave or enter the end the area they arrive in will now stay loaded for 15 seconds, matching the behavior of nether portals
-   Added transfer packets
-   Added cookie packets
-   Decreased the default size of the spawn chunks and made the value configurable

### Transfer Packets

-   Custom servers can now request that clients connect to another server with a new packet
-   When a client is transferred it will connect to the target server with a new transfer intent (id 3)
-   By default servers will not accept incoming transfers and will disconnect the client
-   This can be changed by setting the `accepts-transfers` property to `true` in the `server.properties` file
-   Resource packs are maintained across transfers
-   In the case of a transfer custom servers can skip authentication with a new flag

### Cookie Packets

-   Cookie packets allow custom servers to request and store data on a client
    -   Each cookie may be up to 5 KiB in size
    -   Cookies may be requested during login, configuration and play phases — but only stored during the configuration and play phases
-   Cookies are persisted across server transfers but are not persisted when the player disconnects
    -   This allows servers to pass along information such as authentication or custom game data to the new server

### Spawn Chunk Changes

-   The size of the spawn chunks changed from radius 10 (19x19 entity ticking chunks) to radius 2 (3x3 entity ticking chunks)
    -   This was done to reduce memory usage, loading times and CPU usage
    -   We opted to not fully remove spawn chunks to allow players who currently utilize this functionality to continue to do so
-   Added a new gamerule `spawnChunkRadius` to set the size of the spawn chunks
    -   Possible values are 0 to 32, where 0 completely disables the spawn chunks and 10 is equivalent to the functionality before this change
    -   Default value is 2, equivalent to 3x3 entity ticking chunks

## Data Pack Version 28

-   The `minecraft:sweeping` enchantment has been renamed to `minecraft:sweeping_edge`
-   Added Advancement Criteria trigger `default_block_use` which triggers due to the default interaction of a block by a player, such as opening a door
-   Added Advancement Criteria trigger `any_block_use` which triggers due to any type of interaction with a block by a player, such as using an item on the block or its default usage

### Tags

#### Item Tags

New item tags controlling what enchantments can be added to what gear:

-   `minecraft:enchantable/foot_armor`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/leg_armor`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/chest_armor`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/head_armor`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/armor`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/weapon`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/sword`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/mining`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/mining_loot`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/fishing`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/trident`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/durability`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/bow`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/equippable`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/crossbow`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/vanishing`

#### Entity Type Tags:

-   Added `minecraft:ignores_poison_and_regen` for entities that cannot be affected by Poison and Regeneration effects
-   Added `minecraft:illager_friends` for entities that Illagers will consider allies (unless on a different team)
-   Added `minecraft:inverted_healing_and_harm` for entities that have inverted meanings of the Healing and Harm effects
-   Added `minecraft:not_scary_for_pufferfish` for entities that will not cause Pufferfish to puff
-   Added `minecraft:sensitive_to_bane_of_arthropods` for entities sensitive to Bane of Arthropods
-   Added `minecraft:sensitive_to_impaling` for entities sensitive to Impaling
-   Added `minecraft:wither_friends` for entities that the Wither will not target and which cannot harm the Wither

## Resource Pack 24

-   The `ttf` font provider transforms have been adjusted to have more reasonable defaults
    -   `shift` is no longer applied double, and now directly represents a number of pixels in the game UI
    -   The font EM square is fitted to `size` pixels in the game UI, instead of between the font ascender and font descender
    -   The font baseline is positioned consistently with the default font (7 pixels below line top)
    -   This means that generally, any font with a `size` of 9 and no `shift` should look correct by default

## Experimental Features

### Breeze

-   Breeze now deflects all projectiles
-   Deflected projectiles now deflect in the direction of the shooter

### Trade Rebalance

-   In the Trade Rebalance Experiment, Villagers who buy armor now ignore durability and can buy damaged armor

---

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w51a

We're now releasing Snapshot 23w51a, the first snapshot for Minecraft 1.20.5. This one comes with a present for your pet Wolf in time for the holidays - and the Armadillo.

Happy brushing!

## New Features

-   Added Armadillo, Armadillo Scutes and Wolf Armor

### Armadillo

-   The Armadillo is a new passive mob that:
    -   drops Armadillo Scutes periodically
    -   drops Armadillo Scutes when brushed
    -   spawns in Savannas
    -   its favorite food is Spider Eye

#### Armadillo Rolling Up Behavior

-   Armadillo rolls up when it detects a threat such as:
    -   a sprinting player
    -   a player in a vehicle or mounted
    -   undead mobs
-   It does not roll up when:
    -   it is fleeing
    -   in water
    -   in the air or
    -   on a leash
-   When an Armadillo is rolled up it does not walk, cannot eat, and will not be tempted by food
    -   It will continue to scan for threats: if none are detected for 3 seconds, it will unroll

#### Armadillo Scutes

-   Armadillo Scutes can be used to craft Wolf Armor
-   They are dropped by Armadillos
-   Dispensers can be used to brush Armadillo Scutes off Armadillos

### Wolf Armor

-   Using Wolf Armor on an adult tamed Wolf will equip the armor on the wolf.
-   Only a Wolf's owner can put a Wolf Armor on their tamed Wolf, and with this in mind; Dispensers cannot put Wolf Armor on wolves.
-   Wolf Armor gives the same protection as Diamond Horse Armor.
-   Using Shears on a Wolf that is wearing armor will make it drop the armor
-   Only a Wolf's owner can shear a Wolf Armor from it, and with this in mind; Dispensers cannot remove Wolf Armor from wolves.
-   If a Wolf dies while wearing armor, it will drop the armor.

## Changes

-   Renamed scutes that come from Turtles to Turtle Scutes
-   Llamas and Shulkers are no longer able to destroy armor stands

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 27

## Data Pack 27

-   Llamas now use a new damage type `spit` instead of `mob_projectile`
-   `FactorCalculationData` has been removed from mob effect instance tags
-   Added `generic.scale` attribute that can be used to rescale any living entity
-   Player reach distance can now be controlled with the `generic.block_interaction_range` and `generic.entity_interaction_range` attributes
-   The maximum number of blocks that an entity can step up without jumping is now controlled by the `generic.step_height` attribute

## Experimental Features

### Breeze

-   Added a new 'whirl' idle sound
-   Added a 'charging up attack' sound
-   Added a sound that plays while the Breeze is in the air
-   Added a projectile deflection sound
-   Tweaked existing sounds

### Trial Spawner

-   The Trial Spawner now has the same two default loot tables as they have in the Trial Chamber

# Minecraft 1.20.3 Pre-Release 1

We're bringing you the first Pre-Release of 1.20.3 with updates to server resource pack handling and bug fixes!

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 26
-   The Resource Pack version is now 22
-   Changes to downloaded/world resource pack handling

### World resource packs

Changes apply to world resource packs (`resources.zip`), Realms resource packs and resource packs controlled by dedicated servers.

#### UI

-   Download screen has been replaced with a toast
-   World resource pack application will start together with chunk loading

#### Local storage

Downloaded packs are now stored in `downloads` directory (with different file organization than old `server-resource-packs`)

-   Files in this directory are no longer automatically cleaned (previously only up 10 packs were kept)
-   Additionally, inside this directory there is also log file `log.json` that stores information about downloaded files for debug purposes

#### Server config

Downloaded packs now have unique id (GUID/UUID) that can be used to differentiate them

-   This value for dedicated server pack can be configured with `resource-pack-id` option in `server.properties`
-   If the value is missing, it will be generated based on URL
-   If hash of a pack is not set, this pack will be redownloaded before every application
    -   Previously, if hash was missing, latest downloaded version of pack was applied

#### Packets

Some additional options are added for 3rd-party servers software:

-   Client can now accept multiple server resource packs
-   New packet was added to un-apply server resource packs
-   Resource packs are no longer cleaned when entering configuration phase

## Data Pack Version 26

-   Renamed `minecraft:grass` block and item to `minecraft:short_grass`

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w46a

This snapshot brings about a few redstone-focused changes. Notably, we’re tweaking the tick delay behavior of the crafter and the copper bulb while they’re still in experimental development.

With these changes, we aim to make the crafter more consistent with other blocks that drop or eject items, and the copper bulb with other blocks that react or change state when a connected redstone signal changes. As a result of this, some contraptions built during the last few snapshots may no longer work properly.

We're really excited about the tinkering opportunities both these new redstone blocks bring to the world. Please keep sending all your thoughts about them to Minecraft Feedback so we can keep building Minecraft together!

Enjoy!

## Changes

-   Updated Crafter textures

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 25

## Data Pack Version 25

-   Added individual display names for scoreboard entries

### Commands

#### `scoreboard`

##### Display names

-   Each entry in a scoreboard can now have a custom display name
-   Those values are kept separate per objective and score holder
-   If the name is not present, the score holder name is used (i.e. the old behavior)
-   If the score is reset or the whole objective is removed, the name is not preserved
-   Team decorations will still be applied to names as normal
-   Subcommands for managing names:
    -   `scoreboard players display name <targets> <objective> <text component>` - set display name
    -   `scoreboard players display name <targets> <objective>` - clear display name

##### Display name auto-update

-   To make display name management easier, objectives can also be configured to auto-update display names on every score update
-   This option is disabled by default
-   If a score holder has no display name (because it can't be attributed to any currently loaded entity), the current name is preserved
-   Command to control auto-update for objective:
    -   `scoreboard objectives modify <scoreboard> displayautoupdate [true|false]`

##### Number formatting

-   Scores in numeric form can now be formatted
-   Formats can be set for both objectives and individual scores
-   Scores with set formats will render the same in all context (sidebar, under player name, etc.)
-   Subcommands for managing formats:
    -   `scoreboard objectives modify <objective> numberformat <format>` - for setting default format for an objective
    -   `scoreboard objectives modify <objective> numberformat` - for clearing default format for an objective
    -   `scoreboard players display numberformat <targets> <score> <format>` - for setting format for a specific score holder
    -   `scoreboard players display numberformat <targets> <score>` - for clearing format for a specific score holder

Formats:

-   `styled <style>` - score will be displayed with selected style (like `{"bold":true}`)
-   `fixed <text component>` - score will be replaced with text
-   `blank` - score will not be displayed

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w45a

We're happy to share another snapshot, this time offering an early look at some exciting new adventures waiting for you underground in the form of Trial Chambers!

Trial Chambers are designed to be challenging moments of combat and exploration hidden medium-deep below the surface of the Overworld. Trial Chambers bring new decorative and lighting blocks, new Trial Spawners to deliver a different style of multi-mob fights, and the bushy-browed Breeze, a new mob specific to Trial Chambers which will add quite a bit of chaos to your combats.

Happy Mining!

## Changes

-   Monster Spawner now renders their inner faces when looking inside

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 24
-   The Resource Pack version is now 21

## Data Pack Version 24

-   Added experimental Breeze mob
-   Added experimental Trial Spawner block
-   Increased maximum value of Jigsaw structure variable `size` from 7 to 20
-   Added `trial_chambers_copper_bulb_degradation` structure processor list

## Resource Pack Version 21

-   `uniform` font has been updated to use Unifont 15.1.04 (from 15.0.06)
-   The only supported texture format is now .png

### Breeze Mob

-   Added entity models and textures for experimental Breeze mob:
    -   `breeze`, `wind_charge`
-   Added shader:
    -   `breeze_wind`

## Experimental Features

### Added Breeze mob

-   The Breeze is a cunning, hostile mob that can spawn via Trial Spawner in some rooms within the Trial Chambers
-   The Breeze moves primarily by leaping around the target, sometimes jumping quite long distances
-   An aggressive adversary, the Breeze shoots volatile wind energy in the form of wind charge projectiles at its target
-   Wind charges deal a small amount of damage when colliding directly with an entity
-   After colliding with an entity or a block, wind charge projectiles produce a wind burst, which knocks back entities in the area by several blocks
-   Wind bursts also have the effect of 'activating' certain blocks:
    -   Non-Iron Doors and Trapdoors are flipped
    -   Fence Gates are flipped
    -   Buttons are pressed
    -   Levers are flipped
    -   Bells are rung and swung
    -   Lit Candles (both standalone and on cake) are extinguished
-   Wind bursts do not have any effect on Iron Doors, Iron Trapdoors, or any block being held in its position by a Redstone signal

### Trial Spawner

-   Trial Spawner is a new variant of Monster Spawners that ejects rewards upon completion and can have variable levels of challenge in multiplayer
-   The challenge level will increase for each new player a Trial Spawner notices nearby
    -   Challenge level will not decrease until it is reset during a Trial Spawner's cooldown
-   Unlike normal spawners, a Trial Spawner will spawn a limited number of mobs proportional to its current challenge level
    -   It can only spawn a mob at positions that are within line of sight
    -   It can spawn a mob regardless of any light level requirement the mob has
    -   Spawned mobs are persistent
-   Once all mobs are defeated, the Trial Spawner will eject a set of rewards proportional to the current challenge level
    -   After the rewards have been ejected, the Trial Spawner goes into cooldown for 30 minutes during which it will no longer spawn mobs
-   Trial Spawners cannot be crafted nor obtained by players in Survival - instead, they can be found naturally placed throughout Trial Chambers
-   Trial Spawners are extremely slow to mine and resistant to explosions, and will not drop even with Silk Touch
-   When placed in Creative, Trial Spawners have no mob type set by default
    -   The mob type can be set by interacting with it while holding a Spawn Egg
-   Creative and Spectator players cannot be detected or noticed by Trial Spawners

### Trial Chambers

-   Trial Chambers are a new structure in the Overworld where players can explore and take on combat challenges during the mid-game
    -   Trial Chambers are made out of a variety of Copper and Tuff blocks and can be found in different sizes from large to small
    -   Trial Chambers are a relatively common find throughout the Deepslate layer of the underground
-   The layout of each Trial Chamber is procedurally generated, and can include traps, reward chests and a variety of combat spaces
    -   Supply chests can be found between different rooms, and give you blocks and items which help you navigate your trials
    -   Reward chests are guarded by challenges in each room, and can be a source of many high level enchanted books and equipment
    -   The loot found in reward chests are still being iterated, and are absolutely not final
-   Each Trial Chamber will include Trial Spawners with a melee, small melee, or ranged category:
    -   Melee
        -   Zombie
        -   Husk
        -   Slime
    -   Small Melee
        -   Spider
        -   Cave Spider
        -   Baby Zombie
        -   Silverfish
    -   Ranged
        -   Skeleton
        -   Stray
        -   Skeleton with Poison Tipped Arrows
-   Each Trial Spawner category will only use one mob for the entire structure when generated, and these mobs are randomized for each Trial Chamber
    -   For example, one Trial Chamber might only spawn Zombies, Cave Spiders and Strays, while another might only spawn Slimes, Silverfish and Skeletons
    -   The exceptions to this are some Trial Spawners in unique rooms which always spawn Breezes

#### Known issues

-   The corridors sometimes end with a dead end
-   Aquifers, Lush Caves, and Sculk Veins sometimes intersect with the Trial Chamber

### Trial Key

-   An item that can only be obtained from Trial Spawners
-   Trial Keys do not currently have any functionality

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w44a

In this week's Snapshot we're taking a break from new features to improve ones we've already added, including fixes to Commands and the ability to use Loot Tables with Decorated Pots.

## Changes

-   Copper Doors & Copper Trapdoors has updated textures

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 23

## Data Pack Version 23

-   Decorated Pots can now utilize loot tables and will read from the `LootTable` tag key
-   Additional changes to command functions

### Commands

#### `tick`

-   The `<time>` parameter in the `tick step` command is now optional. The default value is 1

#### `return`

-   `return run` will now always return
    -   If there are no valid results from returned command, function containing `return run` will fail (i.e. `success=0` and `result=0`)
-   `return run` will now propagate success value together with results value (previously it always set success to `1`)
-   `return run` now also allows storing values - that means `execute store ... run return run some_command` will both store value and return it outside function
-   New subcommand `return fail` is added to make whole function fail (i.e. return `success=0` and `result=0`)

#### `function`

-   If `function <function tag>` runs multiple functions in combination with `return run`, execution will stop after first `return` in any of the functions
-   A single call to the `function` command will always have return when run with `return run`
    -   For example, `return run execute [split context] run function <some function with conditional return>` will always return after processing the first context

#### `execute if|unless function`

-   `execute if|unless function` will no longer always fail if all functions had no return
    -   If there were no `returns` in called functions, `if` will fail and `unless` will pass
    -   First `return` in any of called functions will return (for a single context)

## Changes

-   The Bat now has a new look
-   Thrown Ender Pearls produce a teleportation sound on impact
-   Small tweaks to the Telemetry Data Collection screen

### Bat

-   The Bat has an updated model, animations and texture

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 22
-   The Resource Pack version is now 20

## Data Pack Version 22

-   Added `tick` command
-   Added two new input fields for Selection Priority and Placement Priority in the Jigsaw block edit screen
-   Added `item` to `minecraft:arrow` and `minecraft:spectral_arrow`, this is the item that will be picked up
-   Renamed `Trident` to `item` in `minecraft:trident`

### `tick` command

Added a new `tick` command. This is an adminstative and debugging command that allows to control the ticking flow and measure the performance of the game. The command requires elevated permissions (admins and above) and so it is not by default available in command blocks and datapacks.

Syntax:

`tick query` - outputs the current target ticking rate, with information about the tick times performance.

`tick rate <rate>` - sets a custom target ticking rate to the specified value. The value must be greater than 1.0 and lower than 10000.0. Setting a very low tick rate can cause the game to feel unresponsive and setting too high tick rate for your system can cause the game to crash as the game now assumes, it is constantly falling behind the ticking target. Please use `tick query` or `<F3> + 2` (Integrated server only) debug screen to measure the performance of the game and adjust the tick rate accordingly. Setting a tick target lower than the default `20.0` will also cause the players to be simulated at a lower rate (including player movement and input controls), while setting a higher tick rate will cause the players to be simulated at the default rate of `20` ticks per second to maintain the expected responsiveness of the game, but can cause artifacts in entities interpolation.

`tick freeze` - freezes all gameplay elements, except for players and any entity a player is riding. This is useful for debugging and isolating issues with the game allowing the player to move around freely and inspect the world.

`tick step <time>` - Only works when the game is frozen. It runs the game for the specified number of ticks and then freezes the game again. This allows to step through the game a set amount of ticks at a time.

`tick step stop` - stops the current stepping process, and re-freezes the game.

`tick unfreeze` - unfreezes the game and resumes all gameplay elements.

`tick sprint <time>` - runs the game while ignoring the set ticking target rate (meaning that the game will run as fast as possible) for the specified number of ticks. At the end of the sprint, the game will resume the previous ticking target and display performance information about the tick times while sprinting. This is especially useful for testing gameplay elements that are time dependent, such as redstone contraptions, or mob behaviour in isolated environments that allow for much faster simulation.

`tick sprint stop` - stops the current tick sprint, and resumes the previous ticking target.

### Jigsaw Selection & Placement Priority

-   Selection Priority
    -   When the parent piece is being processed for connections, this controls the order in which this Jigsaw block attempts to connect to its target piece
    -   Jigsaws will be processed in descending priority order and randomly within the same priority
-   Placement Priority
    -   When this Jigsaw block connects to a piece, this is the order in which that piece is processed for connections in the wider structure
    -   Pieces will be processed in descending priority order with the default insertion order breaking ties within the same priority
-   This functionality has been added to support the ability for Jigsaw structures to generate branches in a depth-first order, as well as give finer control over ordering of connections
-   All existing Jigsaw blocks will default their Selection and Placement Priority to 0, resulting in the same behaviour as before these two configurable values were introduced

## Resource Pack Version 20

-   `bat.png` has been updated for the new Bat model
-   Added block models, items models and block state definitions for the following blocks:
    -   `chiseled_copper`, `exposed_chiseled_copper`, `weathered_chiseled_copper`, `oxidized_chiseled_copper`
    -   `copper_grate`, `expxosed_copper_grate`, `weathered_copper_grate`, `oxidized_copper_grate`
    -   `copper_bulb`, `exposed_copper_bulb`, `weathered_copper_bulb`, `oxidized_copper_bulb`
    -   `copper_door`, `exposed_copper_door`, `weathered_copper_door`, `oxidized_copper_door`
    -   `copper_trapdoor`, `exposed_copper_trapdoor`, `weathered_copper_trapdoor`, `oxidized_copper_trapdoor`
    -   `tuff_stairs`
    -   `tuff_slab`
    -   `tuff_wall`
    -   `chiseled_tuff`
    -   `polished_tuff`
    -   `polished_tuff_stairs`
    -   `polished_tuff_slab`
    -   `polished_tuff_wall`
    -   `tuff_bricks`
    -   `tuff_brick_stairs`
    -   `tuff_brick_slab`
    -   `tuff_brick_wall`
    -   `chiseled_tuff_bricks`
-   Added unique sprites for the following blocks:
    -   `chiseled_copper`, `exposed_chiseled_copper`, `weathered_chiseled_copper`, `oxidized_chiseled_copper`
    -   `copper_grate`, `expxosed_copper_grate`, `weathered_copper_grate`, `oxidized_copper_grate`
    -   `copper_bulb`, `exposed_copper_bulb`, `weathered_copper_bulb`, `oxidized_copper_bulb`
    -   `copper_door`, `exposed_copper_door`, `weathered_copper_door`, `oxidized_copper_door`

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w42a

Hey! Today we bring you the first of the features we've shown you during Minecraft Live last weekend: the Crafter!

## Experimental Features

### Crafter

-   The Crafter is a new block that enables the crafting of items and blocks via Redstone
-   The Crafter will eject one crafted item at a time when powered by a new Redstone signal / pulse (not a continuous signal)
-   Upon receiving this new signal, the Crafter will eject the recipe result from the front face
-   If the output result has multiple type of items all the result items will be ejected together
-   The Crafter can be oriented in any direction when placed

#### Crafter UI

-   The Crafter has a 3x3 interactable crafting grid
-   The Crafter’s crafting grid slots are toggleable, meaning that the player can change the behavior of a slot by clicking or pressing on a slot with an empty hand
-   A slot that is ‘toggled’ cannot hold any items, and therefore cannot have items placed into it by other blocks, such as Hoppers and Droppers
-   Unlike the Crafting Table, the Crafter displays a preview of the crafted item which will be crafted and ejected on the next Redstone pulse but cannot be manually taken out by the player
-   The Crafter UI is shared between all players interacting with the Crafter, meaning that multiple players can interact with the Crafter at the same time, similar to Chests and Hoppers

#### Crafter interaction with other blocks

-   The Comparator signal strength is 0-9, where each non-empty or toggled slot adds 1 strength
-   Hoppers can be used to both insert and pull out items from the Crafter
-   Droppers can be used to insert items into the Crafter
-   Moving items in from another block (ex: Hopper, Dropper) prioritizes filling items into slots following these rules:
    -   Prioritize the first empty slot (from left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
    -   If there are no empty slots then prioritize the smallest stack of the same item (pick the first if there are multiple)
    -   If there is a toggled slot it will be skipped. The item will then be moved into the container
    -   If the item cannot be moved, it will be ejected into the world

We want to hear your feedback on the Crafter, so please let us know what you think the over in our dedicated [feedback thread](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/20459106029709-Let-s-talk-about-the-Crafter-).

## Changes

-   Added an accessibility option that allows to hide the yellow splash texts in the main menu
-   Added a recovery screen for worlds with missing data (for example, if saving failed due to an unexpected shutdown)

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 21
-   The Resource Pack version is now 19
-   Minor changes to chat component serialization

### Chat components

#### Serialization

-   The optional `type` field has a new allowed value: `selector`
-   Components of type `nbt` now have `source` field with allowed values `entity`, `block`, `storage`

## Data Pack Version 21

-   Introduced Jigsaw structure pool aliases, which can be used to rewire pool selection
-   Added field `block_state` to `tnt` entity to allow replacement of rendered block model
-   Renamed field `Fuse` to `fuse` on `tnt` entity
-   Added `playersNetherPortalDefaultDelay` and `playersNetherPortalCreativeDelay` gamerules to control time (in ticks) that a player needs to stand in a Nether portal before changing dimensions
-   Added new gamerule `projectilesCanBreakBlocks` to control whether impact projectiles will destroy blocks that are destructible by them, i.e. Chorus Flowers, Pointed Dripstone and Decorated Pots
-   Added `white_smoke` particle type

### Jigsaw pool aliases

-   Added optional `pool_aliases` list to Jigsaw structures
-   Aliases represent the possibility to rewire Jigsaw pool connections by redirecting pool references on individual structure instances
-   Alias variants are represented in `type` and is one of:
    -   `direct` 1:1 mapping from an alias to a new pool
        -   `alias` pool to replace
        -   `target` pool to replace with
    -   `random` 1:n mapping where a pool from `n` is randomly selected for the structure instance
        -   `alias` pool to replace
        -   `targets` randomized list of candidate pools to replace `alias` with
    -   `random_group`
        -   `groups` each group is a randomized list of above alias types
        -   only one group is selected per structure instance
        -   this enables modelling selections such as "if pool X is replaced with X1, also replace pool Y with Y1"

## Resource Pack Version 19

-   Added block model, item model and block state definitions for `crafter`
-   Added GUI container texture and sprites for `crafter`
-   Added `white_smoke` particle definition

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w41a

For this week's Snapshot, we've made improvements to the Decorated Pots!

Additionally, Realms is now available in Snapshots moving forward! Any player who has an active Realms subscription is eligible to create a free Snapshot Realm. This Snapshot Realm will be separate from your regular Realm to prevent any issues from impacting your regular Realm. For more information on how Snapshot Realms work, please see Realms in [Minecraft: Java Edition Snapshot FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/20143730191245).

## New Features

-   The version of the last played world on a Realm is displayed in the Realms list
-   Experiments are available for newly created worlds

## Changes

-   Decorated Pots can now store items, and can be smashed by projectiles

### Decorated Pots

-   Decorated Pots now store up to a single stack of items
-   Hoppers, Hopper Minecarts and Droppers can now insert and/or extract items from Decorated Pots
-   Comparators can now read the number of items in Decorated Pots
-   Players can interact with Decorated Pots to insert items into them
-   Decorated Pots have no GUI, and need to be broken to retrieve or discover their content by players
-   Player interactions with Decorated Pots cause the Decorated Pot to wobble and trigger the vibration frequency of 11
-   Decorated Pots can be smashed by projectiles which cause them to shatter and drop their content
-   Decorated Pots now stack up to 64

We want to hear your feedback on these improvements to Decorated Pots - let us know what you think in [our dedicated feedback site post](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/20289952762637-Let-s-talk-about-Decorated-Pot-improvements-)!

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 20
-   The name of non-living entities will now be shown if looked at and a CustomName is set, or always displayed if CustomNameVisible is set, similar to living entities

## Data Pack Version 20

-   Changed `function` command results
-   Adjusted check for gamerule `maxCommandChainLength`
-   Added new gamerule `maxCommandForkCount`
-   Reintroduced form of the `execute` command: `execute if function`
-   Reintroduced form of the `return` command: `return run`
-   Decorated Pots with `cracked` state set to true will always shatter when broken
-   Added new `dust_plume` particle type

### Commands

#### Functions

-   `function` command has been changed to better accomodate new `return` command
-   Functions no longer have any result unless they use `return` or there was error during lookup or instantiation
    -   That means `function` command will no longer return (or even display) number of commands run during execution
    -   Error conditions:
        -   Calling non-existent function
        -   Calling empty function tag
        -   Macro instantiation failure
-   "Result" in this context means values that would be stored with `execute store`
-   The previous behavior where every command in function would perform store if a function was called with `execute store ... run function` is removed
    -   That means that a single call to `function` will store at most once (zero times if `return` was not called)
    -   For function tags with multiple entries, function results will be accumulated, but partial results will be stored at the end of every function

##### Limits

Existing limits for functions have been refined to accomodate new execution rules and prevent wider range of exploits:

-   Limits apply even if run from command line (so it will now always behave as if they were placed in a function)
    -   For example, all functions called by `execute as @e run function` will count towards same limit
    -   Executions from command blocks still count as separate ones
-   Limit `maxCommandChainLength` for functions will now count "operations" like:
    -   execution of command for a single context
    -   execution of a stage in `execute` (no matter how many contexts were modified)
    -   invocation of function
-   New limit with game rule `maxCommandForkCount` now restricts total amount of context that can be created by single state of functions like `execute`
    -   Example: if there are 5 entities in world, `execute as @e` creates 5 contexts, while `execute as @e at @e` creates 5\*5 = 25 contexts

#### `execute if function`

An `execute` sub-command that runs a function or function tag and matches the return value(s). This is a reintroduction of functionality removed in previous version. If a tag is given, all functions run regardless of the results of prior functions.

Syntax: `execute if|unless function <function> <continuation>`

Parameters:

-   `function`: The function or tag to run

##### Matching

The matching of the result value of the function(s) that run:

-   At least one of the functions must succeed for the match to succeed
-   A succeessful call is defined as a function that:
    -   Uses the `return` command to return a value
    -   The return value is not 0
-   If no functions exited with `return`, neither `if` or `unless` will run

#### `return run`

A form of the `return` command is now available, `return run`. This is a reintroduction of functionality removed in previous version.

Syntax: `return run <command>`

This takes the `result` value from running the specified `command` and returns that as the return value of the function.

-   If command did not return any value (like, for example, call to a `function` without `return`), return will not execute and function will continue execution
-   If the given command fails, the return value is `0`
-   In all other aspects, it works like `return` with a specified return value
-   In case of fork (for example `return run execute as @e run some_command`) the first execution of the command will return
    -   If there are no executions (for example in `return run execute if @e[something_impossible] run some_command`) function will not return and will continue execution

-   A few minor changes to chat component serialization

### Chat components

-   Chat components now serialize to NBT when sent over network
-   Chat components now have an optional `type` value (allowed values: `text`, `translatable`, `score`, `nbt`, `keybind`) to speed up parsing and improve error checking
-   `id` field in `show_entity` `hoverEvent` style now also accepts UUID as an array of 4 ints
-   Numeric and boolean arguments for `translate` component are no longer converted to string
-   The following JSON component representations are no longer accepted:
    -   `null`
    -   `[]`

    -   `color`
    -   `clickEvent`
    -   `hoverEvent`
    -   `hoverEvent[action=show_entity].contents.name`
    -   `hoverEvent[action=show_item].contents.tag`

## Data Pack Version 19

# Minecraft 1.20.2 Pre-Release 1

Are you pre-pared for Pre-release 1 of 1.20.2? Moving into pre-releases means that, moving forward, you won't see any significant changes besides bug fixes and tweaks until the next snapshot cycle. It also means that we will be releasing more frequently than just Wednesdays, so keep your eyes peeled! However, Pre-release 1 brings new changes to the 'Villager Trade Rebalance' experiment, updates to Recipe Book search, command changes, and a new game rule!

Happy crafting!

## Changes

-   The Recipe Book search has been updated with the following changes:
    -   The search will only match the beginning of any word in the item's name
        -   For example, searching for "tor" will still show Torch and Redstone Torch but not Daylight Detector anymore
    -   All recipes, including those that have not been unlocked, will now show up in search results
    -   This will enable experienced players to find the recipes they are looking for (even if it hasn't been unlocked yet) without overwhelming new players
-   Updated structure icons on explorer maps sold by Cartographers
-   When villagers unlock new trades, the order of those trades in the UI is now always random instead of sometimes being deterministic

## Technical Changes

-   The data pack version is now 18
-   Client options are now sent during the configuration network phase when joining a server

### Data Pack Version 18

This data pack version removes the recently introduced `execute if function` and `return run` functionality. Flaws with those commands (see bugs [MC-264595](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-264595), [MC-264699](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-264699) and [MC-264710](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-264710)) require some substantial changes to fix, which we do not want to make close to a release.

These commands will instead be reintroduced early in the next snapshot series when we can take the time to iterate on and test them together with pack makers.

-   Removed `execute if|unless function` command form
-   Removed `return run` command form
-   Numbers used as macro arguments are now always inserted without suffixes, regardless of numeric type
-   Added game rule `enderPearlsVanishOnDeath`, controlling whether thrown ender pearls vanish when the player that threw them dies (default `true`)

## Experimental Features

### Villager Trade Rebalance Part 2

This pre-release updates the Villager Trade Rebalance experiment. This experiment has no effect on normal worlds. If you want to try these changes, you must turn on the Feature Toggle in the Experiments Menu when creating a new world. You can find more information about Feature Toggles [here](https://www.minecraft.net/article/testing-new-minecraft-features/feature-toggles-java-edition).

Thank you to everyone that has sent in their suggestions and feedback regarding the experimental trade change! We are trying out these changes to rebalance the villager trade system and make it more fair and fun for everyone. However, these changes are not yet final, and they will stay as experimental features while we continue to work on them. We appreciate your feedback on these changes. Visit [this link](https://aka.ms/VillagerTradingFeedback) to share your thoughts! We have been following the discussions about the previous Librarian and Wandering Trader updates and look forward to seeing the conversation continue.

#### Cartographer

Before now, Cartographers only sold maps to the Ocean Monument and Woodland Mansion. In this experiment Cartographers can sell seven new maps as well. These new maps each point to a different village or structure and can be used to find seven different biomes. This will help players who want to quickly find a specific location without waiting until they come across it by chance.

Cartographers from different biomes will sell a different selection of maps. Starting from one village, it will be possible to find every other village type by following maps from village to village.

Cartographers now sell 7 new maps: Desert Village Map, Jungle Explorer Map, Plains Village Map, Savanna Village Map, Snow Village Map, Swamp Explorer Map, and Taiga Village Map.

#### Armorer

The Armorer's trades have been updated with many changes.

The biggest change is that buying diamond armor now requires paying a small amount of Diamonds as well as Emeralds. This is meant to make the Armorer's diamond armor trades less useful at the start of the game when players don't have any Diamonds, while still giving a powerful advantage to advanced players who have spent some time collecting Diamonds.

Early-game players will find Armorers useful as a great source of iron armor, Shields and Emeralds.

Other changes include:

-   Most master-level Armorers buy Iron Blocks (and pay very well for them)
-   Chainmail armor is exclusively sold by the secret Jungle and Swamp Armorers
-   The Savanna Armorer sells cursed diamond armor at reduced prices
-   The Taiga Armorer can swap one piece of diamond armor for another

#### Structure Loot

Certain Enchanted Books now have a high chance of generating in some structures:

-   Ancient Cities: Mending
-   Mineshafts: Efficiency (I to V)
-   Pillager Outposts: Quick Charge (I to III)
-   Desert Temples: Unbreaking (I to III)
-   Jungle Temples: Unbreaking (I to III)

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w33a

We are making some important updates to our Player Reporting Tool in this Snapshot to better protect the online safety of our players.

Playing Minecraft should be an inclusive and safe experience for everyone, which is why alongside in-game chat messages, you will now be able to report player skins and usernames that violate our Community Standards in Java Edition.

Just like with chat reports, nothing is automated. Any reported skin or username will be reviewed manually by a team of trained Minecraft moderators, who will use the submitted evidence to decide whether the skin and/or username is in breach of our Community Standards. Skins that are in violation of these standards will be removed from Minecraft and will no longer be accessible for use by any player. Usernames that are in violation of these standards will need to be changed before that player can play online via a shared server or Realm; though single player mode will still be accessible. To find out more about this and other safety policies, including more detail on the suspension procedure, appeals process, and how we handle malicious or repeat reporting, please visit our dedicated FAQ page.

## New Features

### Player Skin & Name Reporting

-   Player Skins and Names can now be reported in the Social Interactions Screen
-   If a skin or name is reported, and found to be violating the [Community Standards](https://www.minecraft.net/community-standards), our team of human moderators can action in a few ways:
    -   Ban the skin from being used by any player
    -   Ban the name from being used by any player
    -   Suspend the player from online play in the case of repeated offences
-   When a skin is banned, players with that skin:
    -   Will have their skin removed
    -   Will be notified when they launch the game
    -   Will be automatically assigned one of the default skins
    -   Can still play multiplayer and singleplayer
    -   Can select a new custom skin at any time
-   When a player's name is banned, that player:
    -   Will need to choose a new name
    -   Will be notified when they launch the game
    -   Will not be able to play online until they change their name
    -   Can still play singleplayer
-   A skin or name that has been banned cannot be used by any player in the future

## Changes

-   Sponges and Wet Sponges now have their own custom sounds
-   The calculations to determine whether a mob can attack a player or other mobs have been changed
-   Added the "Narrator Hotkey" accessibility option
    -   Allows the narrator to be toggled on and off with `Ctrl+B`
-   Added "I want to report them" Player Reporting category
-   A change has been reverted where armor trim patterns would be masked by the underlying armor texture

### Mob attack reach changes

The calculations to determine whether a mob can attack a player or other mobs have been changed. Previously a mob's horizontal width was used to determine their attack reach and their height had no effect. The area where a mob can attack is now their bounding box extended in horizontal directions.

Here are some situations where the new rules will affect the reach of mobs:

-   If a mob is entirely below you, or entirely above you, it will not be able to reach you
-   While riding on a medium-sized mob, like a Horse, you will be protected from small mobs, like Baby Zombies
-   While riding on a tall mob, like a Camel, you will be protected from standard-size mobs, like Zombies
-   Also, Ravagers won't be able to attack you through a few block thick walls anymore
-   However, to escape from an Enderman, you need to be at least 3 blocks above the ground, not 1.5 as before
-   Mobs will be able to attack you with the bottom of their hitbox, assuming your head is in range
-   Builds that trap hostile mobs might need to be adjusted to be safe

This change does not affect the reach of players, and mobs still need to see their target to attack it. We believe this new system will be more intuitive and will result in a more consistent behavior, and we welcome all feedback on this change.

## Technical Changes

-   The charts on the debug screen can now be toggled with F3+1 (pie chart), F3+2 (FPS and TPS) and F3+3 (bandwidth and ping) instead of holding Shift, Alt or Ctrl while opening the screen

### Data Pack Changes

-   Added `decal` field to armor trim patterns (default: `false`)
    -   If `true`, the pattern texture will be masked based on the underlying armor

## Fixed bugs in 23w33a

-   [MC-2310](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-2310) Wrong attack radius calculation damages/kills entities through blocks and corners

-   Sweet Berries being eaten by Foxes emit a `block_change` vibration of frequency 11
-   Camels eating Cactus emit an `eat` vibration of frequency 8

## Technical Changes

-   The resource pack version is now 17
-   A bug involving hunger icons was fixed in the slicer tool released with last snapshot. Here is [the new version](https://github.com/Mojang/slicer/releases/tag/v1.1.1)
-   The data pack version is now 17
-   Optimized networking to improve the experience on low bandwidth connections

### Resource Pack Version 17

-   The text field background is now a nine-sliced sprite at `widget/text_field` and `widget/text_field_highlighted`
-   The scroll bar in lists and text fields is now a nine-sliced sprite at `widget/scroller`

### Data Pack Version 17

-   Changed mob effect storage on items, entities and block entities

#### Mob effect storage changes

-   Game no longer uses numeric values when storing mob effects to world (so, for example, `4` becomes `minecraft:mining_fatigue`)
-   Various mob effect fields have been renamed for consistency with new structures

##### Mob Effect Instance

This structure is used in many places, so changes are described separately.

-   `Id` -> `id`, also changed from number to string id
-   `Ambient` -> `ambient`
-   `Amplifier` -> `amplifier`
-   `Duration` -> `duration`
-   `ShowParticles` -> `show_particles`
-   `ShowIcon` -> `show_icon`
-   `HiddenEffect` -> `hidden_effect`, also since it's mob effect instance, changes apply recursively
-   `FactorCalculationData` -> `factor_calculation_data`

##### Items

###### `potion`, `lingering_potion`, `splash_potion`, `tipped_arrow`

-   `CustomPotionEffects` -> `custom_potion_effects`, contents tranformed as a list of mob effect instances

###### `suspicous_stew`

-   `Effects` -> `effects`, for each entry:
    -   `EffectId` -> `id`, also changed from number to string id
    -   `EffectDuration` -> `duration`

##### Entities

###### `mooshroom`

-   Removed `EffectId` and `EffectDuration`
-   Added `stew_effects` with the same format as `suspicious_stew.effects` tag (i.e. list of effect id and duration)

###### `area_effect_cloud`

-   `Effects` -> `effects`, contents tranformed as a list of mob effect instances

###### `arrow`

-   `CustomPotionEffects` -> `custom_potion_effects`, contents tranformed as a list of mob effect instances

###### Players, Armor Stands and mobs

-   `ActiveEffects` -> `active_effects`, contents tranformed as a list of mob effect instances

##### Block Entities

###### `beacon`

-   `Primary` -> `primary_effect`, also changed from number to string id
-   `Secondary` -> `secondary_effect`, also changed from number to string id

#### Loot Tables

-   Added `sequence` loot function
    -   Contains 1 field:
        -   `functions`: an array of sub-functions to run in sequence
    -   Can also be declared as an inline array with out a type
        -   This matches the existing behavior where loot function JSON files can be declared as an array of composite functions
-   `all_of` predicates in loot tables can now be declared implicitly as an inline array without a type
    -   This similarly matches the existing behavior where loot predicate JSON files can be declared as an array of sub-predicates

### Network optimizations

-   Gameplay packets are now packed into bigger TCP-packets to reduce overhead from TCP-headers, significantly reducing network usage
-   Opening the debug screen with CTRL + F3 will now show charts for ping and received network traffic

### Secure Chat

-   Clients will no longer disconnect themselves when receiving an invalid chat message
    -   A placeholder message will instead be shown in chat

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w31a

I was personally quite convinced that the game was already perfect, but it seems that our developers disagree. We are now releasing the first snapshot for Minecraft 1.20.2!

This snapshot brings changes to Diamond Ore generation, the ability to waterlog Barriers, and a change to Villager curing. It also brings a new Experimental Toggle that updates Villager trading, which we are eager to hear your feedback on. As well as a big batch of bug fixes, you will find a whole lot of technical features and changes in this snapshot, including new commands, function macros, persistent command history, network performance improvements, and much more.

Happy mining!

## New Experimental Features in 23w31a

### Villager Trade Rebalance

This snapshot introduces a new experimental Feature Toggle that updates the Wandering Trader and Librarian trades. You must turn on this Feature Toggle in the Experiments Menu when creating a new world if you want to test the new trades. You can find more information about Feature Toggles [here](https://www.minecraft.net/article/testing-new-minecraft-features/feature-toggles-java-edition).

As this is an experiment, we would really appreciate your feedback as work continues and to help us decide on the future direction for Villager trades. Visit [this link](https://aka.ms/VillagerTradingFeedback) to share your thoughts!

#### Librarian Changes

Before these changes, players could get any village enchantment from any Librarian. A novice Librarian could sell the best enchantment in the game! For some players, this felt too random and made trading feel overpowered when compared to using the Enchanting Table or searching for Enchanted Books in structures.

With the new rules, Librarians from different biomes sell different enchantments, and each village biome has one enchantment that is only sold by master Librarians.

Players will have to work towards getting the best trades instead of relying on random chance. We hope this makes Librarian trading more interesting and skillful, while also revealing some clues about their history of each village type through the enchantments that are sold there.

-   Librarians from different biomes now sell different Enchanted Books
-   Each village biome has one special enchantment that is only available from Master Librarians with full XP
-   This means that players must visit all seven village biomes to get the full set of villager enchantments
-   There are two secret village biomes where villages do not generate
    -   A player must build these villages to access their trades!
-   Some enchantments have been removed from village trading and must be found in other ways

#### Wandering Trader Changes

Some players felt that the Wandering Trader had unfair prices and didn't sell many useful items. We have lowered their prices, added more trades and increased the amounts available. The Wandering Trader will also now buy useful items from players, so it's possible to help them on their journey by giving them supplies even if you don't feel like buying anything.

-   Wandering Traders now have lower prices and have a higher amount of each item in stock
-   Wandering Traders now sell Logs
-   Wandering Traders can now buy many items, instead of only selling

## Changes

-   Diamond Ore is now generated more frequently in the Deepslate layers of the Overworld
-   Curing a Zombie Villager now only gives a big discount the first time
    -   There is no longer a bonus discount for reinfecting and curing the same Villager multiple times
-   Barrier blocks can now be waterlogged by players in Creative mode
    -   Water cannot be placed in them or taken out by non-direct interactions such as Dispensers
-   Players will no longer be able to crouch while riding vehicles
-   Chorus Flower no longer provides support for hanging or standing blocks

### Diamond Ore Distribution

In this snapshot, we have increased the amount of Diamond Ore found in the deepest parts of the world. Our goal is to make it more rewarding to mine for Diamonds in the Deepslate layers. We want your feedback on this! Please try out your favorite mining technique and let us know how it feels on [this feedback site](https://aka.ms/OreDistributionFeedback).

## Technical Changes

-   The resource pack version is now 16
-   The data pack version is now 16
-   History of used commands is now saved and accessible across worlds
-   Optimized the way chunks are sent to clients to allow players with low-bandwidth internet connections to play on multiplayer servers
-   Added support for multi-version packs
-   Changed network protocol to allow for more data-driven content in the future
-   Added new `log-ips` option to `server.properties`
-   Added validation for symbolic links in datapacks and resource packs
-   When hitboxes are displayed through F3+B, entities that have a passenger will display the passenger's attachment point

### Command History

-   The last 50 commands that you sent in chat will be remembered across game sessions
-   You can access the command and chat history by pressing up or down arrows in the chat
-   Regular chat is only persisted within the same game session (leaving a server or world clears them)
-   Recent commands are stored in `command_history.txt` in the game folder

### Chunk Sending Optimization

-   Chunks are no longer sent over the network to the client in one big continuous batch
-   They are instead sent in smaller batches depending on the available bandwidth. This means that:
    -   Clients with extremely low-bandwidth connections will not time out while loading the world
    -   Clients with low-bandwidth connections can interact with the world while some chunks are still loading
-   Only chunks within the client's render distance are now sent

### Multi-version Packs

New features have been added to datapacks and resource packs to allow creation of packs that are compatible with multiple versions of game.

#### Pack Metadata

-   Pack metadata now includes an optional field `supported_formats` which describes a range for pack formats that this pack supports
    -   Examples: `16`, `[16,17]`, `{"min_inclusive": 16, "max_inclusive": 17}`
-   `pack_format` field is still required and its format remains unchanged, to allow older game versions to read pack data
    -   If `supported_formats` is present, it must contain the value declared in `pack_format`
    -   Note: since this new information is ignored by older versions of the game, they will always see a "normal", single-version pack, without any extended compatibility

#### Overlays

-   Packs can now contain overlay directories ("overlays")
-   Overlays are sub-packs applied over the "normal" contents of a pack
    -   These directories have the same layout as the top-level pack, including the `assets` and `data` directories
    -   Overlays can be applied if they support the client's pack format
    -   Overlays can add and replace files, but not remove them
        -   For example, if the overlay `foo` is applied, the file `foo/assets/minecraft/textures/bar.png` will replace contents of `assets/minecraft/textures/bar.png`
    -   `pack.mcmeta` and `pack.png` are ignored in overlay directories
-   New section called `overlays` have been added to pack metadata
    -   It contains an `entries` field, containing a list of overlays
    -   Every overlay entry has two fields:
        -   `formats` - range of supported formats
        -   `directory` - overlay directory (allowed characters: `a-z`, `0-9`, `_` and `-`)
-   Order of application: overlays are stacked from the bottom to top of the list
    -   For example, if a pack has two overlays: `"entries": [{"directory":"A", ...}, {"directory":"B", ...}]`, the game will first look in `B`, then `A` and then in the top pack directory

### Network Protocol

As part of ongoing work towards more data-driven features, the network protocol has been changed to include a new configuration phase.

-   Configuration phase automatically starts after login phase (i.e. after client account has been verified) and lasts until the player joins the world (play phase)
-   Clients can stay in configuration phase indefinitely - it's up to server to release it to the world
-   Servers can also request clients to re-enter the configuration phase after it has entered the play phase
    -   Other players will see such clients as disconnected
-   Users in configuration phase will not be visible on the player list
-   Actions allowed in configuration phase (moved from play phase)
    -   Configuration of data-driven registries
    -   Configuration of enabled features
-   Actions shared between configuration and play phases:
    -   Application of server resource packs
    -   Update of tags
    -   Exchange of custom packets
    -   Ping and keep-alive packets
-   The server will now negotiate resource pack in the configuration phase
    -   This means that the player will no longer be in world when answering prompts and reloading resources

### `server.properties`

-   New option: `log-ips` (default true)
    -   When set to `false`, will prevent player IPs from being included in the log when players join the game

### Symbolic Link Validation

To improve safety, the game will now also detect symbolic links used inside data- and resource packs.

-   This feature expands on symbolic link validation in worlds added in the previous release
-   The game will now warn users if a pack added via drag and drop contains disallowed symbolic links
-   Packs containing disallowed symbolic links will not be visible in UI and commands
-   Additionally, directories and files that are not recognized as packs will no longer be copied via drag and drop
-   For a detailed explanation, see this [help article](https://aka.ms/MinecraftSymLinks)

### Telemetry

-   Added a button to the Telemetry Data Collection Screen that links to the Microsoft Privacy Statement

### Resource Pack Version 16

-   The process of upgrading your pack can be assisted by using this automated [Slicer](https://github.com/Mojang/slicer/releases/tag/v1.1) tool
-   All textures containing multiple sprites in a sheet for GUI have been split into individual sprites under `textures/gui/sprites` (automated by Slicer tool)
-   All textures in the `realms` namespace have been moved into the `minecraft` namespace (automated by Slicer tool)
-   `villager2.png` has been renamed to `villager.png` (automated by Slicer tool)
-   `icon/trial_available` and `realm_status/expires_soon` GUI sprites are animated with `.mcmeta` declarations instead of individual sprites (automated by Slicer tool)
-   The bundle tooltip background is now drawn as a nine-sliced sprite
-   The icons for the Accessibility, Language, Realms News buttons have been split from their underlying button texture
-   The Realms Invite button is now drawn as an overlay on the normal button texture
    -   The highlighted texture state for this button has been removed
-   The highlighted states for Realms invitation number icons have been removed
-   The exclamation marks on the `notification\more.png` have been removed

#### GUI Sprite Sheet

-   Sprites used in GUI drawing have been split into individual sprite files instead of larger sprite sheets
    -   For example, `widgets/button.png` and `widgets/button_highlighted.png` have been split from `widgets.png`
-   Each sprite can now be individually overriden by a resource pack instead of replacing the entire sheet
-   Sprites are loaded into the `gui` atlas from the `textures/gui/sprites` directory

##### GUI Sprite .mcmeta

-   Any sprite can now be animated using `.mcmeta` files, similar to other atlases
    -   `icon/trial_available` and `realm_status/expires_soon` are now animated this way
-   Sprites in the `gui` atlas can now configure scaling behavior through a new `gui` section in `.mcmeta` files
    -   For example, button textures must be scaled based on how big the button should be
    -   The `gui` section in `.mcmeta` contains one `scaling` field:
        -   `type`: one of: `stretch` (default), `tile`, or `nine_slice`
        -   When `stretch`, the sprite will be stretched across the desired space
            -   No additional fields need to be defined
        -   When `tile`, the sprite will be repeated across the desired space, starting from the top-left
            -   `width`: number of pixels for this sprite to cover on-screen across its width
            -   `height`: number of pixels for this sprite to cover on-screen across its height
        -   When `nine_slice`, the sprite will be sliced into 4 corners, 4 edges, and 1 center slice, which will be tiled across the desired space
            -   `width`: number of pixels for this sprite to cover on-screen across its width
            -   `height`: number of pixels for this sprite to cover on-screen across its height
            -   `border`: the size in pixels that the border slices should cover on-screen, one of:
                -   Constant integer for uniform border size on all sides
                -   Object containing `left`, `top`, `right`, and `bottom`

### Data Pack Version 16

-   Gamerule `randomTickSpeed` now affects the rate of accumulation of snow and ice the same way it affects crops and other blocks affected by random ticking
-   Added a `random` command
-   New form of the `execute` command: `execute if function`
-   New form of the `return` command: `return run`
-   Added support for function macros
-   Changed Display entities post-teleport interpolation
-   Added new attribute `generic.max_absorption`
-   Renamed `belowName` value in display slot argument in `scoreboard` command to `below_name`
-   Game event changes
-   New tags

#### Commands

##### `random`

A new command for randomizing values and controlling random sequences. The `value` and `roll` forms can be used to draw a random value. In the case of `roll`, the resulting value is also shown in chat for all players.

Syntax:

    random value|roll <range> [<sequenceId>]
    random reset *|<sequenceId> [<seed>] [<includeWorldSeed>] [<includeSequenceId>]
    

Parameters:

-   `range`: A range of values to randomize between, inclusively
    -   For instance, 1..6 is a regular D6 roll
-   `sequenceId`: The name of a random sequence to sample or reset
-   `seed`: A seed to use for the random sequence after reset
-   `includeWorldSeed`: A boolean \[default: `true`\] specifying whether to include the world seed when seeding the sequence
    -   `false` means the sequence will evaluate to the same regardless of which world the command is run in
-   `includeSequenceId`: A boolean \[default: `true`\] specifying whether to include the sequence ID when seeding the sequence
    -   `false` means all sequences will evaluate to the same regardless of which name they have

By default, all sequences are seeded as `0`, `true`, `true`. Using `*` instead of a sequence ID resets all sequences and sets the default parameters.

If no seed is specified, the sequence resets to the default parameters.

Note that `random value|roll <range>` used without a sequence id is available to non-operator players.

##### `execute if function`

A new execute sub-command that runs a function or function tag and matches the return value(s). If a tag is given, all functions run regardless of the results of prior functions. Syntax:

`execute if|unless function <function> <continuation>`

Parameters:

-   `function`: The function or tag to run

###### Matching

The matching of the result value of the function(s) that run:

-   At least one of the functions must succeeed for the match to succeed
-   A succeessful call is defined as a function that:
    -   Uses the `return` command to return a value
    -   The return value is not 0

##### `return run`

A new form of the `return` command is now available, `return run`. Syntax:

`return run <command>`

This takes the `result` value from running the specified `command` and returns that as the return value of the function. In all other aspects, it works like `return` with a specified return value. If the given command fails, the return value is `0`.

#### Functions

-   A single backslash `\` as the last non-whitespace character of a line now allows a command to be continued on the next line
    -   Leading and trailing whitespace of the following line are stripped before appending

##### Macros

Functions can now contain macro lines, making them Function Macros.

-   Any line beginning with `$` (as the first non-space character) marks a macro line
-   A macro line also contains one or more substitutions in the form of `$(variable)`
-   When calling a function macro a compound with data for all argument variables must be provided

###### Calling Function Macros

The `function` command has new forms:

`function <id> <compound>` `function <id> with <data source> [<path>]`

New Arguments:

-   `compound`: A data compound, enclosed in `{}`
-   `data source`: A data source specification, like what could already be used for `data get`
-   `path`: An NBT path specification

Notes:

-   The data source and path must specify a compound data entry
-   The compound must contain one entry for each variable used in the macro
-   More data may be present in the compound and if so is ignored
-   Calling a non-macro function with a data compound is silently ignored
-   When a macro is called, the values provided are substituted in place of the variable specifications and the resulting commands are executed
-   Any syntax errors in the lines resulting from variable substitution result in the entire function call being skipped

###### Performance Considerations

Using a macro means commands must be re-evaulated after variable substitution. This has an extra cost compared to running pre-parsed functions.

Regular commands (non-macro lines) are still pre-parsed. Only commands with variable substitutions in them are parsed when a macro is called and the game will attempt to cache the result of a certain parameter set being used in a call.

This makes repeated calls with the same parameter set cheaper than new calls with different parameters, but an overhead still remains compared to regular functions. Note that only the values references by macro as parameters are included in this cache, so any extra data in the provided compound is ignored.

#### Display Entity Interpolation

-   Display entities now start updating their client-side position and rotation on the first tick after an update
    -   In previous versions, updates were applied in the same tick, causing uneven motion
    -   New behavior is now similar to armor stands, mobs and players
-   On the server, position and rotation are still updated immediately
-   Duration of this interpolation is controlled by the field `teleport_duration`
    -   `0` means that updates are applied immediately
    -   `1` means that the display entity will move from current position to the updated one over one tick
    -   Higher values spread the movement over multiple ticks
    -   Please note that this value is clamped to avoid glitches due to periodic position updates
    -   The new value will apply only to position and rotation changes made after it changed
        -   That means any current movement will continue unchanged
-   Note: behavior while riding remains unchanged from previous versions

#### Attributes

-   Added new attribute `generic.max_absorption`
    -   `generic.max_absorption` acts similar to `generic.max_health`, but instead of being the upper bound for `Health`, it is the upper bound for `AbsorptionAmount`
    -   The mob effect `absorption` increases `generic.max_absorption` as well as fills the `AbsorptionAmount` to the max when applied

#### Game Events

-   `entity_roar` and `entity_shake` game events have been removed and replaced with `entity_action` game event

#### Tags

-   Added `no_knockback` damage type tag which causes knockback to not be caused by the damage itself
    -   Used in Vanilla for damage that is caused by events, such as explosions, which apply knockback separately
-   Added `non_controlling_rider` to represent entities that don't override their vehicles movement control
-   Added `concrete_powder` block tag for Concrete Powder blocks
-   Added `camel_sand_step_sound_blocks` block tag for blocks that produce `entity.camel.step_sand` sound

# Minecraft 1.20.1 Release Candidate 1

We're now releasing a Release Candidate for a first minor update for Minecraft 1.20. This minor update will be a stability issue to fix some critical issues found after the release of Minecraft 1.20.

# Minecraft 1.20 Release Candidate 1

We are now releasing the first, and hopefully only, release-candidate for 1.20, containing two bug fixes. If all goes well, no further changes will be made before the full release of Minecraft 1.20 on Wednesday next week.

Happy crafting!

## Fixed bugs in 1.20 Release Candidate 1

-   [MC-256477](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-256477) Knowledge books can't be placed in chiseled bookshelves

# Minecraft 1.20 Pre-release 7

Pre-release 7 for Minecraft 1.20 is now available in the Minecraft Launcher. This pre-release adds validation of symbolic links and fixes a bug.

### Changes

To improve safety, the game will now detect symbolic links used inside world directory. For a detailed explanation, check our [help article](https://aka.ms/MinecraftSymLinks).

-   If the target of a symbolic link is not on the user-configured allow-list, the game will not proceed with loading the world
    -   Note: world directory itself can still be linked
-   The list of allowed symbolic link targets is stored in file `allowed_symlinks.txt` in client or server top directory
-   The file consists of entries (one per line) with following formats allowed:
    -   Lines starting with `#` are comments and are ignored
    -   `[type]pattern`, where `type` can be `glob`, `regex` or `prefix`
        -   `prefix` matches start of path with given pattern (so for `/test` paths `/test`, `/test/` and `/test/foo.txt` would match)
        -   `regex` matches regular expression against whole path
        -   `glob` uses OS-specific path matching mechanism (for example `*.txt` would usually match files with `txt` extension)
        -   Note: paths will use OS-specific separators
    -   `pattern`, which uses default `prefix` type

## Fixed bug in 1.20 Pre-release 7

-   [MC-257778](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-257778) Bamboo Mosaic Slabs and Stairs are not in the #slabs and #stairs block and item tags

---

# Minecraft 1.20 Pre-Release 6

The sixth pre-release of the 1.20 update is here, yet again containing more bug fixes.

Happy mining!

## Technical Changes

-   `"item": "minecraft:air"` can no longer be used in datapack recipes
-   Ingredients in array form are now also allowed in `smithing_trim` and `smithing_transform` recipes on fields `template`, `base` and `addition`
    -   Those fields also allow empty arrays, which signalize that slot needs to be left empty

### Loot tables

#### Random sequences

The ID of the random sequence is now an optional field. If no sequence name is given, loot is drawn using a non-deterministic random source.

## Fixed bugs in 1.20 Pre-Release 6

-   [MC-237042](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-237042) Killing players in the sneaking state that have their sneak option set to "Toggle" in their accessibility settings, results in other players not being able to see them in this state when they respawn

# Minecraft 1.20 Pre-release 1 

It is now time for the first Pre-release for Minecraft 1.20: The Trails and Tales update!

From now on, you should mostly see bugs being fixed. In addition to that, pre-releases don't follow the regular snapshot cadence of releasing on Wednesdays, so keep an eye out for the next pre-release.

As always, a big thank you to the community for your feedback, bugs reported, and awesome ideas throughout the snapshot series. Let the pre-releases commence!

## Changes

-   Colored Wool, Carpets and Beds can now be dyed to any other color

## Technical Changes

-   Added new damage types: `outside_border` and `generic_kill`
-   Random sequences for loot tables are now deterministic
-   Changes in `server.properties` encoding
-   `string` data sources for the `data` command now accept negative boundaries, which are interpreted as index counted from the end of the string

### Damage Types

-   Players outside the world border are now hurt by the damage type `outside_border` instead of `in_wall`
-   Forcibly removing an entity using i.e. the `/kill` command now uses damage type `generic_kill` instead of `out_of_world`

### Loot Table Random Sequences

The game now uses named random sequences to deterministically produce loot for loot tables. Each random sequence produces a unique sequence based on the world seed and sequence ID, which means a loot table will produce the same results when ran with the same parameters in the same world.

The ID of the random sequence to use for a loot table is specified in a new field called `random_sequence`.

### `server.properties`

-   File is now read in UTF-8 initially, with previous encoding (ISO 8859-1/Latin 1) as a fallback
-   File is now written with UTF-8 encoding

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w18a

In this snapshot we're bringing you an additional advancement, updates to telemetry, as well as a fix for an 11 year old bug!

Happy stepping!

## New Features

### New advancements

#### Adventure advancements

-   `The Power of Books` : Read the power signal of a Chiseled Bookshelf using a Comparator

## Changes

-   For ease of use, the Smithing Table no longer requires a Smithing Template to be in the template slot before placing an itemstack into the other slots
-   Jukebox has been added to the Redstone Blocks creative tab

### Step Sounds

-   Walking on a block will now always play a step sound
    -   It was previously not the case if you were walking along the edge of a block with air or fluid besides it
-   Walking on the ocean floor will produce a step sound for the block you are walking on at a lower volume and pitch

## Technical Changes

-   The data pack version is now 15, accounting for sign data format, item display orientation and advancement changes
-   Advancement trigger changes:
    -   Added `recipe_crafted`
    -   Changed format of `placed_block`, `item_used_on_block` and `allay_drop_item_on_block` triggers
-   Loot table condition/predicate changes:
    -   Renamed `alternative` to `any_of`
    -   Added `all_of`
-   Updates to telemetry
    -   A new property has been added to every event: `launcher_name`
    -   The `world_loaded` event now has a new property: `realms_map_content`
    -   Added two new opt-in telemetry events: `game_load_times` and `advancement_made`

### Advancements

#### Changed triggers

-   All fields in `placed_block`, `item_used_on_block` and `allay_drop_item_on_block` have been collapsed to a single `location` field
-   New `location` is similar to `player` field - it's a list of loot conditions/predicates
-   All conditions in this list must match for a trigger to run
-   Conditions are evaluated in a new loot context called `advancement_location`. It has access to:
    -   Player as `this` entity
    -   Position of placed block
    -   Block state of placed/interacted block
    -   Held/used item as "tool"
-   Migration guide:
    -   Contents of old `location` field should be migrated to `location_check` condition
    -   Contents of `item` field should be migrated to `match_tool` condition
    -   Contents of `block` + `state` fields should be migrated to `block_state_property` condition

**Example** (from `make_a_sign_glow` advancement):

Before:

    {
        "conditions": {
            "item": {
                "items": [
                    "minecraft:glow_ink_sac"
                ]
            },
            "location": {
                "block": {
                    "tag": "minecraft:all_signs"
                }
            }
        },
        "trigger": "minecraft:item_used_on_block"
    }
    

After:

    {
        "conditions": {
            "location": [
                {
                    "condition": "minecraft:match_tool",
                    "predicate": {
                        "items": [
                            "minecraft:glow_ink_sac"
                        ]
                    }
                },
                {
                    "condition": "minecraft:location_check",
                    "predicate": {
                        "block": {
                            "tag": "minecraft:all_signs"
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        },
        "trigger": "minecraft:item_used_on_block"
    }
    

### Loot tables

#### `any_of`/`all_of`

-   Loot condition `alternative` has been renamed to `any_of`
-   Added new loot condition `all_of` that passes only when all sub-conditions pass. It has the same syntax as `any_of`

### Telemetry

This release includes a new global property sent with every event, a new property in the required WorldLoaded event, as well as two new opt-in events. The updated required events will help us troubleshoot launcher bugs more efficiently, and understand how Java Realms content is interacted with. The updated optional events will help inform game design decisions, and allow us to track and improve game load speeds.

#### All events

-   Added new property: `launcher_name`
    -   This is set based on the `minecraft.launcher.brand` system property. This will help us troubleshoot game launch related bugs more effectively, as we will be able to see whether the issue originated in the Minecraft launcher or a third-party program.

#### Updated required events

-   `world_loaded`
    -   Added new property: `realms_map_content`
        -   When loading into a Realms Map Content world (Minigame), the `world_loaded` event will receive the name of that map. This is to help us understand how Java Realms users interact with Java Realms adventure or minimap content.

#### New optional events

-   `advancement_made`
    -   This event is triggered when a player completes an advancement, and allows us to see the advancement ID and the time when the advancement was completed. This helps us as a studio understand player progress and limits, which informs our game design.
-   `game_load_times`
    -   An event that is triggered when the game client is loaded and includes the time it took for the client to load. This is so that we can work on improving and reducing the time it takes to load the game client.

-   Added the following new music tracks by Aaron Cherof to Cherry Groves, Desert, Jungle, Badlands, and Flower Forest biomes
    -   A Familiar Room
    -   Bromeliad
    -   Crescent Dunes
    -   Echo in the Wind

### New music disc

-   Added a new music disc which can be found by brushing suspicious blocks in Trail Ruins
    -   When put in a Jukebox, Relic by Aaron Cherof is played

## Changes

-   Both types of Sculk Sensors now stay in their Cooldown phase for 10 ticks, with other phase timings being adjusted to compensate
-   Crafted Decorated Pots with at least one pattern now have a hover tooltip displaying the Sherd & Brick ingredients
-   Updated the credits
    -   Added the ability to scroll upwards by pressing the `up arrow` key

### Sculk Sensor Phases

-   Sculk Sensors and Calibrated Sculk Sensors have three phases: Inactive, Active and Cooldown
-   The default phase is Inactive
    -   This phase lasts indefinitely until the block receives a vibration
    -   During this phase, the block is able to listen to nearby vibrations until one has been scheduled
-   When a scheduled vibration is received, the block switches to the Active phase
    -   This phase lasts 30 game ticks for Sculk Sensors, and 10 game ticks for Calibrated Sculk Sensors
    -   During this phase, the block stops listening to nearby vibrations, wiggles its tendrils and emits a redstone signal and light
-   After the Active phase has finished, the block switches to a Cooldown phase
    -   This phase lasts for 10 game ticks
    -   During this phase, the block keeps wiggling its tendrils, but no longer emits a redstone signal nor light
    -   Finally, once this phase is finished, the block will switch back to the Inactive phase
-   Previously, some of these phases had different timing values:
    -   Active: 40 game ticks for Sculk Sensors and 20 game ticks for Calibrated Sculk Sensors
    -   Cooldown: 1 game tick for both types of Sculk Sensors
-   These phase timings were tweaked so that it is less common for activated contraptions to recursively activate the Sculk Sensor that powered them

## Technical Changes

-   The resource pack version is now 15, accounting for the font and credits update
    -   `legacy_unicode` glyph provider has been removed
    -   Bitmaps used by `uniform` font have been removed
    -   `uniform` font has been updated to use Unifont 15.0.01
        -   That changes shape of multiple characters, while also adding support for new ones
        -   Combining characters no longer include circle overlayed over them (so M◌̆ now renders as M ̆)
    -   Added second level of organization of entries in credits.json on top of `titles`, called `disciplines`
-   Font textures are included in debug texture dump (F3 + S)
-   Added new font glyph providers: `unihex` and `reference`, removed `legacy_unicode`
-   Improved performance of the light engine

### Fonts

#### New `unihex` glyph provider

-   New glyph provider for reading Unifont HEX files
    -   HEX format describes bitmap font glyphs
        -   height of every glyph is 16 pixels
        -   width of glyph can be 8, 16, 24 or 32 pixels
    -   every line is made of two hexadecimal numbers separated by `:`
    -   first value describes codepoint - it must have 4, 5 or 6 hex digits
    -   second value describes glyph as a stream of bits, line by line
-   When rendering, empty columns on left and right side of glyph are removed
    -   Custom glyph widths can be set with `size_overrides`
-   Provider requires two fields:
    -   `hex_file` - path to ZIP archive containing one or more `*.hex` files (files in archive with different extensions are ignored)
    -   `size_overrides` - list of codepoint ranges that should have width different that auto-detected (based on empty space in glyph). Fields:
        -   `from`, `to` - start and end of codepoint range (inclusive)
        -   `left`, `right` - integers describing position of left-most and right-most columns of glyph in range
            -   any bits in columns outside this range will be discarded

#### New `reference` glyph provider

-   New glyph provider can be used to include providers from other fonts
    -   Providers are guaranteed to be loaded only once, no matter how many times they are included
-   Provider has one field `id`, that describes other font to be included in currently loaded one
    -   Inclusion is performed after all fonts are loaded, so it will include all providers for a given font defined in all datapacks

#### Removed `legacy_unicode` glyph provider

-   `legacy_unicode` glyph provider has been removed
-   This functionality has been replaced by `unihex` provider

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w16a

In this weeks Snapshot we're bringing you tweaks to the Trail Ruins, new command functionality, a new advancement trigger, and more!

Happy mining!

Edit: We have published a fix for a crash issue in this Snapshot. If you are experiencing crashes, please try closing all instances of the game and restarting the Launcher.

## Changes

-   All Pottery Shards has been renamed to Pottery Sherds
-   If a vibration is scheduled to be received by a Sculk Sensor or Sculk Shrieker, they will stay queued until all adjacent chunks are loaded and ticking
    -   Prevents vibration resonance setups from breaking when unloading their chunks from a distance
-   The game's application icon has been updated
    -   This will be a Grass Block in release versions, and a Dirt Block in snapshot versions
-   Added native support for ARM64 machine architecture on Windows
    -   To try this out, you need to manually specify a native Java Executable in the launcher

### Sniffer

-   Sniffers can now be tempted by Torchflower seeds

### Trail Ruins

-   Reworked structures based on community feedback
-   Added more structure variants
-   Sand no longer generates within the structures
-   Tweaked the amount of gravel and dirt
-   Tweaked the amount of Suspicious Gravel
-   Split the loot tables for the Suspicious Gravel within the structure. There is now a dedicated loot table for Rare loot items (e.g. Pottery Sherds, Smithing Templates), and a dedicated loot table for more common loot drops (e.g. Stained Glass Pane, Tools, Candles, etc.)
-   Due to these changes you might see errors like `Failed to get element ResourceKey[minecraft:worldgen/processor_list / minecraft:trail_ruins_suspicious_sand]` in an old snapshot world. These are harmless, but existing Trail Ruin structures that was not previously fully loaded might be missing parts of the structure.

## Technical Changes

-   The data pack version is now 14, accounting for item display orientation changes
-   Added a `return` command
-   Added `recipe_crafted` advancement trigger

### Commands

#### `return`

The `return` command can be used to control execution flow inside functions and change their return value. Effects:

-   Remaining separate top-level commands in the currently executing function (if any) are skipped
-   The result value of the `function` command that triggered the function is changed from the number of commands executed to `value`
-   The result value of the `return` command is also `value`

Syntax:

`return <value>`

Parameters:

-   `value`: An integer return value

### Advancements

#### New triggers

##### `recipe_crafted`

-   Triggered when crafting a recipe
-   Conditions:
    -   `recipe_id` - the resource location of the recipe crafted
    -   `ingredients` - an array of predicates for the item stacks used in the recipe
        -   A single item stack can only be used to fulfill one predicate
        -   Each predicate needs to be fulfilled to trigger the advancement. This allows for seperation between recipes that have same identifier but use different ingredients.
        -   This field is optional. When not provided, or left empty, only the `recipe_id` will dictate the success of the trigger

### Tags

-   Added `villager_plantable_seeds` to represent which kind of seeds Villagers can farm
-   Added `maintains_farmland` to represent which blocks will not cause farmland to be converted into dirt when placed on top of it

### Display entity

#### Rendering changes

-   `item_display` items have been rotated 180 degrees around Y axis to better match transformation applied when rendering items on armor stand head and in item frames
    -   For reference, order of transformations applied to model (starting from innermost) is `item_transform`, rotate Y 180, `transformation` field, entity orientation (billboard option + `Rotation` field + `Pos` field)

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w14a

We are now releasing Snapshot 23w14a, containing changes to Sculk blocks and Enchanting Tables, a new Quick Play functionality, an updated logo for Java Edition, a new main menu panorama, and lots of bug fixes!

Happy mining!

## Changes

-   Changes to Sculk blocks
-   Replaceable blocks no longer block the connection between Enchanting Tables and Bookshelves
-   In the Desert Temple, the new room has more of its roof collapsed and one block of Suspicious Sand is always visible in the top layer
-   Updated the Minecraft: Java Edition logo
-   The main menu background is now a Trails & Tales panorama

### Sculk Shrieker

-   Waterlogging them will now silence their shriek sounds
-   Added to the Redstone Blocks tab in the creative menu

### Sculk Sensor

-   For both normal and calibrated Sculk Sensors, the following changes have been made:
    -   Default redstone output has been modified to be more reliable for distance calculations
    -   Now strongly powers the block they are placed on

### Calibrated Sculk Sensor

-   Has an active cooldown of 1 second instead of 2 seconds
-   Detects vibrations up to 16 blocks away instead of 8 blocks
-   Accepts signals into the calibration input side more consistently with other Redstone components
    -   For example, signals can now be received through a block

## Technical Changes

-   Signs with click commands can now be interacted with even if the Sign is not waxed
    -   Signs with non-`text` chat components can no longer be edited
-   Added new loot table function called `reference`
-   Added support for Quick Play
-   Removed the `server` & `port` arguments as their functionality has been replaced by Quick Play
-   Changes to tags
-   The resource pack version is now 14
    -   Updated the sprite layout of `minecraft.png`
    -   Removed the overriding `minecraft.png` from the Programmer Art resource pack
    -   Updated the sprite layout of `invite_icon.png`

### Loot tables

#### `reference`

New function `reference` allows functions to call sub-functions (similar to `reference` condition). Fields:

-   `name` - location of function to call

### Quick Play

-   Added support for four new command line arguments that allow the game to be launched directly into a world
-   `quickPlayPath` takes a specified path for logging (relative to the run directory)
    -   If a path is provided the following will be logged upon joining a world:
        -   `type`: is either `singleplayer`, `multiplayer`, or `realms`
        -   `identifier`: represents the world you want to join
            -   For singleplayer, the folder name of the world
            -   For multiplayer, the IP address of the server
            -   For realms, the Realms ID
        -   `port`: represents the server port and is only logged for multiplayer
        -   `name`: The name of the world
        -   `gamemode`: The gamemode of the world
        -   `lastPlayedTime`: The time you joined the world
    -   Example:
        -   `--quickPlayPath "quickPlay/log.json"` will resolve into `.minecraft/quickPlay/log.json`
-   `quickPlaySingleplayer`, `quickPlayMultiplayer` and `quickPlayRealms` all take their respective `identifier`
    -   If one of these arguments is provided, the game will try to launch directly into the given world
    -   Examples:
        -   `--quickPlaySingleplayer "New World"`
        -   `--quickPlayMultiplayer "localhost:25565"`
        -   `--quickPlayRealms "1234"`

### Tags

-   Added `replaceable_by_trees`, to better express blocks that are replaced when the tree grows through them
-   Removed `replaceable_plants` since it was only used as a subset of the blocks for the tag above, and not as universally
-   Added `sword_efficient`, to represent blocks that are broken slightly faster by a sword than normal

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w12a

Well hello fellow Minecraft lovers! It is time for the first snapshot for 1.20. We know we promised no more major features, so how did we end up with such a big snapshot? You thought the trails were over? NO! In snapshot 23w12a we have even more tales to tell! Our devs apparently could not resist throwing in a few extra additions. Enjoy!

## New Features

-   All features and changes from the "Update 1.20" experimental pack are now part of the game
-   Vibration resonance functionality has been added to Blocks of Amethyst
-   Added the Calibrated Sculk Sensor block
-   Added Suspicious Gravel, more Archaeology sites, and new Pottery Shards
-   Added 5 new armor trims
-   Signs have improved customization options
-   Added Sniffer Egg
-   Added Pitcher Plant

### Vibration Resonance

-   Blocks of Amethyst have a new behavior when placed adjacent to Sculk Sensors
    -   If that Sculk Sensor receives a vibration, the Block of Amethyst will re-emit its frequency as a separate vibration at its location
-   This behaviour is called Vibration Resonance, and allows players to move vibration frequencies across long distances without having to recreate the vibration naturally

### Calibrated Sculk Sensors

-   A new variant of Sculk Sensors which allows you to filter vibrations based on their frequency level
-   They are not found naturally and can only be crafted with 1 Sculk Sensor and 3 Amethyst Shards in the Crafting Table
-   One side of the Calibrated Sculk Sensor can receive a redstone signal as input
    -   The strength of that redstone signal is the only vibration frequency the Sculk Sensor will listen to

### Archaeology

-   Added Suspicious Gravel block
    -   It has the same characteristics as Suspicious Sand
-   Added Suspicious Gravel to Cold Ocean Ruins
-   Added Suspicious Sand to Warm Ocean Ruins
    -   Sniffer Eggs can be found here
-   Added the Trail Ruins, a buried structure from a lost culture
    -   Four Armor trims can be found here
-   Added 16 Pottery Shards (so there are now 20 Pottery Shards in total)
    -   These have been distributed between the 5 Archaeology sites: Desert Wells, Desert Temples, Cold Ocean Ruins, Warm Ocean Ruins, and Trail Ruins

### Armor Trims

New armor trim Smithing Templates have been added to the following structures:

-   Trail Ruins
    -   Wayfinder Armor Trim
    -   Raiser Armor Trim
    -   Shaper Armor Trim
    -   Host Armor Trim
-   Ancient City
    -   Silence Armor Trim

### Signs

-   Sign text can now be edited after being placed in the world
    -   This can be done by interacting with the Sign
-   Both sides of the Sign can now have separate text and colors, allowing for further customization options
    -   By default, a Sign will prompt you to input the front side's text when placed
    -   To apply text to the back-side, you must walk to the other side and interact with that face to edit it
-   Signs can now also be waxed with Honeycomb, preventing any further edits to its text
    -   Click commands on Signs can only be invoked when the Sign is waxed
    -   If a Sign with a click command is not waxed, interacting with it will not invoke the command and instead open up the edit screen as usual

### Sniffer Egg

-   Can be found in the Suspicious Sand of Warm Ocean Ruins
-   When two Sniffers breed they do not immediately spawn a Snifflet; instead, a Sniffer Egg is dropped
-   Hatching
    -   When placed on Moss, the Egg will hatch after approximately 10 minutes
    -   On all other blocks, it will hatch in approximately 20 minutes

### Pitcher Plant

-   The Sniffer can now occasionally Sniff up a Pitcher Pod item
    -   This Pod, when planted in Farmland, grows into a Pitcher Crop, which has five growth stages
    -   Once fully grown, the Pitcher Crop can be harvested, yielding a two-block-tall Pitcher Plant

## Changes

-   Vibration frequencies of many actions in the game have been tweaked
-   Wither effect particle color has been adjusted to make it more distinguishable
-   Potion of Slow Falling color has been adjusted to make it more distinguishable
-   Step sounds can now combine for blocks walked through and stepped on

### Vibration Frequencies

In preparation for the Calibrated Sculk Sensor, vibration frequencies have been greatly simplified to prevent unwanted interference. The following are category descriptions for each frequency and the expected events that they correspond to:

1.  Movement in any medium (land, water and air)
2.  Landing on any surface (land or water)
3.  Item interactions
4.  Gliding with an elytra or unique mob actions (Ravager roar, Wolf shaking, etc)
5.  Dismounting a mob or equipping gear
6.  Mounting a mob or interacting with a mob
7.  Mobs and players getting damaged
8.  Consuming items (drinking and eating)
9.  Blocks 'deactivating' (door close, chest close, button unpress, etc)
10.  Blocks 'activating' (door open, chest open, button press, etc)
11.  Blocks changing (cauldron water level rising, adding food to campfire, etc)
12.  Blocks being destroyed
13.  Blocks being placed
14.  Mobs and players teleporting or spawning
15.  Mobs and players dying or an explosion

### Combination Step Sounds

-   Combines two different step sounds
-   Occurs for carpets, snow, nether sprouts, as well as warped and crimson roots
    -   The top-most block you are walking on is played as normal
    -   The block underneath is played at a lower volume and pitch

### Armor Trims

-   The Dune Armor Trim now has a brand-new pattern and Smithing Template icon
-   The Dune Armor Trim's old pattern is now used by the Sentry Armor Trim
    -   A new icon has been made for the Sentry Armor Trim Smithing Template to fit this pattern
-   The Sentry Armor Trim's old pattern is now used by the new Shaper Armor Trim

## Technical Changes

-   The data pack version is now 13, accounting for sign data format changes
-   Added a `capped` rule structure processor that limits the number of replaced blocks for a structure piece to a configured maximum
-   Configuring block entity fields in a `rule` processor rule is now delegated to a referenced `block_entity_modifier` instead of the previously fixed `output_nbt` configuration
-   Game events have changed vibration frequency and some have been removed
-   Tweaked display entity interpolation
-   Removed `update_1_20` feature flag and built-in datapack - features are no longer experimental

### Structure post-processors

#### Capped post-processor

-   A `capped` post-processor has been added which can limit how many blocks a delegated post-processor randomly transform in a structure
-   This can be used to configure a structure piece to have an exact amount of specific blocks, instead of using random distribution
-   The `capped` post-processor has following required parameters:
    -   `delegate` A post-processor which performs the actual block transformation
    -   `limit` Maximum amount of blocks that the delegated post-processor can transform
        -   The blocks inside a structure are all randomly passed to the delegated post-processor until it has transformed the limited amount
        -   Either constant or random number generator sampled during post-processing

#### Rule post-processor block entity configuration

-   Previously a rule could specify an optional fixed `output_nbt` which would be added to the processed output block entity
-   This field has now been changed to reference a `block_entity_modifier`
-   Existing `block_entity_modifier`'s are:
    -   `passthrough` Retains existing fields on the block entity
        -   This is the default if no `block_entity_modifier` is specified
    -   `append_static` Similar to previous `output_nbt` this provides fixed fields to add to the block entity
        -   A minor change is that this modifier appends configured fields to the processed block instead of replacing existing fields
    -   `clear` Removes any existing fields on the block entity
    -   `append_loot` Appends a loot table and seed to the block entity through required parameter:
        -   `loot_table` Referenced loot table to add to block entity as `LootTable` field
        -   Field `LootTableSeed` is also added to the block entity using random seeded by block position

### Game Events

-   `piston_contract` game event has been removed in favor of `block_deactivate`
-   `piston_extend` and `dispense_fail` game events have been removed in favor of `block_activate`
-   Many game events have new vibration frequencies:
    -   1: `step`, `swim`, `flap`
    -   2: `projectile_land`, `hit_ground`, `splash`
    -   3: `item_interact_finish`, `projectile_shoot`, `instrument_play`
    -   4: `entity_roar`, `entity_shake`, `elytra_glide`
    -   5: `entity_dismount`, `equip`
    -   6: `entity_mount`, `entity_interact`, `shear`
    -   7: `entity_damage`
    -   8: `drink`, `eat`
    -   9: `container_close`, `block_close`, `block_deactivate`, `block_detach`
    -   10: `container_open`, `block_open`, `block_activate`, `block_attach`, `prime_fuse`, `note_block_play`
    -   11: `block_change`
    -   12: `block_destroy`, `fluid_pickup`
    -   13: `block_place`, `fluid_place`
    -   14: `entity_place`, `lightning_strike`, `teleport`
    -   15: `entity_die`, `explode`

### Tags

#### Step Sounds

-   The blocks that can produce a combination of step sounds is controlled by `combination_step_sound_blocks`

### Display entity

#### Interpolation changes

-   Previous values are always discarded if `interpolation_duration` is `0`
-   Made sure that render properties are applied at the same time (so `block_state` is applied at the same time as transformation, i.e. at next tick after receiving update)
-   Entities are not rendered unless initial data is received. That means display entities might not show on the first tick.
-   Note: due to how game handles updates, changes to entities made after summoning might be delivered to clients with later tick

# Minecraft 1.19.4 Release Candidate 1

Here is the first (and hopefully last) release candidate for 1.19.4. Unless something critical pops up, no further changes will be made for the full release, which is planned for next week.

Happy mining!

## Technical Changes

Changes to display entity interpolation:

-   interpolation always starts at the beginning on client tick
-   field `interpolation_start` is replaced with `start_interpolation`, with a different meaning
-   `start_interpolation` describes amount of ticks from the start of next client tick after receiving an update to start of interpolation
    -   for example value `0` means that interpolation will start at the beginning of next client tick after receiving the update
-   `start_interpolation` is not stored in entity data
    -   when using data commands, if interpolated value is updated, but `start_interpolation` is not present in modified tag, interpolation will continue from the time of previous update, but with new values

## Fixed bugs in 1.19.4-rc1

-   [MC-260857](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-260857) Display entities summoned with initial transformation interpolate incorrectly from default transformation during next transformation

# Minecraft 1.19.4 Pre-Release 1

We are now releasing the first pre-release for Minecraft 1.19.4. This pre-release contains a new high contrast accessibility setting, some updates to the Create World tab visuals, a new execute subcommand, improvements to startup performance, and lots of bug fixes!

For the remainder of the 1.19.4 cycle, you should mostly see bugs being fixed. In addition to that, pre-releases don't follow the regular snapshot cadence of releasing on Wednesdays, so keep an eye out for the next pre-release.

Happy mining!

## Important Note

-   Experimental 1.20 worlds created in the previous snapshot (23w07a) can no longer be opened in this version

## Changes

-   The enchantment glint for items in the inventory has been made more visible
-   The default value of the "Glint Strength" setting has been reduced to 75%
-   Potions no longer have an enchantment glint due to it obscuring the color of the potion contents
-   Added a notification system for Realms to tell you about important information about your Realm

### Accessibility

-   Added a built-in resource pack that enhances the contrast of UI elements
    -   The resource pack can be enabled in the Accessibility Options screen or manually in the Resource Pack screen
    -   This is only available in the menus for now, but we’ll be looking to bring this to gameplay UIs in the future as well

### Updated Create New World Screen

-   The appearance of the tab bar in the Create New World screen has been updated
    -   Tabs now have unique visuals instead of being traditional buttons
    -   The tabs now align to the center of the screen
    -   The content has been aligned to the top of the screen

## Technical Changes

-   The resource pack version is now 13
-   Changed the following game events:
    -   `item_interact_finish` now has a vibration frequency of 2 instead of 14
-   New Damage Type Tag: `bypasses_cooldown` - damage types with this tag bypass the regular invincibility time after taking damage
-   New Entity Type Tag: `fall_damage_immune` - entity types with this tag do not take fall damage

### Resource Pack format

-   The enchantment glint now has two separate texture files: `enchanted_glint_entity.png` and `enchanted_glint_item.png`

### Commands

##### `execute positioned over`

New `execute` sub-command for finding positions on top of a heightmap. Changes the height of the execution position to be on top of the given heightmap. Syntax:

-   `execute positioned over <heightmap>`

###### Heightmaps

A heightmap records the highest position in a column of blocks according to some criteria. Available options:

-   `world_surface`: Any non-air block
-   `motion_blocking`: Any motion blocking material (e.g. ignores flowers and grass)
-   `motion_blocking_no_leaves`: Any non-leaf motion blocking material
-   `ocean_floor`: Any non-fluid motion blocking material

## Changes for Experimental Features

-   The Brush crafting recipe now uses a Feather, Copper Ingot and Stick in a vertical line
-   The Sniffer Spawn Egg colors have been updated
-   The recipe for the Decorated Pot made of all Bricks can now be found in the Recipe Book

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w07a

This week we're bringing you the Sniffer, Archaeology, and the Cherry Blossom biome as experimental features for the 1.20 update.

Changes for the 1.19.4 release include Interaction Entities, and updates to jukeboxes and horse breeding.

Happy brushing!

## Changes

-   Jukeboxes have changed to be at parity with Bedrock
-   Horse breeding has been updated
-   Updated the Realms screen to be more in line with the Singleplayer and Multiplayer screens

### Recipe unlocking

-   The Crafting Table recipe is unlocked immediately on creating a new world
-   The Crossbow recipe is no longer unlocked by sticks
-   The Soul Campfire recipe is no longer unlocked by sticks

### Jukebox

-   While playing a music disc, it will emit a redstone signal of 15
-   Droppers and hoppers can now interact with it

### Horses

-   When breeding horses and the like, the babies' speed, jump height and health are no longer biased toward the average
-   This change is intended to make horse breeding a viable way of getting great horses, if a player starts with good parents and puts in enough time and Golden Carrots

## Technical Changes

-   The vanilla resource pack en\_us language file is now sorted alphanumerically by key
-   A new recipe serializer `crafting_decorated_pot` has been added for the new Decorated Pot recipe
-   Added `show_notification` field to recipes
    -   Accepts a boolean which determines if a notification is shown when unlocking this recipe
    -   defaults to `true` if isn't specified

### Interaction Entities

A new type of entity that records attacks ("left clicks") and interactions ("right clicks"). Interactions are invisible and of a custom size.

Fields:

-   `width`: Width of the entity's bounding box (default `1`)
-   `height`: Height of the entity's bounding box (default `1`)
-   `attack`: Records the last attack action on the entity
-   `interaction`: Records the last interaction action on the entity
-   `response`: Boolean specifying if interacting should trigger a response (arm swing, sound effects, etc - default `false`)

#### Action Format

When an action is stored, it always has two fields:

-   `player`: The UUID (in standard integer array format) of the player performing the action
-   `timestamp`: The timestamp of the game tick when the event happened (stored as a long)

#### Advancement Triggers

-   Interacting with an Interaction entity triggers `player_interacted_with_entity`
-   Attacking an Interaction entity triggers `player_hurt_entity`

#### `execute on` with Interactions

The Interaction entity targets the player who last interacted with it. That makes the following possible:

-   `execute on attacker`: execute as the last player who attacked the entity
-   `execute on target`: execute as the last player who interacted with the entity

## Experimental Features

-   Added Sniffer mob
-   Added a Cherry Grove biome
-   Added Archaeology

### Sniffer

-   Sniffer Mob now available as an experimental feature
    -   The Sniffer is the mob vote winner of Minecraft Live 2022 and the first "ancient" mob added to the game
    -   Sniffers cannot be tempted or tamed
    -   Sniffers are passive friendly mobs
    -   Sniffers sniff in the air and occasionally dig for seeds
-   Torchflower now available as an experimental feature
    -   The Torchflower seed can be planted on farmland and grows into a flower
    -   The seed can be used to breed two Sniffers
    -   The full-grown flower can be harvested and replanted but can also be crafted into a dye

### Cherry Grove biome

-   Added a new Cherry Grove biome, with pretty cherry blossom trees
-   You can find it in the mountains, like Meadows

#### Pink Petals block

-   Added a new Pink Petals block with lots of pink flowers on the ground

#### Cherry Wood Set

-   Added a new Cherry wood set, with all the corresponding wooden things you can make from it. You need to have the Update 1.20 experimental features enabled to see it in game.

### Archaeology

#### The brush

-   The brush is a craftable item you can use to brush things

#### Suspicious Sand

-   Desert Temples and Desert Wells now contain Suspicious Sand. This fragile block is hard to spot and easy to destroy, so be careful!
-   Brushing the Suspicious Sand with a Brush will extract objects that were buried long ago

#### Pottery Shards

-   Pottery Shards have pictures on them
-   They cannot be crafted and are only found by brushing Suspicious Sand

#### Decorated Pots

-   Crafting four Pottery Shards together will create a Decorated Pot with a picture on each side
-   You can also use Brick items instead of Pottery Shards in the Decorated Pot recipe
    -   The sides that were made from Brick items will not have pictures
-   Smash a Decorated Pot with any block-breaking tool to break it apart and get the Pottery Shards back
    -   Or hit it with your fist to pick up the pot without breaking it

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w06a

Today we are bringing you the `damage` command and new display entities.

Damage safely!

## Changes

-   Jukeboxes now emit a note particle above them while playing a music disc to match Bedrock

### Accessibility

-   Added a new option in the Accessibility menu called Damage Tilt for controlling the amount of camera shake when being hurt
-   Added a tooltip in the Key Binds screen that specifies which keybinds are conflicting
-   "Notification Display Time" accessibility option was renamed to "Notification Time"

### Updated Create New World Screen

-   Tabs can be switched with the keyboard by pressing Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab
-   Specific tabs can also be navigated to by pressing Ctrl+Tab Number
    -   For example, Ctrl+2 navigates to the second tab
-   Added a screen to easily enable/disable experimental features
    -   The screen can always be found under the More-tab
    -   In snapshots a shortcut button can be found under the Game-tab

### Creative menu

-   Added painting variants to creative menu
-   Paintings with pre-defined variant will now display author and title in description when hovered over

## Technical Changes

-   Added display entities for flexible display of items, blocks and text
-   Added a `damage` command for applying damage to entities
-   Added `--pidFile` argument to dedicated server command line for printing process id to file
-   Added the following game events:
    -   `entity_dismount` with a vibration frequency of 6
    -   `entity_mount` with a vibration frequency of 7
-   Added a group of entities to display items, blocks and text
-   Added `execute summon` to allow customization of a newly spawned entity

### Display entities

Three new entities have been added for flexible display of items, blocks and text

-   Those entities, similarily to `marker`, don't tick and have no collisions or physics
-   Models render at entity position, with normal rotation around X and Y axis (so it can be controlled by teleport commands), but also with additional arbitrary model transform

#### Common data types

Tag contents for those entities include some new data types with complex structure. Any form can be used for modifying data, but only one form is used for saving.

##### `rotation`

-   Quaternion form (used for saving): array of 4 numbers, describing components (x, y, z, w)
-   Axis-angle form: object with following fields:
    -   `axis` - 3d vector
    -   `angle` - in radians

#### `transformation`

Arbitrary affine transform

-   Matrix form: array of 16 numbers, describing row-major matrix
-   Decomposed form (used for saving): object with following fields:
    -   `translation` - 3d vector
    -   `left_rotation`, `right_rotation` - `rotation`
    -   `scale` - 3d vector
    -   Transforms are composed in order `translation`, `left_rotation`, `scale`, `right_rotation`

#### Interpolation

Some properties of display entites can be interpolated. That means that clients will see gradual changes over time instead of instantenous jumps.

Display entities keep track of current and previous values of interpolated values:

-   All properties marked as "interpolated" are part of a single interpolation set
-   Any update to interpolated property will cause all values of interpolation set to be saved as "current"
    -   Data command executions that do not change value of property (even if it's present in NBT) do not count as updates
    -   Updates are synchronized to clients at most once per tick, so multiple updates within command will still count as single update
-   Previous current values are saved as "previous"
-   If interpolation is enabled, entity will transition between "previous" and "current" values over time
-   Start of interpolation (entity fully in "previous" state) is defined by field `interpolation_start` (game time, in ticks)
    -   Set to `-1` to load current game time instead)
-   End of interpolation (entity fully in "current" state) is defined as `interpolation_start` + `interpolation_duration` (in ticks)

#### Common properties

Every entity in family has the following fields:

-   `transformation` - `transformation` applied to model (after normal entity orientation). Defaults to identity. Interpolated
-   `billboard` - option to control if entity should pivot to face player when rendered:
    -   `fixed` - no rotation (default)
    -   `vertical` - entity can pivot around vertical axis
    -   `horizontal` - entity can pivot around horizontal axis
    -   `center` - entity can pivot around center point
-   `brightness` - if present, overrides light values used for rendering. Omited by default (which means rendering uses values from entity position). Object has two fields:
    -   `sky` - value of skylight, 0..15
    -   `block` - value of block light, 0..15
-   `view_range` - maximum view range of this entity. Actual distance depends on client-side render distance and entity distance scalling. Default value 1.0 (roughly the same as fireball)
-   `shadow_radius` - size of shadow. Defaults to 0 (no shadow). Interpolated
-   `shadow_strength` - strength of the shadow. Controls the opacity of the shadow as a function of distance to block below. Defaults to 1. Interpolated
-   `width`, `height` - describe size of culling bounding box. Bounding box spans vertically `y` to `y+height` and horizontally `width/2` in all directions from entity position. If either field is set to 0, culling is disabled. Both default to 0
-   `glow_color_override` - override glow border color. Defaults to 0 (use team color)

#### `item_display`

Displays a single item stack.

-   Stack can be changed with commands by setting slot `inventory.0`

Fields:

-   `item` - item stack to display. Same format as in inventory (example: `{id: "minecraft:dirt", Count: 1}`)
-   `item_display` - describes item model transform applied to item (as defined in `display` section in model JSON)
    -   Values: `none` (default), `thirdperson_lefthand`, `thirdperson_righthand`, `firstperson_lefthand`, `firstperson_righthand`, `head`, `gui`, `ground`, `fixed`

#### `block_display`

Displays a block state.

-   Does not display block entities, even if they would normally be created on block placement (like chest)

Fields:

-   `block_state` - block state to display. Same format as item held by endermen (example `{Name:"minecraft:dirt"}`)

#### `text_display`

Displays a text component.

Fields:

-   `text` - text to display. Components are resolved with the context of the display entity
-   `line_width` - line width used to split lines (note: new line can be also addded with `\n` characters). Defaults to 200
-   `text_opacity` - opacity (alpha component) of rendered text. Defaults to 255. Interpolated
-   `background` - color of background. Includes alpha channel. Defaults to 0x40000000. Interpolated
-   `default_background` - if true, rendering uses default text background color (same as in chat). Defaults to false
-   `shadow` - should text be displayed with shadow. Defaults to false
-   `see_through` - should text be visible through blocks. Defaults to false
-   `alignment` - how text should be aligned
    -   Values: `center` (default), `left`, `right`

Note: text display backgrounds uses new shader types `rendertype_text_background` and `rendertype_text_background_see_through`

### Damage Types

Damage Types are a new registry that can be extended through data packs. A Damage Type determines how damage is handled by the game. This includes which attributes the damage has as well as which death message is used when an entity dies due to that type of damage.

Example:

    {
      "exhaustion": 0.1,
      "message_id": "arrow",
      "scaling": "when_caused_by_living_non_player"
    }
    

Fields:

-   `message_id`: The message id used for deaths caused by this damage type
    -   Will be combined with other string fragments to form a translation key
-   `exhaustion`: The amount of hunger exhaustion caused by this damage type
-   `scaling`: Whether this damage type scales with difficulty levels. Possible values:
    -   `never`: Damage is always the same
    -   `always`: Damage always scales with difficulty
    -   `when_caused_by_living_non_player`: Damage scales with difficulty if it was caused by a living entity who is not a player
-   `effects`: Optional field controlling how damage manifests when inflicted on players. Possible values:
    -   `hurt` (default): the default hurt sound
    -   `thorns`: Thorns hurt sound
    -   `drowning`: Drowning sound
    -   `burning`: A single tick of burning sound
    -   `poking`: Berry bush poke sound
    -   `freezing`: Freeze tick sound
-   `death_message_type`: Optional field that controls if special death message variants are used. Possible values:
    -   `default` (default): No special death message logic is applied
    -   `fall_variants`: Show a variant of fall damage death instead of a regular death message, e.g. `death.fell.assist.item`
    -   `intentional_game_design`: Show the intentional game design message instead of a regular death message

Damage type tags control many aspects of how damage from different sources are interpreted.

### Commands

#### `damage`

New command to apply damage to entities.

Syntax:

-   `damage <target> <amount> [<damageType>] [at <location>]`
-   `damage <target> <amount> [<damageType>] [by <entity>] [from <cause>]`

Parameters:

-   `target`: The entity to damage
-   `amount`: Amount of damage to inflict
-   `damageType`: The type of damage to inflict
    -   This determines how the damage affects the entity as well as which death message is displayed
-   `entity`: The entity inflicting the damage
-   `cause`: The cause of the damage, in the case of indirect damage
    -   Example: When shot by an arrow, the `entity` is the Arrow projectile while `cause` might be a Skeleton
-   `location`: The location the damage originated at (when no entity caused the damage)
    -   For instance, `location` might represent the location of a Bed exploding in the Nether

#### `execute summon`

New `execute` sub-command for summoning new entity and binding context (`@s`) to it. Meant to simplify entity setup and reduce need for raw NBT editing.

-   `execute summon <entity id>`

### Predicates

#### Damage Type Predicates

The following fields have been removed from damage type predicates: `is_projectile`, `is_explosion`, `bypasses_armor`, `bypasses_invulnerability`, `bypasses_magic`, `is_fire`, `is_magic`, `is_lightning`.

A new `tags` array has been added. Each entry has two fields:

-   `id`: The ID of a damage type tag
-   `expected`: Whether the damage is expected to have or not have the tag for the predicate to match

### Game Rules

-   Added `doVinesSpread` game rule, determining if vines will spread to nearby blocks
    -   Defaults to `true`

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w05a

In this snapshot we've tweaked the armor trim feature and redefined the Create New World user experience flow.

Happy world creating!

## Changes

-   Updated the Create New World screen
-   Interacting with armor or elytra items in-hand will now swap them with equipped gear
-   The enchantment glint has been further tweaked to be slower and less visible, but also have more contrast in some intervals

### Accessibility

-   Changed how tooltips in the menu UI are positioned so buttons are still readable
-   Added two new options in the Accessibility menu for adjusting the speed and transparency of enchantment glints

### Updated Create New World Screen

-   The screen is now organized into three tabs
    -   The Game-Tab allows to set the world name, Gamemode, Difficultly and whether to allow cheats
    -   The World-Tab allows to set the World-Type and Seed, and to toggle the generation of structures and the bonus chest
    -   The More-Tab provides access to the Game Rules and DataPack Selection Screen
-   Removed the Import Settings button and the corresponding Export Settings button in the Edit World Screen

## Technical Changes

### Trim Patterns & Materials

-   The following data is now also defined by a trim material:
    -   `override_armor_materials` which is an optional map of armor material to overriden color palette
        -   Map key is the armor material that this trim material wants to override with a different color palette
        -   Map value is the name of the color palette that will be used when this trim material is applied to an armor piece with the corresponding armor material
-   The following data is no longer defined by a trim material:
    -   `incompatible_armor_material`

### Commands

#### `effect`

-   `infinite` is now a valid option for effect durations
    -   Infinite effect durations show up as "∞" in the player inventory view

## Experimental Features

-   Armor trims can now be applied to leather armor
-   Armor can now have trims of the same material it is made out of
    -   For example, a Golden Chestplate with a Golden Armor Trim is now possible
-   The texture of the Dune armor trim has been tweaked so that the symbol on the chestplate is moved up a few pixels
-   Loot tables for smithing templates have been adjusted

### Loot tables for smithing templates

-   The following common armor trims now always generate 2 templates in a chest when found:
    -   Dune
    -   Coast
    -   Wild
    -   Sentry
-   This is to give new players a chance to understand that smithing templates are consumed when used
-   Netherite Upgrade smithing templates have been made twice as common
    -   While we do want Netherite upgrading to be more challenging, we felt the previous rates did not encourage further exploration after finding the first Netherite Upgrade template
-   1 Eye Armor Trim is now guaranteed in every Stronghold library chest
    -   This is so even in the most unlucky worlds, this armor trim can still be found
-   Woodland Mansions now have a greatly increased chance of generating the Vex Armor Trim smithing template
    -   Woodland Mansions already have very few chests that utilize loot tables - in unlucky generations, none at all. It was too rare to find one of these trims, and we want the challenge of getting the Vex Armor Trim to be more about finding a Woodland Mansion to begin with
-   Across the board, smithing templates have been made slightly more common
    -   Due to the method of crafting copies of templates, we want the process of discovering another template in a structure to feel like the player has just saved 7 diamonds. If the templates are too rare, this situation does not happen as much, meaning players will not be encouraged to explore more structures

## Fixed bugs in Snapshot 23w05a

-   [MC-127749](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-127749) Cape is jittering; movement way sharper than in snapshot 18w03b
-   [MC-147711](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-147711) Drowned no longer have a different swimming animation

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w04a

Tuesday is the new Wednesday, did you know? Here is snapshot 23w04a with a new experimental Armor Trim Smithing feature in the Update\_1\_20 experimental pack.

Happy trimming!

## Changes

-   Enchantment glint on items and armor is now more subtle

## Experimental Features

-   Added a new armor trimming system to visually customize your armor
-   Added Smithing Template items
-   Redesigned the Smithing Table
-   Changed how Netherite equipment is crafted

### Smithing Templates

-   Smithing Tables have been redesigned into a workstation for physical equipment upgrades and modifications
-   Alongside slots for combining a piece of equipment and materials, there is now a required slot for an item type called Smithing Templates
-   Smithing Templates define what type of upgrade you will be making to equipment
    -   It specifies both what type of items you can upgrade, and which ingredients are valid to customize the upgrade
    -   There are currently two categories of Smithing Templates: Armor Trim and Netherite Upgrade
-   Smithing Templates are consumed when used to upgrade an item in the Smithing Table
-   You can craft a copy of a Smithing Template in the Crafting Table with 7 diamonds + 1 block of material that the template is made out of + 1 smithing template, which will output 2 of the same Smithing Template

### Netherite Equipment

-   Netherite equipment crafting now also requires a Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template
-   Netherite Upgrade Smithing Templates can be found randomly in all Bastion Remnant chests, and there is a guarantee of 2 in every Treasure Room Bastion Remnant
-   This change was made for a variety of reasons:
    -   Increase the time players utilize Diamond equipment before Netherite
    -   Make Netherite equipment a more significant achievement in the game's progression
    -   Adapt Netherite more naturally into the new Smithing Table crafting system

### Armor Trims

-   You can now visually customize your armor with a variety of unique trims at the Smithing Table
    -   All armor is viable for trims except for leather armor
-   Armor trims are purely visual with no gameplay benefits, and can only be applied to Helmets, Chestplates, Leggings and Boots
    -   All trim patterns are visually the same on an armor's item icon, but the color will still change based on the trim material
    -   To check which trim pattern a piece of armor has, you can hover over it in the inventory
-   Armor Trim Smithing Templates can be found all throughout the world, and each of the following structures contain their own unique Smithing Template:
    -   Pillager Outpost
        -   Sentry Armor Trim
    -   Desert Pyramid
        -   Dune Armor Trim
    -   Shipwreck
        -   Coast Armor Trim
    -   Jungle Temple
        -   Wild Armor Trim
    -   Ocean Monument
        -   Tide Armor Trim
    -   Ancient City
        -   Ward Armor Trim
    -   Woodland Mansion
        -   Vex Armor Trim
    -   Nether Fortress
        -   Rib Armor Trim
    -   Bastion Remnant
        -   Snout Armor Trim
    -   Stronghold
        -   Eye Armor Trim
    -   End City
        -   Spire Armor Trim
-   Smithing Templates are found in chests in their respective structure, except for the Ocean Monument. Instead of finding it in chests, Elder Guardians sometimes drop a Smithing Template upon death
-   Some Armor Trim Smithing Templates are rarer than others, so be on the lookout for them to impress your friends!
-   An armor trim has two properties: a pattern and a material
    -   The pattern is defined by the Smithing Template used to apply the trim, and represents the visual pattern of the trim
    -   The material is defined by what ingredient you used to apply the trim, and represents the color of the trim
-   The viable ingredients you can use to define the color of your armor trim are the following:
    -   Iron
    -   Copper
    -   Gold
    -   Lapis
    -   Emerald
    -   Diamond
    -   Netherite
    -   Redstone
    -   Amethyst
    -   Quartz
-   Armor cannot have the same material it is made of applied to it as a trim
    -   For example, a Golden Chestplate cannot have a Golden Armor Trim

## Technical Changes

-   Added a new type of atlas configuration source: `paletted_permutations`
    
-   Armor Stands now preserve custom names when placed and broken
    
-   A new registry `trim_pattern` has been added for the armor trim system
    
-   A new recipe serializer `smithing_transform` has been added for the updated Netherite Upgrade recipe
    
-   A new recipe serializer `smithing_trim` has been added for the new Armor Trim recipe
    
-   Smithing table has temporarily two menu types
    
    -   Old menu without Smithing Template slot has been renamed to `legacy_smithing`
        -   Will be removed when Armor Trim feature stops being an experimental feature
    -   New menu with Smithing Template slot was added called `smithing`
-   Added new flag (value 128) to `HideFlags` NBT field for hiding armor trim item tooltips
    

### Paletted Permutations

-   `paletted_permutations` is a new type of atlas configuration source used to dynamically generate new textures in memory based on a set of color palettes
-   Color palettes allow you to swap out the colors of a texture without having to supply all files for the variants of a texture in a resource pack
-   This is useful for things like armor trims, where you want to be able to change the color of parts of the armor without having to create a new texture for each color
-   The `paletted_permutations` source has a set of required parameters:
    -   `textures` A list of namespaced locations of base textures
        -   These textures will be used to generate variants of them that have been modified by color palettes
    -   `palette_key` A namespaced location of a color palette key file
        -   A color palette key is used to define the set of key pixel colors we want to swap out with the color palettes defined below
    -   `permutations` A map of permutations from suffix to a namespaced location of a color palette file
        -   The suffix is appended at the beginning to the resource location of the output variant textures, with a `_` character separating the suffix and the base texture name
        -   The color palette is a texture file with a set of pixels that are used for replacing pixels that match the color palette key in each base texture
        -   The number of pixels in each color palette must be the same as that of the `palette_key` defined for this source
        -   Key matching is done by comparing the RGB values of each pixel in the `palette_key` to the RGB values of each pixel in the color palette
        -   Alpha channel is ignored for key matching, but in the resulting texture the alpha channel is multiplied with the color palette's alpha channel
        -   Pixels that do not match the `palette_key` are copied over to the resulting texture as-is
-   After defining a `paletted_permutations` source, you can then reference those namespaced output textures in other resources in your resource pack
    -   For example, if you have the following `paletted_permutations` source:
        
            {
                "type": "paletted_permutations",
                "textures": [
                    "minecraft:item/leather_helmet",
                    "minecraft:item/leather_chestplate",
                    "minecraft:item/leather_leggings",
                    "minecraft:item/leather_boots"
                ],
                "palette_key": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/leather_armor_color_key",
                "permutations": {
                    "red": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/red",
                    "green": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/green",
                    "blue": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/blue"
                }
            }
            
        
    -   You can then reference the resulting textures in other resources like this:
        
            {
                "textures": {
                    "layer0": "minecraft:item/leather_helmet_red",
                    "layer1": "minecraft:item/leather_chestplate_green",
                    "layer2": "minecraft:item/leather_boots_blue"
                }
            }
            
        

### Trim Patterns & Materials

-   Trim patterns and materials for armor are defined by the server through the `trim_pattern` and `trim_material` registry respectively
    -   As a result, new trim patterns and materials can be added via data packs
-   These are synchronized to clients when they join the server
    -   However, clients must have an accompanying resource pack to see those registered trim patterns and materials
    -   The paths to these textures are inferred based on the filename of the pattern json, and will try to find the textures within the same namespace as the trim pattern's `name` field
-   The following data is defined by a trim pattern:
    -   `asset_id` which is a namespaced id used to infer texture locations and localization
    -   `template_item` which is the id of the smithing template item used to apply the trim pattern
    -   `description` which is a text component used for displaying the pattern name of an armor trim when hovering an armor itemstack
-   The following data is defined by a trim material:
    -   `asset_name` which is a string used as a suffix for armor trim texture locations
    -   `ingredient` which is the id of the ingredient item used to apply the trim material
    -   `item_model_index` which is a float which defines the item model override each armor item model should target to change their visuals for this material
    -   `incompatible_armor_material` which is an optional id of the armor material this trim material cannot be applied to
    -   `description` which is a text component used for displaying the material name of an armor trim when hovering an armor itemstack
        -   The style defined in this description is applied to the armor trim pattern `description` as well

### Commands

-   New relation available for `execute on`: `origin`:
    -   shooter, if the executing entity is a projectile (like arrow, fireball, trident, firework, thrown potion, etc.)
    -   thrower, if the executing entity is an item
    -   source of effect, if the executing entity is an area effect cloud
    -   igniter, if the executing entity is a primed tnt
    -   summoner, if the executing entity is evoker fangs or a vex

## Fixed bugs in 23w04a

Parameters:

-   `sourceDimension`: id of dimension to clone from
-   `targetDimension`: id of dimension to clone to

#### `data`

New source available:

-   `string <entity|block|storage> [path] [start] [end]` - reads a value as text, resulting in a string value

New arguments:

-   `start`: Index of first character to include at the start of the string

-   `dimension`: A dimension id

##### `execute on`

New `execute` sub-command for selecting entities based on relation to the current executing entity:

-   `execute on <relation>`

Relations:

-   `vehicle` - entity that the executing entity is riding
-   `passengers` - all entities directly riding the executing entity (no sub-passengers)

#### `ride`

New command to allow entities to start or stop riding other entities

Syntax:

-   `ride <target> mount <vehicle>`
    -   Makes a single target mount a single vehicle
    -   The command will fail if:
        -   `vehicle` is a player
        -   `target` is already riding a vehicle
        -   `target` and `vehicle` are the same entity
        -   `vehicle` is already a passenger (direct or indirect) of `target`
-   `ride <target> dismount`
    -   Dismounts `target` from any vehicle it is riding
    -   Fails if `target` is not riding anything

### Game Rules

# Minecraft Snapshot 22w46a

We are now releasing snapshot 22w46a for Minecraft 1.19.3 with [playable mob sounds](https://www.minecraft.net/article/playable-mob-sounds-coming-minecraft-1-20) added as an experimental feature, improvements for telemetry data and several technical improvements.

Happy mining!

## New Experimental Features in 22w46a

-   Books in Chiseled Bookshelf can be added or removed from any slot by targeting the specific slot

### Mob Heads on Note Blocks interaction

-   When placing a Mob Head on a Note Block, that Note Block will now play one of the ambient sounds of that mob when played by a player or powered by Redstone

### Piglin Mob Head

-   Piglins will now drop their heads when killed by a charged Creeper
-   Placing the Piglin head on a Note Block will play one of the Piglin's ambient sounds
-   The Piglin head will flap its ears when powered by Redstone, or when worn by a player while walking

## Changes in 22w46a

-   In the Nether dimension Endermen, Skeletons and Wither Skeletons now only spawn at light level 7 and below (instead of 11 and below)
    -   This is intended to nerf certain portal-based mob farms
    -   We welcome feedback on this
-   Added new top textures for Block of Bamboo and Block of Stripped Bamboo
-   Bamboo Plank texture has been tweaked to match the same tiling pattern as other plank variants

### Creative Inventory changes

-   Reordered Redstone tab based on feedback
-   Added Rails to the Tools & Utilities tab next to Minecarts

## Technical Changes in 22w46a

-   Blocks carried by Endermen now use loot tables to generate drops when killed
-   Changes to texture loading and stitching
-   Translation files and `pack.mcmeta` are now including non-ASCII characters (encoded as UTF-8) directly instead of using escape sequences
-   Added new Telemetry Events

### Telemetry

This release includes the WorldUnloaded event, a required event, as well as several opt-in events. Diagnostic tracking is a tool that helps us understand what you like about Minecraft, which allows us to make those things better.

The reason that WorldUnloaded, along with [WorldLoaded](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-21w38a), is a required event is that the information we’re looking at is, well, required. As a part of Xbox, we all need to follow a standard of practice, you can find a detailed description of it [here](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement). The parameters for what data we consider to be critical to our work are set by our team at Mojang Studios in alignment with Xbox.

What we want to find out is how fun you think Minecraft is. There are lots of ways to figure that out, like feedback, playtests, experience, and magic. We want to add data to that mix, which is where WorldLoaded and WorldUnloaded come in. WorldLoaded measures when you boot a session up, and WorldUnloaded measures when you shut it down. Together, they will measure how fun Minecraft is, using metrics such as playtime and the game modes that players choose to play. That’s it. All the data we collect, whether it’s required or opt-in, follows GDPR and CCPA best practices to keep your information safe.

The rest of the current telemetry events are opt-in, which means that you can choose whether or not you want to send us additional data. The only players that can’t opt-in are Microsoft child accounts, but everyone can still send in all of their feedback to [feedback.minecraft.net](http://feedback.minecraft.net/).

Just like all the thoughts and comments we get from you on our feedback site, this is something that greatly helps us improve Minecraft. We want to make a game that you want to play, so we want to know what that game needs. Even if it’s more lava.

#### Telemetry transparency

-   Added Telemetry Data Collection Screen
    -   This screen displays information about the type of data that is sent
    -   The level of data sent can be controlled between "Minimal" and "All"
        -   "Minimal" sends only the required data
        -   "All" sends the required data, as well as optional data
    -   The default data level is "Minimal" (only the required data)
-   Every telemetry event sent from the client is now logged to disk
    -   Old log files are removed after 7 days
    -   These can be found under the `logs/telemetry` directory
        -   A shortcut to this directory is available via the "Open My Data" button on the Telemetry Data Collection screen

#### Required telemetry events

-   Added WorldUnloaded event
-   Removed client Java version from the WorldLoaded event

##### WorldLoaded & WorldUnloaded

Understanding how Minecraft is played allows us to focus game updates and improvements on the areas that are most relevant to players. The data that tells us this includes game mode, client or server modded status, and game version.

WorldLoaded & WorldUnloaded are two paired events that calculate how long the world session has lasted (in seconds and ticks). Data from WorldLoaded is sent when a world is launched, and data from WorldUnloaded is sent when a world is shut down (quitting to title, disconnecting from a server).

#### Optional telemetry events

-   Added PerformanceMetrics and WorldLoadTimes events

##### PerformanceMetrics

Knowing the overall performance profile of Minecraft helps us tune and optimize the game for a wide range of machine specifications and operating systems.

The periodic performance metrics includes data such as frame-rates, rendering performance, memory usage, operating system, and the modded status of the client and server.

Game version is included to help us compare the performance profile for new versions of Minecraft.

##### WorldLoadTimes

It’s important for us to understand how long it takes to join a world, and how that changes over time. For example, when we add new features or do larger technical changes, we need to see what impact that had on load times.

This event includes the total time in milliseconds for the world to load, whether this was a new world, as well as game version and platform details.

### Texture loading changes

-   Context: When the game loads all textures used by block and item models need to be stitched (merged) into a single image, called the "atlas"
    -   Individual textures that are stitched onto the atlas are called "sprites"
-   To improve loading performance, block and item textures are now loaded before they are processed by block and item models
    -   By default, textures not in the `textures/item` and `textures/block` directories will no longer be automatically recognized and will fail to load
-   Resource packs can now have configuration files, located in `atlases` directory, that control which images are included in the atlases

#### Atlas configuration files

-   New directory `atlases` is now present for resource packs
-   This directory contains JSON entries for configuring atlases:
    -   `blocks` - textures used by block and item models
    -   `banner_patterns`, `beds`, `chests`, `shield_patterns`, `shulker_boxes`, `signs` - used to render some special-case models
    -   `mob_effects` - textures used for effect icons in the UI
    -   `paintings` - textures used for paintings
    -   `particles` - textures used for particles (referenced by the `textures` field in files within the `particles` directory)
-   If multiple packs include those files, they are merged by their order within the pack (same as tags in data packs)
-   Inside these files is a JSON object with a single list called `sources`
    -   Every entry in `sources` runs in during load, in order of definition, adding or removing new files to the texture list; to be later referenced by block models, particles, etc
-   Types of sources:
    -   `directory` - lists all files in a directory and its subdirectories, across all namespaces
        -   `source` - directory in pack to be listed (relative to `textures` directory)
        -   `prefix` - string to be appended to the sprite name when loaded
    -   `single` - adds a single file
        -   `resource` - location of a resource within the pack (relative to `textures` directory, implied `.png` extension)
        -   `sprite` - sprite name (optional, defaults to `resource`)
    -   `filter` - removes sprites matching the given pattern
        -   `namespace`, `path` - patterns (regular expressions, regex) of ids to be removed (only works for entries already in the list)
            -   If omitted, any value will be matched
    -   `unstitch` - copies rectangular regions from other images
        -   `resource` - location of a resource within the pack (relative to `textures` directory, implied `.png` extension)
        -   `divisor_x`, `divisor_y` - used for determining the units used by regions
        -   `regions` - list of regions to copy from the source image
            -   `sprite` - sprite name
            -   `x`, `y` - coordinates of the top-left corner of the region
            -   `width`, `height` - size of the region
        -   Values such as `x` are transformed to real image coordinates via dividing by their divisor, and then multiplying by the real image size
-   Example: if a pack has a file named `assets/test/textures/fancy/iridium.png` and source is `{"type": "directory", "source": "fancy", "prefix": "custom/"}`, the texture will be available in models as `test:custom/iridium`

### Commands

-   New command: `fillbiome`
-   New execute sub-command: `execute if|unless biome`

#### `fillbiome`

Changes biome entries for an area. Note that biomes are not stored per-block, so affected positions may not match input precisely.

Syntax:

`fillbiome <from> <to> <biome>`

Parameters:

-   `from`: One corner of the area to fill
-   `to`: The other corner of the area to fill
-   `biome`: The biome to set

#### `execute`

Execute commands can now be conditional on biomes.

Syntax:

`execute if|unless biome <pos> <biome>`

# Minecraft Snapshot 22w42a

Hello there! We are now releasing the first snapshot for 1.19.3! You might have been thinking that this snapshot would be for 1.20, but times are changing. Going forward, we are taking a bit of a different approach to how we release minor and major versions for Minecraft: Java Edition. Essentially, we will be releasing minor versions more often. You can find out more details about this in a post over [here](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/articles/9971900758413).

In this snapshot we’re introducing feature toggle, which you might have seen in [a post we released yesterday](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/testing-new-minecraft-features/feature-toggles-java-edition). This means we can add a toggle for Update 1.20 with features such as the Camel, without committing to releasing them in version 1.19.3. This lets us have experimental features available for testing, while still being able to release updates with new functionality, changes, and improvements, without having to remove those features from the game first.

In this snapshot you’ll be seeing [the features that we talked about during Minecraft Live](https://www.minecraft.net/article/minecraft-live-2022-the-recap) as experimental features, a few changes to chat, some technical changes and many bug fixes.

## New Features in 22w42a

-   Some experimental features are now available through built-in experimental datapacks
-   Bundles are now available as an experimental feature
-   Added a new "Panorama Scroll Speed" accessibility option

### Experimental Features

-   Some experimental features now need to be enabled to appear in worlds
-   Such features are enabled by adding a built-in datapack when creating a world
-   Feature toggles are meant to hide unfinished or experimental features, to make sure your existing worlds remain unaffected
-   Worlds that are using experimental features will be marked as "Experimental" in world selection list
-   Experimental features cannot be toggled for existing worlds

#### Added Camel

Camels are now available when Update 1.20 experimental features are enabled.

-   Camels can be equipped with a saddle and ridden by two players
-   Camels spawn naturally in Desert Villages
-   Camels are tall
    -   Most hostile mobs will not be able to reach you when you are on a Camel
    -   They can walk over fences without a sweat
-   Camels are very graceful, but grumpy mobs
    -   They randomly sit down
    -   While sitting, it is difficult to convince them to move
-   Camels can either walk slowly or sprint quickly
-   They can also dash forward but will lose stamina for a while when doing so

#### Bamboo Wood Set

A new set of Bamboo wood blocks are now available when Update 1.20 experimental features are enabled.

-   New wood blocks
    -   Bamboo Planks
    -   Bamboo Door
    -   Bamboo Trapdoor
    -   Bamboo Sign
    -   Bamboo Stairs
    -   Bamboo Slab
    -   Bamboo Fence
    -   Bamboo Fence Gate
    -   Bamboo Button
    -   Bamboo Pressure Plate
-   Bamboo Planks can be crafted with 2x2 Bamboo items
-   Added a new "Mosaic" plank variant that is unique to Bamboo called Bamboo Mosaic
    -   It can be crafted with 1x2 Bamboo Slabs in a vertical strip
    -   You can craft Stair and Slab variants of Bamboo Mosaic
-   Added a unique Bamboo Raft and Bamboo Chest Raft which can be crafted like normal boats, but with Bamboo Planks
    -   They function the same as ordinary boats, but have a unique look to them

#### Chiseled Bookshelf

A new, chiseled variation of the Bookshelf is now available when Update 1.20 experimental features are enabled.

-   Crafted with 6 planks and 3 wooden slabs
-   Can store Books, Book and Quills, Written Books, and Enchanted Books
    -   Holds up to 6 books
    -   Keeps the stories and lore of your world safe
-   Comparators can detect the last book placed/removed
    -   Perfect for hiding secrets in your spooky library

#### Hanging Signs

Ever wanted to hang up your signs? Fetch a few chains, strip some logs, and now you can! Hanging signs are now available when Update 1.20 experimental features are enabled.

-   Hanging Signs are a more expensive version of normal Signs
    -   Crafted with 2 chains and 6 stripped logs of your preferred wood type
    -   Crafting results in 6 Hanging Signs
-   Can be hung up in the following ways:
    -   Underneath a block that can provide support in the center, like a full block or a fence
    -   Attached to the solid side of a block
    -   Attached to the side or underneath another Hanging Sign
-   Unlike normal Signs, they cannot be placed directly on the ground without support from the side or above
    -   However, Hanging Signs that have a horizontal bar will not pop when the supporting block is removed

### Sounds

-   Various wood types now have unique sounds when placed, broken, or walked on
    -   There are three sets of unique sounds: Overworld wood types, Nether wood types, and Bamboo

## Changes in 22w42a

-   Reworked the Creative Inventory tabs
-   Changes to chat
-   The Realms News button will now show a confirmation screen before opening the link
-   Stronghold placement code has been changed to be more efficient, causing stronghold positions to shift
    -   They are still placed in concentric rings, but their positions in the rings may change by a few degrees

### Creative Inventory

The ordering of tabs and the contents in the Creative Inventory have been tweaked to make the experience of finding relevant blocks and items easier.

-   Blocks and items have been moved into categories that fit them better
-   Blocks are now ordered by their material as much as possible
    -   For example, all Oak blocks and variants are now next to each other
-   Some items can now be found in more than one tab
-   Various tabs have been renamed or collapsed into others
-   The search tab now lists items sequentially grouped by the other tabs
    -   For example, items found in Building Blocks will always appear before items in Redstone Blocks
-   Petrified Oak Slab has been removed from the Creative Inventory
    -   It can still be accessed through commands
-   This is a first iteration to bring a better experience to the Creative Inventory, and we will look closely at the feedback for these changes to iterate as needed

### Chat

-   Removed Chat Preview
-   Chat messages deleted by server moderators will no longer be completely hidden, but rather replaced with text stating "This chat message has been deleted by the server."
-   Deleted chat messages will now be displayed in the chat window for at least 3 total seconds before being hidden
-   The Chat Trust Status indicators have been tweaked:
    -   The 'Modified' tag will no longer display for server-modified messages where only style has been changed
    -   The 'Modified' tag icon and indicator is now dark gray
    -   The 'Not Secure' tag is now light gray and does not have an icon
-   Partially filtered chat messages now show the filtered text as gray hashes with a hover text saying that it was filtered

## Technical Changes in 22w42a

-   Added Feature Flags - world options to enable or disable some experimental or unfinished features (like blocks, entities and items)
-   Network protocol changes
-   Instances of recipe types that have recipe books now have field `category` to determine placement

### Feature flags

#### General notes

-   Feature flags are options that enable or disable certain groups of game elements (like blocks, entities and items), later called "features"
-   Game elements controlled by flags are hardcoded
-   Feature flags are stored in world

#### Configuration and datapack changes

-   Feature flags are enabled by datapacks
    -   New pack metadata section called `features` is added, containing enabled feature flags in list named `enabled`
-   The game now contains built-in datapacks (similar to the "Programmer Art" resource pack) that enable features and provide associated recipes, advancements, loot tables, etc
-   Added new fields to `server.properties` to allow initial selection of packs (works only during world creation)
    -   `initial-enabled-packs` - comma-separated list of packs to be enabled (feature packs need to be explicitly enabled)
    -   `initial-disabled-packs` - comma-separated list of packs to not auto-enable
-   Datapacks discovered after world creation will be disabled if they require features that are not enabled for loaded world

#### Effects of feature flags

##### Blocks

-   Disabled block ids are not recognized by commands that can create new blocks
-   Block items for disabled blocks are disabled
-   Disabled blocks won't spawn in structures
-   Disabled blocks won't be loaded as part of entities (for example as falling sand or blocks carried by Endermen)
-   Players can't interact with disabled blocks

##### Entities

-   Disabled entity ids are not recognized by commands that can summon new entities
-   Disabled entities will not spawn or load
-   Spawn egg items for disabled entities are disabled

##### Items

-   Disabled items are hidden from creative menu
-   Recipes and loot tables are prevented from creating disabled items
-   Disabled item ids are not recognized by commands that can create new items
-   Disabled items can't be used for interactions or attacking

### Network Protocol

-   The network protocol now supports adding player entities to the world without being added to the 'tab' player list
-   Servers can now lazily distribute players' profile public keys along with their first chat packet
-   Message 'headers' within the Secure Chat protocol no longer need to be distributed when private messages are sent
-   Contextual message references are now deduplicated for efficiency within the Secure Chat network protocol

### Recipes

#### Crafting book categories

-   Crafting book categories/tabs can now be controlled by recipe definitions
-   Categories available for `shaped`/`shapeless` and various special crafting recipes:
    -   `building`
    -   `redstone`
    -   `equipment`
    -   `misc` (default)
-   Categories available for `smelting`, `blasting`, `smoking`, `campfire_cooking`
    -   `food`
    -   `blocks`
    -   `misc` (default)
-   Some crafting books collapse multiple categories into a single tab
-   The exact mappings might change in the future

### Resource Packs

-   The Resource Pack version is now 11
-   Removed "fixers" for resource packs with versions 3 and 4 (pre-flattening)
    -   The game will no longer try to adapt packs with those versions to the current version

# Minecraft 1.19.1 Pre-Release 3

Hi everyone,

Before we jump into today's pre-release, we would like to take a moment and dedicate some thoughts to a person who over the years has made an incredible impact on the Minecraft community and touched the lives of many. **Technoblade** became synonymous with a source of good – a positive force that time and time again made many, many people happy and someone we are proud to have as part of our giant family.

Minecraft is its community, which is why it should come as no surprise that so many of us mourn the loss of him, with tributes and love pouring in from across the world.

On behalf of the Java Team – thank you Technoblade for the memories, for all the fun and the laughter. You will be dearly missed. Our thoughts are with your family and friends.

* * *

Regarding 1.19.1: We still have a number of fixes in the pipeline, set for another pre-release in the near future. After that, once everything is tested and verified, we'll be aiming for a release candidate.

## Changes in 1.19.1 Pre-Release 3

-   System messages (non-player chat, such as those outputted by commands) are displayed with a gray color indicator

## Technical changes in 1.19.1 Pre-Release 3

-   The list of players on the Social Interactions screen now places entries for players with recently seen messages at the top of the list
-   The `msg_command` chat type has been split apart into `msg_command_incoming` and `msg_command_outgoing`
-   The `team_name` chat type parameter has been renamed to `target`
    -   This chat type parameter is now used by `msg_command_outgoing`

## Fixed bugs in 1.19.1 Pre-Release 3

-   [MC-253182](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-253182) The second instance of a reflexive pronoun is used incorrectly within the "gui.abuseReport.reason.self\_harm\_or\_suicide.description" string

# Minecraft 1.19.1 Pre-Release 2

Hey everyone! As a few of you might have noticed, we’ve made the decision to postpone the release of 1.19.1 and we're now going back into pre-release mode. This is in order to address a few of our more noticeable issues. We've yet to fully decide on a new release date, but it won't be too far in the future.

We’ve received a lot of feedback regarding the Player Chat Report feature, which is something we address specifically in a newly released post [here](https://www.minecraft.net/article/addressing-player-chat-reporting-tool), as well as in our [FAQ](https://aka.ms/chatreportingfaq) which hopefully answers all your questions!

## Changes in 1.19.1 Pre-Release 2

We've added the ability to see the signing status of chat messages – this is so you can easily tell when a server is tampering with, or removing the signing security of, their players' messages.

### Chat Trust Status

-   Messages that are not signed with the Secure Chat system, or have been tampered with by the server will now be marked
    -   Messages with missing or invalid signatures are marked as "Not Secure"
    -   Messages that are detected as modified are marked as "Modified"
-   The trust status of messages are displayed with both a colored indicator and an icon
    -   The colored indicator is always visible
    -   The icon is only visible when the chat screen is open
-   Hovering over the icon will provide more information about the trust status
    -   For modified messages, the original secure text will also be displayed in the tooltip

## Technical changes in 1.19.1 Pre-Release 2

### Chat Types

-   Chat types added to the `chat_types` registry are now only used for player chat, and not system messages
    -   The `system` and `game_info` chat types have been removed
-   Chat types have been simplified and are now only required to define `chat` and `narration` decorations
    -   Chat types no longer support overlays
    -   A system message should instead be used to display overlays

### server.properties

-   `enforce-secure-profile` is now defaulted to `true` for dedicated servers

## Fixed Bugs in 1.19.1 Pre-Release 2

-   [MC-253112](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-253112) The game output console is logged with warnings regarding chat packets with invalid signatures when using entity selectors within commands
-   [MC-253121](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-253121) Entities and other non-player chat message sources appear as players on the Select Chat Messages to Report screen
-   [MC-253493](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-253493) The descriptions of report categories can once again overlap the "Description:" subtitle
-   [MC-253495](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-253495) Selection boxes of fields within the "Select Report Category" menu list don't contain white outlines when selected using the TAB key
-   [MC-253497](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-253497) Entities and other non-player chat message sources appear in the Social Interactions menu
-   [MC-253501](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-253501) Long messages within the "Select Chat Messages to Report" menu can extend beyond selection boxes and past the scroll bar
-   [MC-253517](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-253517) Online players cannot connect to offline server because "invalid profile public key signature"

# Minecraft 1.19.1 Release Candidate 1

# Minecraft Snapshot 22w24a

New snapshot! We're now heading towards 1.19.1, which will add Allay duplication, the ability to report chat, and, of course, fix a few bugs.

On the topic of chat reporting, we want everyone to feel safe and welcome in Minecraft, which is why we have community guidelines in place. If you feel unsafe, uncomfortable, or concerned that someone is breaking our [Community Guidelines](https://www.minecraft.net/community-standards) or the [Xbox Community Standards](https://www.xbox.com/legal/community-standards), you can soon report this in-game. Of course, it will also be possible to report incidents over at the [Report a Concern](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=4416074743565) page.

We are looking for feedback regarding the Chat Reporting feature. For now, any reports made during the testing period may not be actioned on.

Enjoy!

It is now possible to report a player for sending abusive messages in the game chat.

A reporter is required to select the individual chat messages that contain the objectionable content, as well as the category of the report, this is to provide the best context for our moderation team to take action.

Accessed via the social interactions screen (default keybind is P).

-   The social interactions screen is now available via the Pause screen when in a multiplayer game

# Minecraft 1.19 Pre-Release 2

A recent change made it possible for more types of mobs to spawn inside Nether Portals, which caused them to instantly change dimensions after spawning. We will not be making any further changes to this before the release of 1.19, but our intent for the future is to prevent most mobs from spawning in Nether Portals and the ones that do will not immediately travel through the portal. Expect to see these changes in a coming version.

## Changes in 1.19 Pre-release 2

​

-   If the Warden is stuck in a liquid, it will angrily despawn instead of digging
-   Reverted using `generic equip` sound when equipping blocks in the head slot

## Technical Changes in 1.19 Pre-release 2

-   Added game event `teleport` with a vibration frequency of 5

# Minecraft Snapshot 22w19a

Thursday snapshot! Apart from some bugfixes and some changes to fancy tags and commands, we're introducing "chat preview" as a way to cryptographically sign chat messages that have been dynamically styled by servers. And for this snapshot only, we've left in our testing option `test-rainbow-chat` in `server.properties`, which can be set to true together with the new `previews-chat` option for testing. If this is something that interests you, and especially if you run a server, we would love your feedback on it.

Enjoy!

## Changes in 22w19a

-   Warden and Iron Golems now make sure to spawn above something solid

## Technical Changes in 22w19a

-   Servers can now enable Chat Preview, which displays a server-controlled preview above the chat edit box
-   Changes to the locate and place commands
-   Point of Interest tags

### Chat Preview

-   Servers can enable Chat Preview by setting `previews-chat=true` in `server.properties`
-   When enabled, a server-controlled preview appears above the chat edit box, showing how the message will look when sent
-   This can be used by servers to preview messages with styling applied, such as emojis or chat coloring
-   Chat Preview sends chat messages to the server as they are typed, even before they're sent
    -   The server then sends back the styled preview in real time
    -   This allows servers to apply dynamic message stylings while still allowing chat to be securely signed
-   A warning screen is shown on the client when joining a server with Chat Preview, and it can be globally disabled in Chat Settings
-   Dynamic chat styling can also be controlled by the server, although this is only signed when Chat Preview is enabled
    -   Clients can prefer to always show the original, signed message by enabling "Only Show Signed Chat" in Chat Settings

### Commands

-   Added template sub-command to `place`\-command
-   `locate` command moved to `locate structure`, `locatebiome` moved to `locate biome`
-   Added `locate poi <type: point_of_interest_type>`
-   Servers will now also send an additional icon and MOTD packet after a player has connected
    -   This allows servers with `enable-status=false` to set an icon and MOTD for players that successfully connect

#### Place template

The `place`\-command can now also place templates at a given location. Syntax: `place template <template> [pos] [rotation] [mirror] [integrity] [seed]`

-   `place template` works like using the load button in the UI for a structure block

Parameters:

-   `template`: The namespaced id of a template ("structure block file") to load and place
-   `rotation`: The rotation to apply (if omitted, `none` is used)
-   `mirror`: The mirroring to apply (if omitted, `none` is used)
-   `integrity`: The structure integrity value between 0 and 1
-   `seed`: The seed to use for the randomized degradation when integrity is less than 1

### Point of Interest types

-   Removed `unemployed` and `nitwit` `point_of_interest_type`s
-   Added tag `point_of_interest_type/acquirable_job_site` for all job sites seeked by Villagers with `none` profession
-   Added tag `point_of_interest_type/village` for PoI that are part of Village
-   Added tag `point_of_interest_type/bee_home` for all PoI targeted by Bees

# Minecraft Snapshot 22w17a

Prepare to drop some sick bleats in the latest Minecraft: Java Edition snapshot! We're bringing in the sweet sounds of the goat horn. There are also some changes to the warden and the allay.

If the technical aspects of chatting is where it's at for you, make sure to check out the changes to chat signing.

Enjoy!

## New Features in 22w17a

-   Added Goat Horn!

### Goat Horn

-   A Goat Horn drops when a Goat rams a tree or any other hard block that occurs naturally where Goats spawn (Logs, Stone, Packed Ice, Iron Ore, copper Ore, or Emerald Ore)
    -   Other solid blocks are unfamiliar to the Goat, so it won't ram them
-   Use the horn to play a loud sound that can be heard from afar
-   Each horn has its own sound based on the Goat it originated from
-   There are 8 Goat Horn variants, 4 of them exclusive to screaming Goats
-   Goat Horns can sometimes be found in Pillager Outposts

## Changes in 22w17a

-   The Allay connecting with Note Blocks is now better visualized by the vibration particle
-   The Allay connecting with Note Blocks can now be blocked by Wool Blocks again
-   Replaced realms subtle selected world highlight with a clear green checkmark
-   Updated the Brewing Stand's base UVs and texture to match a graphical fix in Bedrock Edition
-   Explosions caused by player-ignited TNT now cause experience to drop from broken blocks (such as ore blocks and sculk)
    -   We will be keeping an eye on feedback for this change, it might change in a future update
-   Sculk blocks now have very low blast resistance
-   Warden balancing

### Warden

-   Their ranged attack will now:
    -   Bypass shields and armor
    -   Deal 10 damage instead of 30 damage, and the cooldown has been reduced from 5 seconds to 2 seconds
    -   Display a custom death message
-   Wardens now drop a single Sculk Catalyst upon death

## Technical Changes in 22w17a

-   Signed Chat
-   Removed `dampenable_vibrations` game event tag

### Multiplayer Secure Chat Signing

This is the first step in a process to provide more security and player safety features for in-game chat. We'd love to hear your thoughts, but keep in mind that many features such as server-driven styling of chat messages are still missing.

-   Chat messages between players are now cryptographically signed
-   Players are given a Mojang provided key-pair on startup
-   Servers can require players to have a Mojang-signed public key by setting `enforce-secure-profile=true` in `server.properties`
    -   Enforcing secure profiles will prevent players without a Mojang-signed public key from connecting
    -   By default this is set to `false`, allowing players to connect without a Mojang-signed public key
-   Chat styling is now handled via server resource packs with the translation key `chat.type.text`

# Minecraft Snapshot 22w15a

Let me tell you a little story about hubris. Well, not so much a story as a lament. Because some of you have been thinking that the warden was a little too easy. I won’t name names, but I know you’re out there. Why else would we be adding ranged attacks for this already terrifying mob? Was the sniffing not enough? When will it end? Not today, apparently.

# Minecraft Snapshot 22w14a

Mangrove trees! Warm frogs! Mud blocks! More mangrove trees! Today, we’re happy to bring you the most mud-tastic Java snapshot to date!

Sure, it might be our only mud-tastic snapshot to date – but the important thing is that our new biome, mangrove swamp, now is available for testing, along with nitty-gritty features like the recovery compass and other, more technical tidbits.

Enjoy!

## New Features in 22w14a

-   Added Clay renewability
-   Added Mangrove Trees
-   Added Mangrove Swamp biome
-   Added Echo Shard and Recovery Compass

### Clay renewability

-   Placing Mud above a block that has Pointed Dripstone underneath will eventually turn the mud block into Clay

### Mangrove trees

Introducing a new type of water-adapted tree that spawns propped up on roots

-   Have a chance of spawning a Bee Nest
-   Grows from Mangrove Propagules

### Mangrove Swamp

Muddy! Murky! Magnificent! Welcome to the newest biome - the Mangrove Swamp

-   Located in warmer, more humid places where you'd normally find the Swamp biome in Minecraft
-   Here you can find Bees and Warm Frogs
-   The floor of this biome is coated with a thick layer of Mud, so be sure to pack your best boots
-   Have a nice boat ride under and around the larger-than-life roots of mangrove trees

### Recovery Compass

A new Recovery Compass can be crafted with Echo Shards which can only be found and are unique to Ancient City chests

-   Unlike a normal Compass, the Recovery Compass will point to the last place you died
-   If you are not in the dimension you last died, or you haven't died yet in your world, it will randomly spin
-   It can be crafted with 1 Compass surrounded by 8 Echo Shards, which can be found in Ancient Cities

## Changes in 22w14a

-   The Warden will now get angry at ALL living mobs that bump into it, not just players

## Technical Changes in 22w14a

-   `CatType` fields on enitites with type `minecraft:cat` have been replaced with `variant`, with numeric values being replaced with string ids (so, for example, `5` becomes `minecraft:calico`)
-   Some mutually exclusive tests in entity predicate (`player`, `fishing_hook`, `lightning_bolt` and `catType`) have been collapsed to `type_specific` field
-   Added `item_delivered_to_player` advancement trigger
-   Added `allay_drop_item_on_block` advancement trigger

### Predicates

#### Entity predicate

-   `player`, `fishing_hook`, `lightning_bolt` and `catType` fields have been replaced with `type_specific`
-   `type_specific` has field `type` (one of `player`, `fishing_hook`, `lightning_bolt` or `cat`) and same fields as removed fields
-   Example:
    
    -   Before:
    
         "lightning_bolt": {
           "blocks_set_on_fire": 0
         }
        
    
    -   After
    
          "type_specific": {
            "type": "lightning",
            "blocks_set_on_fire": 0
          }
        
    
-   `catType` has been wrapped to match new format and now uses new cat variant names instead of texture names:
    
    -   Before
    
         "catType": "minecraft:textures/entity/cat/british_shorthair.png"
        
    
    -   After
    
         "type_specific": {
            "type": "cat",
            "variant": "minecraft:british"
         }
        
    
-   New `type_specific` options:
    -   `frog` has `variant` field matching frog variant (`minecraft:warm`, `minecraft:temperate` or `minecraft:cold`)
    -   `slime` applies for slimes and magma creams, has `size` field matching slime size (smallest is `1`)

### Advancements

-   Removed field `location` from triggers `location`, `slept_in_bed`, `hero_of_the_village` and `voluntary_exile` - it was handled exactly the same as `player.location`

#### New triggers

##### `item_delivered_to_player`

-   Triggered when an allay delivers an item to a player
-   Conditions:
    -   `player` - a player for which this trigger runs

##### `allay_drop_item_on_block`

-   Triggered when an allay drops an item on a block
-   Conditions:
    -   `player` - a player for which this trigger runs
    -   `location` - a predicate for the block that the item was dropped on
    -   `item` - a predicate for the item that was dropped

# Minecraft Snapshot 22w13a

**Allay**, the mob that nobody is really sure how to pronounce, is now entering the latest Minecraft: Java Edition snapshot. Along with our new shiny blue friend, we've added the **ancient** **cities**, which have seen some pretty drastic changes since the experimental snapshot a few weeks ago, so make sure you check them out.

Happy mining!

## New Features in 22w13a

-   Added Allay mob
-   Added Ancient Cities

### Allay

-   Allays will collect all the surrounding items that match the item they are holding
-   Allays will like a player who hands them an item and will bring the items they collect to their liked player
-   If the Allay hears a noteblock play, that noteblock becomes the Allay's favorite noteblock for 30 seconds. The Allay will stay near that noteblock for that duration and bring its collected items to the noteblock instead of to the player
-   Interacting with an Allay with an empty hand will remove the item the Allay is holding
-   Allays can be found in Pillager Outposts and Woodland Mansions

### Ancient City

Wander the halls of these long-abandoned structures in the Deep Dark depths to uncover some relics long forgotten.

-   Ancient City structures spawn in the Deep Dark biome
-   In chests, guarded by sculk sensors and shriekers, you can find the new Swift Sneaking enchantment
-   You can also find a new mysterious block called Reinforced Deepslate here, which cannot be obtained in Survival
-   Mobs cannot spawn in Ancient Cities

#### Differences compared to the Experimental Deep Dark snapshot

-   Many adjustments have been made to Ancient Cities, with new and tweaked structures
-   Loot tables have been adjusted for Ancient Cities, including a separate loot table for the "ice box" structures

## Changes in 22w13a

-   The recipes for minecart with chest/furnace/tnt/hopper are now shapeless
-   When broken each minecart variant drops itself as item, instead of splitting into two items (such as chest and minecart)
-   Only wool and wool carpets now block the sounds coming from noteblocks

## Technical Changes in 22w13a

-   Added `kill_mob_near_sculk_catalyst` advancement trigger
-   Sculk shrieker block state changes
-   Renamed some game events

### Advancements

#### New triggers

##### `kill_mob_near_sculk_catalyst`

-   Triggered when a player kills an entity next to Sculk Catalyst
-   Conditions:
    -   `player` - a player for which this trigger runs
    -   `entity` - a predicate for the entity that was killed
    -   `killing_blow` - a predicate for how the entity was killed

### Sculk Shrieker

-   Added `can_summon` blockstate to the Sculk Shrieker that determines whether a Shrieker can summon a Warden or not
-   Shriekers placed via worldgen will have `can_summon` set to true
-   When a Shrieker is placed or generated via Sculk spread, `can_summon` is set to false

### Game Events

Some game events have been renamed, with some of those changes to make them more gramatically consistent:

-   `drinking_finish` -> `drink`
-   `entity_killed` -> `entity_die`
-   `entity_damaged` -> `entity_damage`
-   `elytra_free_fall` -> `elytra_glide`
-   `mob_interact` -> `entity_interact`
-   `ravager_roar` -> `entity_roar`
-   `wolf_shaking` -> `entity_shake`

The following events have been collapsed into `block_activate` and `block_deactivate`:

-   `block_press`
-   `block_unpress`
-   `block_switch`
-   `block_unswitch`

Other miscellaneous changes to game events:

-   `ring_bell` has been removed and replaced with `block_change`
-   Both `shulker_open` and `shulker_close` have been removed in favour of using `container_open` and `container_close`
-   `fishing_rod_cast` and `fishing_rod_reel_in` have been renamed to `item_interact_start` and `item_interact_finish`
-   Added `ignore_vibrations_on_occluding_block` game event tag with subsequent logic
-   `entity_interact` should be dispatched more often when interacting with various mobs

# Minecraft Snapshot 22w12a

Waaaaaaaaaaah! It's Wal... wait that's not it. It's the warden! The spooky, unfriendly (maybe it just wants a hug?) mob is making its way into our latest snapshot.

Additionally, you'll be seeing some functionality for the sculk shriekers and some fancy new boats (they have chests).

Enjoy!

## New Features in 22w12a

-   Added Darkness mob effect
-   Added Sculk Shrieker functionality
-   Added the Warden mob
-   Added boat with chest
-   Added the Swift Sneak enchantment

### Sculk Shrieker

-   Added functionality to the Sculk Shrieker: Notable for its boney appendages, this block responds to Sculk Sensors detecting vibrations by sending out a warning call to distant Wardens
    -   Watch out when stepping on them, as they will feel that too and send out a call!
-   Initially it may take some time for a Warden to arrive, but you'll hear it responding in the distance...
-   Once it's close enough, a call from the Sculk Shrieker will summon the Warden nearby - be prepared!

Added Warden mob

### Warden

The horror of the Deep Dark! A creature with no eyes, roughly resembling the Sculk that can be found throughout the Deep Dark, the Warden is an unstoppable force of nature that inhabits this biome

-   Just like Sculk Sensors, these terrifying creatures use vibrations as a means to navigate their environment
-   When vibrations aren't enough, they will also use a sense of smell to track down their prey - you can observe them sniffing their surroundings to get closer to unsuspecting players and mobs
-   To add to their myriad of ways to detect you, try not to get too close! If you collide with a Warden, it will notice you
-   In the Deep Dark, Wardens are everywhere - you just can't see them. They slumber beneath your feet, and only dig out when enough Sculk Shriekers have alerted them of your presence
-   Watch your step: the more vibrations a Warden detects, the more angry it will get. You can hear and see this from how fast the souls in its chest are beating
-   Once a mob has pushed beyond the Warden's anger threshold, it will face its prey and roar before charging
-   If, however, you keep the Warden from noticing you or getting angry for 60 seconds, it will dig back underground and despawn
-   They have a special interaction with thrown projectiles
    -   If the Warden receives two projectile vibrations within 5 seconds of one another, it will grow angrier at the shooter
    -   If the Warden receives a projectile vibration more than 5 seconds from the last projectile, it will not grow angrier at the shooter
    -   This allows you to strategically distract the Warden without it getting angry while you take loot from nearby chests
-   Unfortunately for all players, Wardens will also disable shields when they hit them with their fists
-   They do not drop any loot
-   Wardens are powerful creatures, and it is often better to sneak around one that has emerged instead of taking it head on - you've been warned

### Darkness

-   A new mob effect unique to the Warden and Sculk Shrieker, which will afflict you with it when nearby
-   Lowers the gamma down at an equivalent of "Moody" while having this effect
-   In periodic pulses, will lower the overall brightness of the world so that the darkness creeps up against light sources
-   When the Warden is around, torches will be more important than ever!
-   A new Accessibility slider has been added in your Options menu called “Darkness Pulsing”
    -   Controls how dark the Darkness effect gets when a Warden or Sculk Shrieker gives it to you, but will not affect the fog distance

### Boat with chest

-   Lets you bring more stuff on your boat adventures
-   If you are in the boat, press the open inventory key to access the chest contents
-   If you are not in the boat, shift-right click to access the chest contents
-   If you break the boat the chest contents will spill out, like with other chests
-   Also works with hoppers, droppers, and other blocks that interact with chests
-   Like other chests, opening a boat chest or breaking the boat will anger piglins, since they think all chests belong to them

### Swift Sneak

Imbue your leggings with this shiny new enchantment to move as fast while crouching as you would normally walk!

-   When applied, it will increase your movement speed while sneaking
-   Has 3 different levels with different speed increases
-   It is the first enchantment unique to leggings equipment!

## Changes in 22w12a

-   The Deep Dark biome is now less flooded than surrounding areas
-   Leaves are now waterloggable
-   Removed debug hotkey cycling render distance

# Minecraft Snapshot 22w11a

Minecraft: Java Edition is jumping on the Wild Update train! The first snapshot for 1.19 is now available. It contains frogs, the Deep Dark, and a bunch of new blocks. We've also entered the era of 3D directional audio. Keeping up with the times!

Happy mining!

## New Features in 22w11a

-   Added the Deep Dark biome
-   Added Frogs & Tadpoles
-   Added mangrove blocks
-   Added mud and mud brick blocks
-   Added Sculk, Sculk Veins, Sculk Shrieker and Sculk Catalyst blocks
-   Added 3D Directional Audio option

### Deep Dark

Dig into the depths far underground to uncover the darkest biome in Minecraft - the Deep Dark.

-   Dimly lit and eerie, the Deep Dark is sure to strike fear into the hearts of even the most brave player
-   The floor of the Deep Dark is covered in sculk
-   No mobs spawn in the Deep Dark

### Frog

-   Frogs can jump
-   Frogs can swim
-   Frogs can walk on land
-   Frogs can croak
-   Frogs can eat small slimes, causing a slime ball to drop
-   Frogs can eat small Magma Cubes, causing a Froglight block to drop
-   Each Frog variant drops a specific Froglight Block
-   Three Froglight blocks are added, a lightsource block

### Tadpoles

-   Tadpoles can swim in water
-   Tadpoles on land "jump around" like fishes on land, and eventually dies
-   Tadpoles that grows up turns into a Frog
-   Tadpoles grow into a different type of frog based on the biome they are born in (Cold, Temperate, Warm)
-   Tadpoles can be caught in a bucket

### Mangrove wood blocks

Added a new type of wood: Mangrove! Mangrove biome + mangrove trees are coming in a later snapshot.

-   Mangrove log and stripped mangrove log
-   Mangrove wood and stripped mangrove wood
-   Mangrove roots and muddy mangrove roots
-   Mangrove boat, button, pressure plate, door, trapdoor, sign, slab, fence, fence gate, and stairs

### Mangrove leaves and propagules

-   Mangrove propagule is a sapling that grows from the bottom of mangrove leaves
-   Bonemealing mangrove leaves will cause a new propagule to start growing beneath it
-   Propagules grow through 4 stages, and growth can be accelerated by bonemealing
-   You can break off a fully grown propagule and plant it like a sapling. For now it will grow in an oak tree, but will of course grow into a mangrove tree when that is done.

### Mud

-   Mud is a block that will generate in the upcoming Mangrove biome.
-   When walking on mud, entities sink down a bit. Like soul sand, but without the slowdown.
-   Mud can be created by using a water bottle on dirt, by hand or with a dispenser.
-   Packed mud can be crafted from mud

### Mud bricks

-   Mud bricks are a building block that can be crafted from packed mud
-   Mud bricks can be crafted into Mud brick stairs, walls, and slabs using a crafting table or stonecutter.

### Sculk

The rattling tendrils of the Sculk Sensors had to come from somewhere, right? Introducing Sculk, a new family of blocks that dwells in the Deep Dark.

-   Added Sculk Catalyst block, a mysteriously soul-emitting block that blooms with Sculk patches underneath nearby dying mobs
    -   Mobs that perish in the presence of the catalyst will not drop their experience
-   Added Sculk blocks
    -   When a mob dies near a Sculk Catalyst, some unknown process seems to consume blocks beneath and turn them into Sculk blocks
    -   Sculk charge when spreading will have a chance to grow certain blocks, like Sculk Sensors on top of it, consuming its charge.
-   Added Sculk Vein blocks
    -   These veins are found on the edge of Sculk patches
    -   Similar to Glow Lichen, they can be placed in any orientation
    -   Spreading of veins causes other blocks to be taken over by the sculk
    -   Sculk Vein can spread underwater
-   Added Sculk Shrieker block.
    -   Sculk Shriekers can be found growing rarely from the charge of a Sculk Catalyst
    -   Sculk Shrieker can be waterlogged
    -   Sculk Shrieker requires Silk Touch to obtain otherwise drops experience when mined
-   Souls from mobs will spread through Sculk Veins and Sculk Blocks in random directions until

they find a valid substrate they can feed of off - The charge from souls in the Sculk Blocks and Sculk Veins will eventually decay, but it will decay much, much slower in the close vicinity of the Sculk Catalyst, and much faster away from its host - If the charge is dropped outside the range of the Catalyst, it has a chance of growing a Sculk Sensor

-   Sculk, Sculk Veins and Sculk Catalysts require Silk Touch to acquire. Otherwise, they drop experience when mined
-   The efficient tool for all Sculk family blocks is the Hoe

### 3D Directional Audio

-   Added sound option for 3D Directional Audio simulation
-   This option is best experienced with headphones

## Technical Changes in 22w11a

-   The data pack format is now 10
-   The resource pack format is now 9
-   Added 3D Blending
-   Added new font glyph provider for spaces
-   Added estimated GPU utilization percentage to performance profiling metrics and F3 debug screen
    -   This is only available for graphics devices that support GPU timer queries
-   Added ability for data and resource packs to selectively hide files from packs below them
-   World presets/types and flat world presets in "Create World" screen can now be controlled by datapacks
-   Added server property `max-chained-neighbor-updates` to limit the amount of consecutive neighbor updates before skipping additional ones. Negative values remove the limit.

### Blending

-   Blending now support 3d biome blending, so it will blend the underground biomes as well.
-   Removed `blending_data.old_noise`, now existence of `blending_data` in chunk data determines if a chunk is considered old
-   Added `blending_data.min_section` and `blending_data.max_section` that determines which sections will be used for data for blending

### Space glyph provider

-   New glyph provider type `space` is added to allow creation of space-like glyphs
-   New provider has single argument called `advances` which is map of codepoint to glyph advance (width)
-   Rendering of space glyph is not longer hardcoded (needs to be declared manually in font)

### Pack filters

-   Data and resource packs can have `filter` section in `pack.mcmeta`.
-   This section has mandatory field `block`, which is a list of patterns (regular expressions) for namespaces and paths.
-   If any of files in packs added before one with `filter` section matches any pattern inside `block`, it will be filtered out (i.e. treated as if it wasn't present in the first place).
-   `filter` section does not apply to a pack containing it - only to packs loaded before it.
-   Both `namespace` and `path` can be omited. Missing field matches every value.
-   For example, adding pack with this section in `pack.mcmeta` after vanilla pack will hide all recipes and advancements defined by vanilla pack

    "filter": {
        "block": [
            {
                "namespace": "minecraft",
                "path": "recipes/.*"
            },
            {
                "namespace": "minecraft",
                "path": "advancements/.*"
            }
        ]
    }
    

### World presets

-   New registry types `worldgen/world_preset` and `worldgen/flat_level_generator_preset` were added to data-drive presents (like "Amplified" or "Single Biome")
-   Two tags for world presets added (`normal` and `alternative`) to control values show on "World Type" button in "Create World" screen
-   One tag added for flat world presents (`visible`) to control order of elements displayed in "Configure Flat World" screen
-   World presets can also be used as a value of `level-type` in `server.properties`

### Predicates

-   The `feature` field in location predicates is now called `structure`

# Minecraft 1.18.2 Pre-Release 1

We're now releasing the first pre-release for Minecraft 1.18.2. This pre-release introduces the possibility for data packs to customize cave generation and to add new custom structures to worlds.

If everything goes as expected, we aim to release this version on February 28th.

Happy mining!

## Changes in 1.18.2 Pre-release 1

-   Users running Minecraft in a 32-bit environment will receive a warning in the main menu about the upcoming end of 32-bit environment support

## Technical Changes in 1.18.2 Pre-release 1

-   The data pack version is now 9
-   It is now possible to add custom structures in experimental datapacks
-   `locate` and `locatebiome` commands now support tags (prefix with `#` to distinguish from normal ids)
-   The `locate` command parameter is now a configured structure rather than a structure type. For instance, you can now use `/locate village_desert` or `/locate shipwreck_beached`
-   A lot of the cave generation is now configurable through data packs

### Configurable caves

-   A new registry was added for Density functions (caves are created by combining those together)
-   Noise settings got a new field `noise_router` (and lost a couple of flags), see `worldgen/noise_settings` folder in the worldgen report
-   Noise router wires data-driven parts of the cave generation with the rest of the code

### Configured Structures and Structure Sets

The game now generates and stores data-driven configured structures.

-   Experimental datapacks can add new structure sets
-   The `feature` field in location predicates now references a configured feature
-   The `exploration_map` loot table function `destination` field is now a configured feature tag id
-   The `exploration_map` loot table function no longer automatically sets the display name of the map

#### Side effects

Some gameplay oddities have been affected by this change.

-   Dolphins will now more accurately pick the closest structure regardless of type

# Minecraft Snapshot 22w06a

Today we're happy to share snapshot 22w06a with you. It contains compliance updates for South Korean players and is Totally Teeming with Technical Tag Tastiness.

Happy Mining (in moderation)!

## Changes in 22w06a

If you’re playing in South Korea, we added gameplay timers and notices in compliance with gaming laws to help remind players to take occasional breaks from gameplay. For more information, please see [the FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/articles/360052763631).

## Technical Changes in 22w06a

-   Any type present in registries (blocks, items, biomes, etc.) can now have tags

### Universal tags

-   Tags can now be defined for any registry (blocks, items, biomes, etc. - see `registries.json` in report)
-   New tags are stored in datapacks under `tags` directory (same as old ones)
    -   Names of new tag directories are the same as registry names (so `/data/[namespace]/tags/potion` and `/data/[namespace]/tags/worldgen/biome`)
    -   Existing tags (`blocks`, `items`, `fluids`, `entity_types`, `game_events` and `functions`) keep their name (for now)
-   Some fields in worldgen structures that previously only lists of element ids now accept tags
    -   Those entries now accept `[id, ...]`, `id` (shortcut for `[id]`) and `#tag`
    -   Changed fields are:
        -   `feature.glow_lichen` configuration: `can_be_placed_on`
        -   `feature.spring_feature` configuration: `valid_blocks`
        -   `feature.simple_random_selector` configuration: `features`
        -   `block_predicate_type.matching_blocks`: `blocks`
        -   `block_predicate_type.matching_fluids`: `fluids`
        -   `biome`: inner list in `features`, map value in `carvers`
        -   `biome_source.checkerboard`: `biomes`
-   Some tag fields now require id to be prepended with `#` (however they are not yet accepting element list)
    -   `dimension_type`: `infiniburn`
    -   `feature.geode` configration: `blocks.cannot_replace`, `blocks.invalid_blocks`
    -   `feature.vegetation_patch`, `feature.waterlogged_vegetation_patch` configuration: `replaceable`
    -   `feature.root_system` configuration: `root_replaceable`
    -   `structure_processor.protected_blocks`: `value`

## Fixed bugs in 22w06a

-   [MC-105317](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-105317) Structure blocks do not rotate entities correctly when loading
-   [MC-239708](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-239708) Superflat world "Water World" preset settings are obsolete for the 1.18 update

# Minecraft 1.18 Pre-Release 2

The second pre-release for Minecraft Java is now available. In this pre-release, we've upgraded the Java version that is bundled with the game, and the game now uses Java 17. Other than this, we've mostly been busy fixing bugs.

Enjoy!

## Technical Changes in 1.18 Pre-Release 2

Minecraft now uses Java version 17. If you are using a default setup the Launcher will download and install the correct version. If you are using a custom Java setup or a third-party launcher, you will need to ensure that your Java installation is version 17 or above.

# Minecraft 1.18 Pre-Release 1

The first 1.18 pre-release is here!

From now on, you should mostly see bugs being fixed. In addition to that, pre-releases don't follow the regular snapshot cadence of releasing on Wednesdays, so keep an eye out!

That being said, this pre-release introduces biome blending, which means that you should no longer find harsh borders between new and old terrain. On top of that, we've also reintroduced the Amplified and Large Biome world types.

Happy mining!

## Changes in 1.18 Pre-Release 1

-   Amplified and Large biome worlds have been adapted to the new terrain and are now once again available in the Create World screen
-   Removed world types "Caves" and "Floating islands" from the world creation screen
-   The transition between new and old terrain is less "cliffy"
    -   Will surface height blend? Yes
    -   Will biomes blend? Yes
    -   Will caves blend? Your mileage may vary

## Technical changes in 1.18 Pre-Release 1

-   `--report` option in data generator now creates full worldgen reference files instead of just biomes

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w44a

Another snapshot is now available. We've added new world generation below existing chunks, and blocks and fluids are now also part of the simulation distance setting. We also fixed a few bugs.

Keep in mind that we're still working on the world upgrades, so making a backup before upgrading is still a good idea.

Enjoy!

## New Features in 21w44a

-   New world generation is now inserted under existing chunks when upgrading a world to the new world height
-   Added an Online options screen where you can now find the Realms Notifications option and Difficulty when on a server
-   Added an "Allow Server Listings" option to opt-out of having your name displayed in server listings

## Changes in 21w44a

-   Sleeping now only resets the weather cycle if it was raining
-   Blocks and fluids are now also affected by simulation distance. It might be a good idea to test that the behavior of your Redstone contraptions remained the same
-   Optimized entity collisions

## Technical Changes in 21w44a

-   Servers can now set property `hide-online-players` to `true` in order to not send a player list on status requests
-   When JFR profiling is started from an external source, the JFR events for network packets are now aggregated instead of one event per packet

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w43a

Here's a snapshot from the blender! In this snapshot, world generation around the edges of an old world will now be adjusted for a smoother transition! This is the first iteration of this system which we expect to keep improving. Keep in mind that if you try it out now, the result will be saved to your world forever - which, as we know, is quite a long time. Better be safe than sorry. Make a backup before you try it!

Also - the space underneath existing chunks is now filled in, but only with deepslate. We will later be adding full cave generation in this place, so if you want that in your world, make a backup before you try it!

Due to some updates to terrain generation in this snapshot, seeds have shuffled once again so worlds will not look like they did in the previous snapshot. We expect world seeds to be stable after this snapshot.

Oh yeah, did we mention that it's a good idea to make a backup?

## New Features in 21w43a

-   The edge between old and new world generation is now adjusted when you upgrade a world

### Upgrading of old worlds

-   When generating close to old chunks hew terrain is adjusted to better match the existing terrain at the borders
-   In old chunks, if there is Bedrock at y=0, the column below will be filled with Deepslate
    -   Worlds upgraded in this snapshot will permanently have this deepslate, so if you want new caves under height 0 later, make sure to keep a backup before upgrading
-   The old Bedrock between y=0 and y=4 in old chunks gets replaced with Deepslate
-   A new Bedrock layer is placed at y=-64

## Changes in 21w43a

-   The Priority Updates video setting has been renamed to Chunk Builder
-   Reduced the amount of flooded caves near river and ocean coastlines
-   Aquifer water levels change less often, so you'll more often have larger areas with the same water level. This means slightly fewer underground waterfalls and slightly easier underground boat travel
-   Lava aquifers are slightly less common
-   Restricted Big Dripleaf placement to Clay, Grass, Dirt, Farmland, Moss, Rooted Dirt, Podzol and Mycelium

## Technical Changes in 21w43a

-   Some internal details of block and fluid ticking have been changed to improve save times. While it should behave exactly as it was, it might be a good time to test your redstone contraptions (on a copy of a world or with a backup, of course)
-   The Chunk format has been updated

### World Data: Chunk Format

-   Removed chunk's `Level` and moved everything it contained up
-   Chunk's `Level.Entities` has moved to `entities`
-   Chunk's `Level.TileEntities` has moved to `block_entities`
-   Chunk's `Level.TileTicks` and `Level.ToBeTicked` have moved to `block_ticks`
-   Chunk's `Level.LiquidTicks` and `Level.LiquidsToBeTicked` have moved to `fluid_ticks`
-   Chunk's `Level.Sections` has moved to `sections`
-   Chunk's `Level.Structures` has moved to `structures`
-   Chunk's `Level.Structures.Starts` has moved to `structures.starts`
-   Chunk's `Level.Sections[].BlockStates` and `Level.Sections[].Palette` have moved to a container structure in `sections[].block_states`
-   Chunk's `Level.Biomes` are now paletted and live in a similar container structure in `sections[].biomes`
-   Added `yPos` the minimum section y position in the chunk
-   Added `below_zero_retrogen` containing data to support below zero generation
-   Added `blending_data` containing data to support blending new world generation with existing chunks

## Fixed bugs in 21w43a

-   [MC-131930](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-131930) Deep warm ocean generates without coral and sea pickles
-   [MC-156616](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-156616) Badlands layers not generating properly
-   [MC-217379](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-217379) Pufferfish don't spawn in deep warm ocean

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w42a

It's time for a musical snapshot! We're now introducing new music for Caves & Cliffs: Part II. This time around we have a bunch of new tracks composed by the talented Lena Raine and Kumi Tanioka. These tracks are also available on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/7yQIrNTf3pBu0FdyAJqTqb?si=CC31NZyIQrOl-MNVCNYYkQ) for you to listen to, and they will soon be available on other services such as Apple Music and YouTube as well.

This snapshot also includes a few additional tweaks, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

**We still highly recommend backing up your world before loading it in this snapshot.**

## New Features in 21w42a

-   Added world autosave indicator for single-player worlds

### Music

-   Added new music by Lena Raine and Kumi Tanioka to the Overworld (when playing in survival mode) and the main menu

## Changes in 21w42a

-   World spawn selection algorithm has been reworked, now spawns player according to climate parameters
-   World generation tweaks

### World Generation

-   Lava springs can generate in mountains and snowy terrain

-   Badlands gold generates higher up

## Technical Changes in 21w42a

-   Replaced `light` and `barrier` particles with `block_marker`

### Particles

#### `block_marker`

-   Renders with texture declared in `particle` slot for model assigned to configured block state
-   Summoned with same syntax as `block` particle (i.e. `block_marker wheat[age=2]`)

## Bugs fixed in 21w42a

-   [MC-129912](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-129912) Player no longer spawned at highest level at world spawn

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w41a

Have a random snapshot! In this snapshot, we've replaced the random number generator used for world generation, which makes more seeds come out as different... but it also moves everything around in the world, so expect all worlds to look different in this snapshot.

Another thing that we've replaced is the cubemap - the spinning image that you see behind the main menu. It's pretty sweet!

Also, in case you missed it, we're having our [annual Minecraft Live event](https://www.minecraft.net/live) this Saturday. Make sure to check that out!

**We still highly recommend backing up your world before loading it in this snapshot.**

## Changes in 21w41a

-   The main menu backdrop now shows a Caves & Cliffs: Part II scene
-   Badlands mineshafts generate higher up
-   Geodes now only generate up to height 30 and their rarity has been adjusted to match 1.17 levels
-   The angle at which sprinting against a block does not break your sprint has been increased a bit

## Technical Changes in 21w41a

-   Changed the prioritization order of the chunk rendering pipeline
    -   Unrendered chunk holes in the world should not appear anymore while flying fast with high render distance
-   Server classes are now signed
-   New random number generator for Overworld generation

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w39a

Time for an Advanced snapshot! In this snapshot, you can also open worlds from previous versions again - with one big warning! The blending technology we intend to introduce for Caves & Cliffs: Part II is not yet available. If you open an old world in this snapshot it will be upgraded with air under the current bottom of the world and visible chunk borders to new areas.

**We highly recommend backing up your world before loading it in this snapshot.**

## New Features in 21w39a

-   Added Caves & Cliffs: Part II Advancements

### Advancements

-   Added "Caves & Cliffs" for falling from top to bottom of the Overworld
-   Added "Feels like home" for riding strider on lava for 50 blocks in the Overworld
-   Added "Star Trader" for trading with a villager at the build height limit
-   Added "Sound of Music" for playing music with a jukebox in a Meadow biome

## Changes in 21w39a

-   Tweaked peaks to make small mountains look more like proper jagged mountain peaks instead of flat hilly mounds
-   The lone trees in Meadows now always contain a bee nest
-   Drowned can spawn in aquifers inside dripstone caves
-   Zombies don't spawn in dripstone caves
-   Buried treasure chests can now contain water breathing potions
-   Changed default brightness to 50
-   Redesigned how effects look in the inventory screen, to allow them to show even with recipe book open

### Effects

-   Your list of effects are now shown to the right of your inventory, instead of the left side
-   When the inventory effects list is visible, it will be hidden from the game view to reduce screen clutter
-   There's now two modes of seeing the effect list: compact and classic
    -   Classic is the pre-existing list of effects, one after another
    -   Compact is a single icon for each effect, suitable for small screen estate
-   The game will automatically switch between the two looks to suit the available screen estate (including having the recipe book open)

## Technical Changes in 21w39a

-   Added `fall_from_height` and `ride_entity_distance` advancement triggers
-   Changed `nether_travel` to match other similar triggers
-   Added new loot table function `set_potion`
-   Changes to the on-disk chunk format
-   Resource pack format has been increased to 8
-   Standalone `server.jar` now bundles contains individual libraries instead of being flat archive

### Advancements

#### New triggers

##### `fall_from_height`

-   Triggered when a player lands after falling
-   Conditions:
    -   `player` - a player for which this trigger runs
    -   `start_position` - location predicate for last position before falling started
    -   `distance` - predicate for distance between `start_position` and player

##### `ride_entity_in_lava`

-   Triggered for every tick when player rides in lava
-   Conditions
    -   `player` - a player for which this trigger runs
    -   `start_position` - position where riding started (first tick on lava)
    -   `distance` - predicate for distance between `start_position` and player

#### Changed triggers

##### `nether_travel`

-   `entered` condition renamed to `start_position`
-   `exited` has been removed, since it was identical to `player.location`

### Loot Tables

#### New functions

##### `set_potion`

Sets `Potion` tag on any item

###### Parameters:

-   `id` - potion id

### World Data: Chunk Format

-   Chunk's `Level.Sections[].BlockStates` & `Level.Sections[].Palette` have moved to a container structure in `Level.Sections[].block_states`
-   Chunk's `Level.Biomes` are now paletted and live in a similar container structure in `Level.Sections[].biomes`
-   Chunk's `Level.CarvingMasks[]` is now `long[]` instead of `byte[]`

### Resource Pack format

-   `minecraft/textures/gui/container/inventory.png` now contains an extra sprite for a thin-layout version of the effect list in the inventory

### Server bundling

-   `server.jar` now bundles individual libraries instead of merging all the files into single archive
-   This change is meant to solve certain problems related to Java modules
-   On startup, `server.jar` will unpack libraries into directory configured by `bundlerRepoDir` (default: working directory)
-   To run different main class than server, use `bundlerMainClass` property (for example `java -DbundlerMainClass=net.minecraft.data.Main -jar server.jar --reports`) or unpack jar manually and use contents of `META-INF/classpath-joined` for command line

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w38a

The second Caves & Cliffs: Part II snapshot is here! This snapshot mostly contains tweaks and bug fixes, but there are also some new technical additions such as a separate simulation distance slider and an increased thread count (no I'm not talking about the fancy sheets you're thinking about buying).

Oh, and you also seemed to enjoy Strongholds quite a lot, so we decided to add them back into the game. Enjoy!

## Known Issues in 21w38a

-   This snapshot is still not compatible with older worlds - to play in this snapshot, you will have to create a new world
-   World saving can sometimes take a very long time - if you see the world stop moving for a time, this is why

## Changes in 21w38a

-   Sprinting is no longer reduced to walking when gently brushing your sleeve against a wall
-   Fixes for the distribution of ores

### Ore distribution

-   Copper ore generates up to y 95 (as originally designed)
-   Increased the amount of copper
-   Lapis lazuli generates in blobs, like other ores (instead of spread out)

### Sprinting

-   Previously, any collision with a block would reduce sprinting to walking. Now, for very minor angles of collision with a block, players retain their sprint. For larger angles of collision, the old behavior is retained.

## Technical Changes in 21w38a

-   A new setting has been added: "Simulation distance"
-   Maximum amount of background threads increased
-   Added telemetry for world loading

### Simulation distance setting

-   Entities will not be updated outside of simulation distance.
-   Allows higher render distance with less CPU load.
-   A new slider in video settings on the client.
-   A new `simulation-distance` property in dedicated server properties.
-   We will continue working on it with a goal of simulation distance also affecting block and fluid ticking.

### Maximum amount of background threads increased

Various background tasks including worldgen are executed on a background thread pool. Its size equals the amount of available CPU threads minus one, but there was an upper limit of 7. Now this upper limit is 255. This should help higher-end machines with world-gen performance.

The upper limit can be overridden by `max.bg.threads` Java system property, for example when running multiple servers on a single machine.

### Telemetry

In this release, we are re-introducing diagnostic tracking, which was part of Minecraft: Java Edition until 2018. We are bringing it back to better understand our players and to improve their experience. Specifically, we hope to ensure stronger performance for the extremely heavy world generation in the second part of the Caves & Cliffs update later this year.

In practice, this can mean identifying technical pain points in the game, like how less powerful hardware performs in high-complexity terrain. This information will also help us prioritize various aspects of development, balance game features (by learning, for instance, that the goats are pushing every single player off the cliffs) and lend new Minecrafters a helping hand (after realizing that many of them get stuck at the same points). All data is treated according to GDPR and CCPA best practices and is used to develop a better-performing and generally more enjoyable Minecraft: Java Edition.

At this point the only implemented event is world load.

#### World Load event

-   Sent when loading singleplayer world or connecting to multiplayer server
-   Contains following information:
    -   launcher identifier
    -   user identitifer (XUID)
    -   client session id (changes on restart)
    -   world session id (changes per world load, to be reused for later events)
    -   game version
    -   operating system name and version
    -   Java runtime version
    -   if client or server is modded (same information as on crash logs)
    -   server type (single player, Realms or other)
    -   game mode

## Bugs fixed in 21w38a

-   [MC-44055](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-44055) Game fails to switch the audio output from one device to another after the game has started (from title screen)
-   [MC-236611](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-236611) No sound for using shears on weeping, twisting, cave vines or kelp

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w37a

Marvellous mountains and colossal caves, this snapshot has it all! Today we're bringing the Overworld revamp to regular snapshots. If you've been playing or checking out the experimental snapshots that we've been releasing, you should be familiar with what you're seeing. If not, you're in for a treat!

Since we're extending the world height, and there are quite a few under-the-hood changes, we've been keeping an eye on how the game is running, and there are still improvements to be made. However, we would still appreciate it if you would be able to take this survey so that we can understand how you perceive the performance of this snapshot.

It should also be noted that there is currently no upgrade path for existing worlds in this snapshot. This means that you can only create new worlds in this snapshot, and not play on any of your existing worlds. We're working on this and you should be able to play on your existing worlds in an upcoming snapshot not too far in the future.

All of this said, we hope that you have a great time checking out these new additions. Watch your feet so that you don't fall into a very deep hole, and make sure you don't get punted off a mountain by a goat that's just minding its own business.

Happy mining!

## New Features in 21w37a

-   Added noise caves and aquifers
-   Added Dripstone Caves underground biome
-   Added Grove biome
-   Added Lofty peaks biome
-   Added Lush Caves underground biome
-   Added Meadow biome
-   Added Snowcapped peaks biome
-   Added Snowy slopes biome
-   Added Stony peaks biome
-   New ore distribution and large ore veins
-   Overworld build and generation limits have been expanded

### Blocks

-   Enchanting Tables now emit a low amount of light
-   Using shears on the tip of a Cave Vine, Twisting Vine, Weeping Wine or Kelp now causes it to stop growing

### Dripstone Caves biome

-   Contains plenty of Pointed Dripstone and Dripstone Block on the floors and ceilings, and small pools of water
-   In some places you'll find larger stalagmites, stalactites, and columns built from Dripstone Blocks
-   Contains extra copper ore

### Grove

-   Snowy terrain with big spruce trees and powder snow traps. Might want to wear leather boots!
-   Tends to generate on high-altitude terrain beneath mountain peaks or on hilltops.
-   Spawns wolfs, rabbits, and foxes.

### Large ore veins

-   Ore veins are large, rare, snake-like underground ore formations
-   Copper veins form between y 0 and y 50 and are mixed with Granite
-   Iron veins form below y -60 and y -8 and are mixed with Tuff

### Lofty peaks

-   Dramatic jagged mountain peaks with snow and stone
-   Spawns goats

### Lush Caves biome

-   Moss covers the floors and ceilings
-   Spore Blossoms grow from the ceiling and drip particles
-   Contains Clay pools with Dripleaf plants growing out of them
-   Contains Azalea Bushes and Flowering Azalea Bushes
-   The Azalea Tree loves to have its roots in Lush Caves, so if you find an Azalea Tree (either overground or in a cave) you know there is a Lush Cave beneath you
-   Cave Vines with Glow Berries grow from the ceiling and light up the caves

### Meadow biome

-   Large grassy and flowery biome that tends to generate high up on plateaus or next to large mountain ranges.
-   Sometimes contains a lone tall oak or birch tree, often with a bee nest.
-   Think Sound of Music!
-   Spawns donkeys, rabbits, and sheep.

### Mob Spawning

-   Monsters now only spawn in places where the light from blocks is 0 (sky light still prevents spawning like before)
-   Fixed an issue where players in multiplayer can face more or far fewer enemies than intended, particularly when other players are flying

### New ore distribution

-   Changed ore generation to match the new world height, and to add more strategy to mining.
-   There is no longer a single y level that is best for all ores, you need to make tradeoffs.
-   Iron ore generates below y 72, with a strong bias towards y 16.
-   Iron ore also generates above 112, with more iron ore as you go higher.
-   Copper ore generates between y 0 and y 96, with a strong bias towards y 48.
-   Copper ore generates in larger amounts in dripstone caves biome.
-   Lapis lazuli generates below y 64, with a strong bias towards y 0. However, Lapis below y -32 or above y 32 cannot generate exposed to air. It will either be buried or inside water.
-   Coal generates above y 0, with a strong bias towards y 96 and above.
-   Coal has reduced air exposure, so you will find more coal buried or underwater than exposed to air.
-   Gold generates below y 32, with a strong bias towards y -16.
-   Extra gold can (still) be found in badlands biomes.
-   Redstone ore generates below y 16. Redstone ore generation gradually increases as you go below y -32 and further down.
-   Diamond generates below y 16, with more diamond the lower you go.
-   Diamonds have reduced air exposure, so you will find more diamond buried or underwater than exposed to air.

### Noise caves and Aquifers

-   Noise caves are a new way of generating caves, providing more natural variety. They can get really huge sometimes! Noise caves come in three flavors:
    -   Cheese caves. Like the holes in swiss cheese. These often form caverns of various size
    -   Spaghetti caves. Long squiggly tunnels, sometimes wide like tagliatelle
    -   Noodle caves. Thinner, squigglier, and more claustrophobic variant of spaghetti caves
-   No, they aren't loud. The "noise" part of noise caves is a technical term and has nothing to do with sound
-   The old cave carvers and canyons still generate, combining with the noise caves to form interesting cave systems
-   As with carvers, when noise caves intersect the surface they form cave entrances
-   An aquifer is an area with local water level, independent of sea level. Aquifers are used during world generation to generate bodies of water inside noise caves. This sometimes results in large underground lakes! They can also form inside mountains and on the surface.
-   Aquifers below y0 will sometimes be lava aquifers instead of water aquifers
-   Magma Blocks sometimes generates at the bottom of underground bodies of water
-   Underwater cave carvers and underwater canyons have been removed, since aquifers are used to generate water in caves instead

### Options

-   Added an accessibility option to stop the sky flashing during thunderstorms
-   Added an option to specify the audio device used by the game
-   Added "Toggle Sprint" and "Toggle Sneak" to the Controls settings
-   Moved Keybinds out to their own settings screen, accessible from Controls

### Snowcapped peaks

-   Smooth mountain peaks with ice and snow
-   Spawns goats and yeti. No actually just goats.

### Snowy slopes

-   Very snowy terrain that can hide powder snow traps. Might want to wear leather boots!
-   Tends to generate on high-altitude terrain beneath mountain peaks or on hilltops.
-   Spawns rabbits and goats.

### Stony peaks

-   Stony mountain peaks that may be jagged or smooth
-   Spawns goats
-   Contains strips of calcite sometimes

### World generation

-   Generation range and build limits have been expanded by 64 blocks up and 64 blocks down, to a total range of 384 blocks
-   Underground features, structures, and caves generate all the way down to y-64
-   Exception: Diorite and Granite and Andesite and Dirt don't generate below y0
-   Tweaked size and positioning of Diorite, Andesite & Granite generation
-   Dripstone clusters can no longer be found in normal caves, only in dripstone caves biome
-   Starting from y0 and below deepslate gradually replaces all stone
-   Deepslate blobs no longer generate above y0
-   The terrain shape and elevation varies dramatically, indepedently from biomes. For example, forests and deserts could form up on a hill without needing a special biome just for that
-   Less diorite/granite/andesite generates above y 60
-   Strips of gravel can generate in stony shores
-   Swamp trees can grow in water 2 blocks deep (instead of just 1 block deep)

## Changes in 21w37a

-   Illagers (Vindicator, Pillager, Evoker) no longer attack baby villagers
-   Axolotls now only spawn in lush caves
-   Axolotls now have their own, separate, mob cap
-   Raised the cloud level from 128 to 192

## Technical Changes in 21w37a

-   Replaced the clientbound chunk update network packet with another one which additionally contains light update data. Separate light update packet still exists and is sent when light update happens without chunk update.
-   View distance now causes chunks to load cylindrically around players instead of in a square
-   Information about the world generation noise is now displayed on the debug screen
-   Added `illageralt`, rune-like font from Minecraft Dungeons (currently only usable via commands)
-   Added startup option `--jfrProfile` and command `jfr` to start profiling with Java FlightRecorder as well as a few custom events.
-   Loot table functions `set_contents` and `set_loot_table` now require `type` field with valid block entity type
-   Worlds last saved before Minecraft 1.2 ("pre-anvil") no longer can be opened directly
-   Data pack format has been increased to 8
-   New video setting "Priority updates".
-   Removed length limits for scoreboard, score holder and team names
-   Mob spawners can now override light checks for spawning

### JFR Profiling

#### Custom events

-   `minecraft.ServerTickTime`: sampling event exposing average server tick times at one second intervals
-   `minecraft.ChunkGeneration`: time taken to generate individual chunk stages
-   `minecraft.PacketRead | minecraft.PacketSent`: network traffic
-   `minecraft.WorldLoadFinishedEvent`: initial world loading duration

#### Ending a profiling run

The run will then be stopped either by:

-   shutting down the JVM
-   `jfr stop` in-game command
-   `jcmd` CLI tool

#### Overview

Java Flight Recorder ([https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/328](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/328)) is the internal JVM profiling tool bundled with the Java Runtime to analyze performance and runtime characteristics. It's a useful tool for exposing internal JVM performance metrics as well as custom metrics that can be monitored or analyzed using any stock Java profiler or monitoring agents.

#### Reports

A summary JSON report is written both to the log file and in the debug folder accompanied by a `.jfr` recording ready to be analyzed in i.e JMC [https://github.com/openjdk/jmc](https://github.com/openjdk/jmc) or any other profiler tool supporting the format.

#### Starting a profiling run

A profiling run can be started using any of the following alternatives:

-   `--jfrProfile` startup flag when starting a Minecraft server or client
-   `jfr start` in-game command
-   Regular Java CLI tools such as `jcmd`

### Loot tables

#### Changed functions

##### `set_contents`, `set_loot_table`

Added new mandatory field `type`. This type will be written into `BlockEntityTag.id`, to make sure this tag can be correctly migrated between versions

### Old world conversion

-   Worlds last saved before Minecraft 1.2 ("pre-anvil") now require conversion in a previous version of a game to be able to be opened
-   Conversion works best in versions 1.6.4 and before - worlds opened for the first time in later versions will have incorrect biome information

### Priority update setting

-   This setting determines which chunks sections are updated synchronously during a single frame.
-   The most conservative option "nearby" corresponds to the state before the update.
-   The new options "by player" and "none" significantly reduce stutters when placing or removing blocks (especially light sources), but can potentially cause rare visually noticeable delays in world updates.

### Spawner data changes

-   Spawners now support the `custom_spawn_rules` NBT in the `SpawnData` field and the `SpawnPotentials` list
-   `custom_spawn_rules` currently may contain fields `block_light_limit` and `sky_light_limit` - both are integer ranges with fields `min_inclusive` and `max_inclusive`
-   To make `SpawnPotentials` format similar to other weighted lists, structure was changed to `{weight: <int>, data: <previous contents without 'Weight', 'Entity' renamed to 'entity'>}`
-   To accomodate that change, previous contents of `SpawnData` were moved to `SpawnData.entity` (making format of that field same as elements of `SpawnPotentials.data`)

Example:

    SpawnData: {
        entity: {
            id: "minecraft:cow"
        },
        custom_spawn_rules: {
              sky_light_limit: {min_inclusive: 10, max_inclusive: 15}
        },
    }
    SpawnPotentials: [
      {
        data: {
          custom_spawn_rules: {
              block_light_limit: {min_inclusive: 0, max_inclusive: 15}
          },
          entity: {id: "minecraft:pig"},
        },
        weight: 2
      },
      {
        data: {
          custom_spawn_rules: {
              block_light_limit: {min_inclusive: 5, max_inclusive: 10},
              sky_light_limit: {min_inclusive: 10, max_inclusive: 15}
          },
          entity: {id: "minecraft:panda"}
        },
        weight: 1
      }
    ]

## Technical changes in 1.17 Pre-release 1

-   Added `started_riding`, `lightning_strike` and `using_item` advancement triggers
-   Added `source` condition to `effects_changed` trigger
-   Added `lightning_bolt` sub-predicate

-   perf start/stop command on dedicated servers will now generate and persist server performance metrics

### Advancements

#### New triggers

##### `started_riding`

-   Triggered when player starts riding a vehicle or entity starts riding vehicle currently ridden by player
-   Conditions:
    -   `player` - either a player that started riding or one of boat passengers

##### `lightning_strike`

-   Triggered when lighting finishes (i.e. entity disappears)
-   Triggers for any player on server
-   Conditions
    -   `player` - player for which this trigger runs
    -   `lightning` - predicate for lightning entity
    -   `bystander` - predicate for one of the entities in certain area around strike not hurt by it

##### `using_item`

-   Triggered for every tick of using items (like crossbows, spyglass, fishing rods, etc)
-   Conditions
    -   `player` - players that uses item
    -   `item` - item being used

#### Changed triggers

##### `effects_changed`

-   Added `source` triggers that matches entity that triggered the change
-   Might be empty when:
    -   there is no entity (for example, effect gained from beacon)
    -   the effect is self-applied
    -   effect is removed

##### Item predicate

-   `item` field expended to `items`, now accepting array of item types

##### Block predicate

-   `block` field expended to `blocks`, now accepting array of block types

-   `stepping_on` - location predicate for block entity is currently standing on
-   `lightning_bolt` - sub-predicate valid only for lightning bolt entity

##### Player predicate

-   `looking_at` - entity currently viewed by player
    -   uses same line-of-sight rules as attacking mobs
    -   actual detection radius might be changed in future

#### Lightning bolt

-   `blocks_set_on_fire` - range check for of blocks set on fire by this entity
-   `entity_struck` - predicate for entities struck by this lightning (if present, must match one or more)

### Performance metrics reporting

These will be saved to a zip file in `debug/profiling/<yyyy-MM-dd_HH.mm.ss-[levelname]-[version]>.zip` and could be used for performance regression analysis if included in bug reports.

The exact metrics, output format, and names are susceptible to change between versions. Our plan is to continue iterating on which metrics to capture.

#### Client F3+L shortcut

Pressing F3+L while in the game will start a recording for 10 seconds capturing metrics such as tick durations, used heap sizes and other more detailed stats.

Pressing F3+L before the 10-second limit will end the recording early.

This shortcut is always available to clients, even on multi-player servers where it will record client-side performance.

#### Dedicated Server perf start/stop command

`perf start` will start a recording for 10 seconds capturing metrics such as tick durations, used heap sizes and other more detailed stats.

`perf stop` before the 10-second limit will end the recording early.

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w19a

Now with twice as much Java version.

Starting with this snapshot, Candles, Bundles, and Sculk Sensors are only accessible through commands. We do not feel that they are at the quality we want for Part 1 of the Caves & Cliffs release. To keep trying these features out in survival mode, use the Preview data pack!

## Changes in 21w19a

-   The maximum length of item names in the anvil UI has been increased from 35 to 50
-   Made geodes significantly rarer
-   Unfinished items (Sculk Sensor, Bundle and Candles) have been removed from the creative inventory
-   Recipes for unfinished items (Bundle, Candles) have been removed

## Changes to the Caves & Cliffs Preview

Download the [updated datapack](https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/a6b56d6f14869646eb8d399e99a0149bdd954490/CavesAndCliffsPreview.zip).

-   The pack now includes recipes related to bundles and candles

## Technical changes in 21w19a

-   Upgraded to Java 16
-   Added `mineable/axe`, `mineable/hoe`, `mineable/pickaxe` and `mineable/shovel` block tags. Blocks with these tags can be destroyed more quickly with the matching tool.
-   Added `needs_stone_tool`, `needs_iron_tool` and `needs_diamond_tool` block tags. If a block requires the correct tool to drop, these tags determine which tier of that tool is required.
-   Changed the syntax of the `/item` command

### Java 16

Minecraft now uses a more recent version of Java. If you are using a default setup the Launcher will download and install the correct version. If you are using a custom Java setup or a third-party launcher, you will need to ensure that your Java installation is version 16 or above.

### Item command

New syntax:

-   `/item replace <target> with <item stack> [<count>]` - same as old `replaceitem`
-   `/item replace <target> from <source> [<modifier>]` - copies item for source to target(s), optionally applying modifier
-   `/item modify <target> <modifier>` - modifies item (without copying)

For example, `/item replace block ~ ~ ~ container.0 from entity @s enderchest.0` will copy first item from player's enderchest to first slot of container player is currently standing on.

## Bugs fixed in 21w19a

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w18a

Hey-hoo! Will you look at that! It's Wednesday once again, which means we get to share updates about all the Minecraft bits and bobs. This week, we're distributing an ore distribution Snapshot for all you lovely Snapshot connoisseurs to feast upon. Enjoy!

## Changes in 21w18a

-   Infested Blocks are no longer instantly destroyed, and instead have half the destroy time of their non-infested counterpart.
-   Screaming goats will use their ram attack more often than other goats will

## Changes to the Caves & Cliffs Preview

-   Reduced copper spawning a bit, to compensate for large ore veins
-   Large ore veins are slightly more rare and slightly smaller on average. But the size varies a lot so you can still find huge ones.
-   Increased chance of finding raw ore blocks in ore veins
-   Cave carvers generate below y 0 in ocean biomes (they didn't before, it was an accident)
-   Increased the minimum size of noodle caves and carvers, to make them easier to traverse and less likely to break up into fragments.
-   Noodle caves no longer generate above y 30, so the surface should be less riddled with holes.
-   Removed deepslate blobs above y 0
-   Extended the vertical range of the smaller blobs of iron ore, to make it possible to find iron in caves near the surface.
-   Slightly reduced the amount of normal-sized iron blobs, to compensate for large ore veins and the increased range of smaller blobs.

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w16a

Snapshot 21w16a introduces some changes to azaleas and dripstone. On top of that, we've tweaked the textures of raw ores. There are also a few additions to the Caves & Cliffs preview datapack.

## New Features in 21w16a

-   Azalea and Flowering Azalea can now be bonemealed to get an Azalea Trees
-   Added dripstone growth

### Dripstone growth

-   If a stalactite is hanging from a dripstone block with a water source above, it will slowly grow both the stalactite from above and a stalagmite from below
-   Growth speed is random but very slow, a single growth step can take several minecraft days
-   A stalactite will only grow up to 7 blocks long
-   A stalactite will only cause stalagmite growth if the floor or stalagmite below is within 10 blocks
-   If the stalactite tip is inside water it won't drip, and therefore won't trigger any growth
-   If the stalagmite tip is inside water it won't receive drops, and therefore won't be grown by a dripping stalactite. Same thing if there is any fluid between the two tips
-   A stalagmite or stalactite will never grow into a fluid

## Changes in 21w16a

-   Tweaked the texture of raw ores and raw ore blocks

-   Aquifers below height 0 will sometimes be lava aquifers instead of water aquifers
-   Ore veins can now spawn underground

### Ore veins

-   Ore veins are large, rare, snake-like underground ore formations
-   Copper veins form above height 0 and are mixed with granite
-   Iron veins form below height 0 and are mixed with tuff

## Technical Changes in 21w16a

-   Users who previously permanently declined server resource packs will now still be shown the pack prompt if the pack is mandatory (instead of being immediately disconnected)
-   The statistic for play time has been renamed to `play_time`
-   There is now a statistic for "Time with World Open" (`total_world_time`) that also includes time when the game was paused

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w15a

In today’s snapshot, we’re making a few needed changes that directly relate to our [recent announcement](https://www.minecraft.net/article/a-caves---cliffs-announcement). If you haven’t yet read it, we strongly recommend you do. You can also check out [this Caves & Cliffs video](https://youtu.be/6YgKUZnUyak) from Agnes and Henrik to learn more about our plans for the update.

Even though some features will be released later than we’d planned, you can still try them out through a separate data pack. More information, as well as our latest tweaks, can be found here below.

## Caves & Cliffs World Generation

The riskier and technically more complex world generation changes for the Caves & Cliffs update will be shipped in a later update and have been switched off in this snapshot. This means:

-   World height has been switched back to the 1.16 levels
-   Noise caves and aquifers have been switched off
-   Cave and ravine carvers have been returned to their old settings
-   Crack carvers have been switched off
-   Ore distribution has been returned to the 1.16 setup
-   Copper now generates between the bottom of the world and height 192, being most common around height 96
-   Tuff now generates in blobs between heights 0 and 16
-   Worlds created in snapshot 21w05b or any earlier version can now once again be opened
-   Worlds created in any version between snapshot 21w06a and 21w14a can no longer be opened

### The Caves & Cliffs Prototype Data Pack

You can still try out the world generation for the later update using a datapack which activates the changes as an experimental custom world:

-   [Download the data pack](https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/643b1f8f7f71c74ffc913e8572f52fd5bca88282/CavesAndCliffsPreview.zip)
-   Launch the game, go to the "Create New World" screen, and click the “Data Packs” button
-   Drag the downloaded zip file onto the Minecraft window
-   The game will ask you if you want to add the data pack – click “Yes”
-   Click the play arrow on the data pack that just appeared in the list – this will move it to the list on the right-hand side of the screen
-   Click the "Done" button and continue creating your world as normal

Keep in mind that the world you create with the data pack will be flagged as experimental by the game, and such worlds are not guaranteed to work in future versions. Also, please note that you can’t add data packs that change the world generation to existing worlds, so you must create a new world to access the experimental features.

## New Features in 21w15a

![Minecraft Snapshot 21w15a Texture Comparison](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/images/snapshot-21w15a-ore-texture-comparison.png) New raw ore textures in snapshot 21w15a. [Click here](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/snapshot21w15aoretexturecomparisonfull.png) for a link to the full resolution image.

### Building Blocks tab

-   All ores have been reordered to be in the same location in the creative inventory.
-   Compact forms of raw and refined underground materials have been reordered.

## Technical Changes in 21w15a

-   Added the Marker entity
-   Added `/debug function`
-   `selector` and `nbt` chat components can now configure separators between elements
-   Servers can now customize a message to display when prompting players about custom resource packs

### Markers

Markers are a new type of entity meant for custom use cases like map making and data packs.

-   Only exist on the server side, are never sent to clients
-   Do not do any updates of their own
-   Have a `data` compound field that can contain any data

### `/debug function`

New debug subcommand executes command with same syntax as function

-   Every executed command, message (even if it would be normally invisible), result or error is stored to file
-   Cannot be run from inside functions

### Chat component separators

-   Components that print lists of names, like `selector` or `nbt` can now override separator (`", "` by default) with `separator` element
-   Examples:
    -   `{"selector": "@e[type=chicken]", "separator": "|"}`
    -   `{"nbt": "CustomName", "entity": "@e[type=chicken]", "interpret": true, "separator": {"text": "*", "color": "red"}}`

### Custom server resource packs

When `require-resource-pack` is used in `server.properties`, there's now an option for servers to add a custom message.

-   A dedicated server can configure additional message to be shown on resource pack prompt (`resource-pack-prompt` in `server.properties`, expects chat component syntax, can contain multiple lines)

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w14a

A new snapshot is ready to be served, although somewhat… raw. Gordon Ramsey would be furious. Please don’t tell him, we don’t want to be called donuts. :(

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w11a

An absolutely shocking snapshot arrives! This snapshot adds some new functionality to Copper, some general tweaks, a fancy new way of getting performance metrics, and a bunch of bugfixes.

Happy mining!

## New Features in 21w11a

-   Lightning rods can now, for the very first time ever, be waterlogged
-   New functionality for applying and removing wax from copper
-   Bonemealing rooted dirt now grows hanging roots underneath

### Waxing Copper and Oxidization

-   Right click with honeycomb on copper blocks to wax them
-   Use honeycomb in a dispenser to wax copper blocks
-   Axes can scrape off wax and oxidation of copper blocks
-   Lightning strike hitting copper will clean its oxidation

## Changes in 21w11a

-   Waxed copper blocks can be crafted into 4 copper ingots
-   Tweaked the cave sizes
-   Slightly increased the frequency of diamond ore blobs
-   Hanging roots block now renders randomly offset
-   Breaking a Big Dripleaf stem now drops a Big Dripleaf block
-   Moss blocks can be crafted with cobblestone or stone bricks to make the mossy versions of those blocks
-   The facing direction of Small Dripleaf blocks is now determined by which direction the player is facing when placing it
-   Fully-grown Amethyst Clusters now drop 4 Amethyst Shards (or more with Fortune) when mined with a pickaxe, and drop 2 Amethyst Shards when broken by hand, piston, or other means

## Technical Changes in 21w11a

-   Added F3+L shortcut to generate and persist performance metrics from in-game

### In-game client metrics reporting

Pressing F3+L while in the game will start a recording for 10 seconds capturing metrics such as tick durations, used heap sizes and other more detailed stats. These will be saved to a zip file in `debug/profiling/<yyyy-MM-dd_HH.mm.ss>.zip` and could be used for performance regression analysis if included in bug reports.

The exact metrics, output format and names are susceptible to change between versions, and our plan is to continue iterating on which metrics to capture.

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w10a

A truly fabulous snapshot enters the arena! This snapshot brings fundamental changes to our rendering pipeline with the introduction of the brand new tech that is OpenGL Core 3.2. On top of that, we're finally introducing the Lush Caves biome. However, as with the Dripstone Caves, this is only available through creating a custom world.

There's an important note about this snapshot for those of you with older computers: With the introduction of OpenGL Core 3.2 there is a chance Minecraft Java will no longer run on computers that do not meet the [minimum system requirements](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360035131371-Minecraft-Java-Edition-system-requirements-). Computers that meet the [minimum system requirements](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360035131371-Minecraft-Java-Edition-system-requirements-) should not be affected.

## New Features in 21w10a

-   Added Lush Caves underground biome!
-   Added Cracked Deepslate Bricks and Cracked Deepslate Tiles
-   There is now an Infested variant of Deepslate found in the underground
-   While they will not generate in the world by default, Deepslate versions of copper, emerald and coal ores have been added for use by creators of maps and data packs

### Lush caves biome

The Lush Caves underground biome now exists for use in single-biome worlds. It does not yet generate in other world types.

-   Moss covers the floors and ceilings
-   Spore Blossoms grow from the ceiling and drip particles
-   Contains clay pools with dripleaf plants grow out of them
-   Contains azalea bushes and flowering azalea bushes
-   The azalea tree loves to have its roots in lush caves, so if you find an azalea tree (either overground or in a cave) you know there is a lush cave beneath you
-   Cave vines with glow berries grow from the ceiling and light up the caves

## Changes in 21w10a

-   Cobbled Deepslate can now be smelted into Deepslate.
-   Deepslate can now be placed along any axis
-   Lightning rods can now be waterlogged
-   Fossils in the deepest part of the underground generate with deepslate diamond ore instead of coal ore
-   Some ore textures have been updated

### Ore distribution

Overworld ore generation has been tweaked.

-   More emeralds in mountains
-   More lapis
-   Less copper, gold, and redstone
-   Smaller diamond blobs, but slightly more frequent. Less diamond ore overall though
-   Less iron, and it generates lower down
-   Reduced air exposure for coal

## Technical Changes in 21w10a

-   The game now runs using OpenGL 3.2 core profile
-   The maximum size that slimes can be summoned with is now 128
-   The `give` command can only give up to 100 stacks of items at a time (e.g. 6400 stone or 100 iron swords)

### OpenGL

Rendering is now using OpenGL 3.2 core profile. All fixed function rendering has been replaced with shader based rendering.

#### Shaders

Shaders are now included for all supported render states. Any shader except for the `blit` shader can also be replaced in resource packs. For now replacing these shaders is **not officially supported** and the way it works may change in the future.

The current rendering engine uses a system similar to the post processing shader pipeline. There are some differences between both system that cater to the slightly different requirements.

![Comparing old and new ore distribution](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/images/snapshot-21w07a-ore-comparison.png) [Click here](https://i.imgur.com/RH5cgSF.jpg) to view full resolution.

### Visuals

-   Ores without unique shapes have been given new textures for accessibility reasons, so that each ore is distinguishable by shape alone
-   Being the most iconic ore, Diamond Ore texture is staying the same to keep that classic feel maintained
-   Blackstone, Polished Blackstone Bricks, and Cracked Polished Blackstone Bricks have had some minor touch ups

![snapshot-21w07a-texture-comparison](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/images/snapshot-21w07a-texture-comparison.jpg)

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w06a

Hello, new snapshot! Hello, new cave generation!

Today's snapshot introduces a major change to how caves are generated within Minecraft. You could say that we're now introducing the cave part of Caves & Cliffs.

This is only the first step in our underground adventure, so please note that snapshots show features in early development and that there are two notable caveats with this snapshot:

-   You'll be unable to open old worlds in this snapshot as there is currently no upgrade path towards the new world height
-   All caves of the new type between y31 and y63 will be flooded with water

## New Features in 21w06a

-   Added noise caves and aquifers

### Noise caves and Aquifers

-   Noise caves are a new way of generating caves, providing more natural variety. They can get really huge sometimes! Noise caves come in two flavors:
    -   Cheese caves. Like the holes in swiss cheese. These often form caverns of various size.
    -   Spaghetti caves. Long squiggly tunnels, sometimes wide like tagliatelle.
-   No, they aren't loud. The "noise" part of noise caves is a technical term and has nothing to do with sound.
-   The old cave carvers and canyons still generate, combining with the noise caves to form interesting cave systems.
-   As with carvers, when noise caves intersect the surface they form cave entrances.
-   An aquifer is an area with local water level, independent of sea level. Aquifers are used during world generation to generate bodies of water inside noise caves. This sometimes results in large underground lakes!
-   For now, aquifers are only used below y31. This means all noise caves between y31 and sea level (y63) will be flooded with water, and noise cave entrances will essentially be lakes. This will be fixed later.
-   Magma sometimes generates at the bottom of underground bodies of water
-   Underwater cave carvers and underwater canyons have been removed, since aquifers are used to generate water in caves instead.

## Changes in 21w06a

-   Overworld build and generation limits have been expanded
-   Mineshafts adapted to larger caves
-   You can no longer crouch or jump to prevent a big dripleaf from tilting
-   A big dripleaf will now tilt rather than break when hit by a projectile
-   A redstone powered big dripleaf will not tilt (except when hit by a projectile)
-   The textures for hanging roots and small dripleaves have been updated

### World generation

-   Generation range and build limits have been expanded by 64 blocks up and 64 blocks down, to a total range of 384 blocks
-   Underground features, structures, and caves generate all the way down to y -64.

### Mineshaft changes

-   Mineshaft pieces don't generate if they would be fully floating in the air
-   Mineshaft corridors are supported by log pillars when needed
-   No floating cobwebs

## Fixed bugs in 21w06a

-   [MC-214346](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-214346) Big dripleaf can be broken with arrows in spawn protection
-   [MC-213813](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-213813) Small dripleaf can destroy any block

---

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w05b

Snapshot 21w05b is a small snapshot to address a couple of bugs.

## Fixed bugs in 21w05b

-   [MC-203813](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-203813) Copper blocks are named inconsistently
-   [MC-213788](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-213788) The game can randomly freeze

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w05a

## New Features in 21w05a

-   Azalea bushes as well as flowering azaela bushes!
-   Added cave vines and glow berries!
-   Added drip leaves!
-   Added decorative blocks for the upcoming lush caves: hanging roots and rooted dirt!
-   Added moss!
-   Added spore blossom!

### Cave vines and glow berries

-   Cave vines grow down from the ceiling, like weeping vines
-   When they grow they have a chance of producing glow berries
-   Glow berries are a natural light source as well as a food source
-   Foxes eat glow berries
-   Use glow berries to plant new cave vines
-   Bonemealing a cave vine will create glow berries

### Dripleaf

-   Small dripleaf needs moisture, so it grows on clay or underwater
-   Small dripleaf grow into big dripleaf when bonemealed.
-   Big dripleaf grows taller when bonemealed
-   If you stand on a big dripleaf it will tilt after a while and you will fall off
-   You can crouch or jump to prevent a big dripleaf from tilting
-   A tilted big drip leaf will tilt up again after a while
-   The big dripleaf will break when hit by a projectile
-   The wandering trader will sometimes sell small dripleaf plants

### Moss

-   Two new decorative blocks: Moss block and moss carpet
-   Moss carpet can be crafted from moss blocks

### Spore blossom

-   A beautiful large flower placed on ceilings
-   Particles drip from it

## Changes in 21w05a

-   The stonecutter can be used to craft the different copper block variants
-   The stages of copper oxidization are now called "Copper Block", "Exposed Copper Block", "Weathered Copper Block" and "Oxidized Copper Block" in sequence of least to most oxidized
-   Drowned now have a chance of dropping a copper ingot, they no longer drop gold ingots
-   Added new sculk sensor events
-   Changes to powder snow

### Sculk Sensor Changes

Added the following game events that the Sculk Sensor reacts to, along with corresponding frequency value:

Vibration Types

Frequency Value

Minecart Moving, Ring Bell, Block Change

6

Drinking Finish, Prime Fuse

7

Mob Interact

8

Equip, Shear, Ravager Roar

9

Entity Place

12

Entity Killed

13

Shulker Close

14

Shulker Open

15

-   `Block Change` is for when player or dispenser action has changed a block. Example: cake slice being eaten.
-   `Mob Interact` is for specific mob interaction events that cause vibrations.
-   `Prime Fuse` is for both TNT and Creepers.

### Powder Snow changes

-   Flaming arrows now get extinguished when they collide with Powder Snow
-   Skeletons now convert to Strays when frozen
-   Powder snow is now pushable by pistons and sticky pistons
-   Foxes can now walk on top of powder snow without falling in

## Technical Changes in 21w05a

-   Improved performance when using many overrides on an item model
-   Copper oxidization is now a random tick effect and thus affected by the randomTickSpeed game rule

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w03a

Today's Caves & Cliffs snapshot is particularly shiny! You could almost say it's glowing... Oh wait, that's a squid.

## New Features in 21w03a

​

-   Added Glow Lichen!
-   Added the Glow Squid!

​

### Glow Lichen

-   A dim light source that generates in caves
-   Use shears to pick it up
-   Use bonemeal to spread it along block surfaces

​

### Glow Squid

Glow squids have been added, but do not yet spawn naturally. You can find spawn eggs for them in the creative inventory.

-   Glow Squids are well-lit and can be seen from even far distances!
-   When killed, Glow Squids drop Glow Ink Sacs
-   Glow Ink Sacs can be used on signs to make the text super visible, even at night! Works with colors!
-   Craft a Glow Item Frame by combining a Glow Ink Sac with an Item Frame in a Crafting Table. Any item in a Glow Item Frame is perfectly illuminated, even at night!
-   Use an Ink Sac on a sign to remove the glow effect
-   Axolotls will attack any Glow Squids they see, so...be careful

​

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w51a

Ready your screenshot buttons and start rehearsing your best "naaaaww"s. The final snapshot of the year enters Minecraft Java, and what better way to end the year than with something that has been on our bucket list for quite a while: the adorable **axolotl**?

We hope you'll end the year on a good note, and the entirety of the Java team wishes you happy holidays.

## New Features in 20w51a

​

-   Added the axolotl!

​

### Axolotl

-   Amphibious!
-   Axolotls currently love tropical fish, though this may change. Tropical fish or tropical fish buckets can be used to mate axolotls
-   Axolotls will swim around with you if you're holding a tropical fish or tropical fish bucket in one of your hands
-   When a player kills a mob that the axolotl was attacking or being attacked by, the axolotl will show its appreciation by granting the player temporary regeneration and removing any mining fatigue effects
-   You can pick up your axolotl in a water bucket and carry it around just like a salmon or cod!
-   Axolotls will always chase after squids and other types of fish
-   Axolotls are skittish, but they will attack Drowned and Guardians if you tempt them with their favorite food - tropical fish!
-   Axolotls do not like it out of water, and will dry up and begin taking damage if they are out of water for longer than 5 minutes
-   An axolotl will not dry up as long as they are in water or rain
-   Sometimes when an axolotl takes damage, it will pretend to be dead so that it stops being attacked
-   There are 4 common varieties and 1 rare variety of axolotl
-   Axolotls do not spawn in the world yet, but you can find spawn eggs for them in the creative inventory

​

## Changes in 20w51a

-   Bundles and shulker box items will now drop their items when destroyed
-   Some changes have been made to Sculk Sensors

​

### Sculk Sensors

-   Eating Start has been removed as an event for a few reasons.
    -   It is inconsistent with our philosophy around vibrations. Mining a block is not considered a vibration because a physical event hasn't happened in the world yet (you can stop mining and the block will revert). This is the same for eating: you can start eating, but then stop and the food reverts as if eating never occurred.
    -   It wasn't widely considered to be a useful event for players to use Sculk Sensors with.
    -   Eating Finish is staying, and will likely be much more useful to Sculk Sensors for this scenario.
-   Walking on wool no longer causes vibrations.
-   Throwing wool as an item onto the ground no longer causes vibrations.
-   Sculk Sensors are now silent while waterlogged.

​

#### Vibration Frequency Changes

As we continue to consider feedback from the community, some changes to the frequency ranges have been made. We expect this to change quite heavily up until release to figure out the most interesting ranges for gameplay, and as always feedback is extremely welcome! Here is the newest table in this snapshot.

## Technical Changes in 20w51a

-   Added gamerule playersSleepingPercentage (100 by default), which sets what percentage of players must sleep to skip the night. Setting to 0 will mean 1 player is always enough to skip the night. Setting above 100 will prevent skipping the night.

​

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w49a

Another snapshot is going out, and this one introduces the Sculk. They're a bit creepy, but don't let that put you off. Pick up some good vibrations!

## New Features in 20w49a

-   Added Dripstone Caves biome
-   Added Sculk Sensors

### Dripstone Caves biome

This biome doesn't generate naturally yet, since it is designed for the upcoming larger caves. However, if you want to see the biome in the current caves you can create a single-biome world with dripstone caves.

-   Contains plenty of Pointed Dripstone on the floors and ceilings, and small pools of water
-   In some places you'll find larger stalagmites, stalactites, and columns built from Dripstone Blocks.

### Sculk Sensors

-   Introducing the bizarre, tendril-filled world of Sculk - prepare for Sculk Sensors to creep you out with their unique ability to detect vibrations nearby.
-   A vibration is anything that causes physical motion; if you are careful, there are some motions that are undetectable to sensors by sneaking.
    -   These sneak-friendly vibrations currently include walking, falling to the ground or throwing/shooting projectiles.
-   Sculk Sensors will not listen to vibrations that are directly created by other Sculk sources.
-   When a vibration is detected, a signal is sent from the source location to the sensor at a speed of 1 game tick per block.
    -   Other vibrations cannot be detected by a sensor when a signal is already travelling to it.
    -   When the signal has arrived, the sensor will be activated for 40 game ticks (approximately 2 seconds).
    -   While activated, the sensor cannot detect other vibrations.
-   Sculk Sensors can detect vibrations in an 8 block radius around it.
-   The efficient tool to mine Sculk Sensors is the Hoe.
-   They can be waterlogged.

#### Redstone Emission

-   Sculk Sensors emit a redstone signal when they are activated.
-   The strength of the redstone signal is inversely proportional to the distance the vibration signal travelled.
    -   This means that the closer the vibration is, the stronger the redstone signal is.
    -   The output is also scaled based on the Sculk Sensor's radius, so it can reach the max redstone signal strength when the vibration is 0 distance away (directly on top of the sensor).

#### Vibration Frequencies

-   Sculk Sensors have a unique interaction with comparators.
-   Each vibration in the game falls under a certain frequency value, and this value can be measured with a comparator.
-   With the right contraption, this allows you to detect when a certain action has occured nearby.

#### Wool Occlusion

-   Wool has a special interaction with Sculk Sensors.
-   If a wool block is in the way of a vibration source, the sensor will not be able to detect it.

#### Technical Tidbits

-   Sculk Sensors have a cooldown period of 1 tick after being placed or after deactivating.
-   During this short cooldown period, it cannot detect vibrations. This is to prevent it from activating itself when a contraption it is powering is being unpowered. Feedback is welcome on this point!

## Changes in 20w49a

-   The Fullness of a bundle now shows up regardless of whether Advanced Tooltips are on or off
-   Stalactites and stalagmites merge if the tips are next to each other, unless you press shift while placing

## Technical Changes in 20w49a

-   A new game event system has been implemented to support Sculk Sensors detecting vibrations.
-   World height related values are now exposed for customized worlds
-   Removed the `max-build-height` server setting
-   Added `occludes_vibration_signals` block tag. Anything in this tag will occlude vibrations, and inherits `wool` tag entries by default
-   New particle types: `vibration` and `dust_color_transition`
-   A new game event system has been implemented to support Sculk Sensors detecting vibrations.

### Game Events

This system has been developed to identify when certain in-world actions are happening in nearby chunks, particularly so the new Sculk Sensor can detect these events as vibrations.

The following is a list of the initial game events:

-   `minecraft:step`
-   `minecraft:swim`
-   `minecraft:flap`
-   `minecraft:elytra_free_fall`
-   `minecraft:hit_ground`
-   `minecraft:splash`
-   `minecraft:projectile_shoot`
-   `minecraft:projectile_land`
-   `minecraft:entity_hit`
-   `minecraft:block_place`
-   `minecraft:block_destroy`
-   `minecraft:fluid_place`
-   `minecraft:fluid_pickup`
-   `minecraft:block_open`
-   `minecraft:block_close`
-   `minecraft:block_switch`
-   `minecraft:block_unswitch`
-   `minecraft:block_attach`
-   `minecraft:block_detach`
-   `minecraft:block_press`
-   `minecraft:block_unpress`
-   `minecraft:container_open`
-   `minecraft:container_close`
-   `minecraft:explode`
-   `minecraft:armor_stand_add_item`
-   `minecraft:wolf_shaking`
-   `minecraft:dispense_fail`
-   `minecraft:fishing_rod_cast`
-   `minecraft:fishing_rod_reel_in`
-   `minecraft:piston_extend`
-   `minecraft:piston_contract`
-   `minecraft:flint_and_steel_use`
-   `minecraft:eating_start`
-   `minecraft:eating_finish`
-   `minecraft:lightning_strike`

#### Tags

There are also game event tags that come with this, and can be modified by data packs. They can be found under `data/minecraft/tags/game_events`.

-   `vibrations` Determines which game events are considered vibrations by the Sculk Sensor. Currently, all added game events are in this tag by default.
-   `ignore_vibrations_stepping_carefully` Which game events should be ignored by the Sculk Sensor when the source of the event is sneaking.

The following game events are in `ignore_vibrations_stepping_carefully` by default:

-   `minecraft:step`
-   `minecraft:hit_ground`
-   `minecraft:projectile_shoot`

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w46a

The snow is snowier than before.

For today’s snapshot, we’ve changed most of the textures introduced in the previous snapshot. This is simply to test if these textures give a better experience in exploring and building. We’re interested to hear what you think. Keep in mind, that some textures might be reverted or changed again in the future

## New Features in 20w46a

-   Added Powder Snow!

### Powder Snow

Snowier snow!

-   Powder Snow is a trap block that causes any entity that walks into it to sink in it
-   You can pick up and place Powder Snow with a bucket
-   Wear leather boots to prevent yourself from sinking into Powder Snow blocks
-   Leave a Cauldron outside in falling snow and it will fill with Powder Snow

#### Freezing

-   Standing in Powder Snow will slowly freeze an entity
-   Once frozen, freeze damage is done every few seconds to the frozen entity
-   Each piece of leather armor warn causes an entity to freeze more slowly
-   Wearing a full set of leather armor prevents freezing entirely

## Changes in 20w46a

-   The range in which a lightning rod attracts lightning has been doubled
-   Copper blocks are now crafted from 4 copper ingots
-   Sky color now varies smoothly when moving between different biomes
-   Buttons that change value (like `Difficulty`) can now be controlled with mouse wheel
-   Clicking on button that changes value while holding shift key changes to previous value
-   "Debug" world type can now be accessed while holding alt key (was shift)

### Textures

Changed a number of the textures for blocks and items introduced in the previous snapshot:

-   Cut Copper
-   Lightning Rod
-   Calcite
-   Amethyst Block
-   Budding Amethyst Block
-   Tinted Glass
-   Candle Item Icons
-   Copper Ingot Item Icon
-   Amethyst Shard Item Icon
-   Bundle Item Icon

## Technical Changes in 20w46a

-   Removed `/replaceitem` command
-   Added `/item` command
-   Added item modifiers, which reuse loot table functions syntax to describe item modification in `/item` command.
-   Data pack version is now 7
-   Loot tables can now access scoreboard values by UUID.
-   Loot table values inside random number generators can now be nested.
-   Default mode of structure blocks is now `Load`. `Data` is now hidden (but can be accessed by clicking mode button while holding alt key)

### Item modifiers

The function part of loot tables can now be defined as separate data pack resource in `item_modifiers` directory. Such files can contain a single function (i.e single JSON object) or an array of functions.

### Commands

#### `item`

Modifies item or block inventory.

This command has three forms:

-   `/item <target> replace <item stack> [<count>]` - same as old `replaceitem`
-   `/item <target> modify <modifier>` - modifies item (without copying).
-   `/item <target> copy <source> [<modifier>]` - copies item for source to target(s), optionally applying modifier

Possible sources and targets:

-   `entity <selector> <slot>`
-   `block <x> <y> <z> <slot>`

For example, `/item block ~ ~ ~ container.0 copy entity @s enderchest.0` will copy first item from player's enderchest to first slot of container player is currently standing on.

### Loot tables

#### New conditions

##### `value_check`

Checks range of value.

Parameters:

-   `value` - see "New value providers" section (currently combination of random generators and score)
-   `range` - min/max range

#### Changed conditions

##### `score`

`entity` parameter has now been replaced with `target`. It can either contain value from old `entity` field (like `this`) or be an score holder name in form `{"name": "..."}`.

#### Changed functions

##### `set_damage`

This function now has `add` parameter. If `true`, change will be relative to current damage. If `false`, damage will be replaced with current value (default behavior)

##### `set_count`

This function now has `add` parameter. If `true`, change will be relative to current item count. If `false`, item count will be replaced with current value (default behavior)

##### `copy_nbt`

`source` parameter can now be set to `{"storage": <namespaced id>}`, to access command storage.

#### New functions

##### `set_enchantments`

Modifies enchantments on item

###### Parameters

-   `enchantments` - map of enchantment id to level value (can be score or random number)
-   `add` - if `true`, change will be relative to current level. If `false`, level will be replaced with current value (default behavior)

#### New value providers

Note: value providers can be used in same places as random number generators.

##### `score`

Returns scaled scoreboard value.

###### Parameters

-   `score` - scoreboard name
-   `target` - same as `target` in `score` predicate
-   `scale` - scaling factor (float)

### Data Packs

Changes to data packs for version 7:

-   Removal of `/replaceitem` (replaced with `/item replace`)
-   `score` loot table condition: `entity` parameter has been replaced with `target`

## Resource Packs

Changes to resource packs for version 7:

-   Drowned texture mirroring has changed (see MC-174685)
-   slots for the game mode selector are now 26 pixels instead of 25

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w45a

Good things come to those who wait, and we've believe you've waited long enough. The first Caves & Cliffs snapshot is finally here and ready to enter the Java Edition of Minecraft! We hope that you're as excited about this as we are, because this snapshot brings you a variety of features, some changes to existing features, and a few technical changes. All of it is listed in this blog post, and we can't wait to see you experiment with it all.

Happy mining!

## New Features in 20w45a

-   Added bundles!
-   Added candles!
-   Added lava cauldrons!
-   Added Copper!
-   Added Amethyst!
-   Added Lightning Rod!
-   Added the Spyglass!
-   Added Tinted Glass!
-   A Shulker hitting a Shulker with a Shulker Bullet can make a new Shulker.

### Amethysts

#### Amethyst Blocks

-   Amethyst comes in block form inside the geodes in two ways: Block of Amethyst and Budding Amethyst
-   All types of Amethyst blocks (clusters included) create beautiful sounds when you walk on them, break them, place them, or hit them with a projectile - go make some music!

#### Amethyst Clusters

-   Amethyst Clusters grow from Budding Amethyst, which can be found inside geodes
-   Clusters have 4 growth stages: Small Amethyst Bud, Medium Amethyst Bud, Large Amethyst Bud, and Amethyst Cluster
-   Clusters can only grow when they are placed on Budding Amethyst blocks
-   Fully-grown Amethyst Clusters drop 4 Amethyst Shards (or more with Fortune) when an Iron Pickaxe or higher is used, and drop nothing otherwise when broken
-   Clusters can be Silk Touched at any stage

#### Amethyst Geodes

-   These huge geodes can be found anywhere underground in the overworld
-   Amethyst geodes have an outer layer of a new stone called Tuff
-   Amethyst geodes have a second layer of another new block called Calcite
-   Amethyst geodes have an inner layer of various Amethyst blocks

#### Amethyst Shards

-   Amethyst Clusters drop 4 Amethyst Shards (or more with Fortune)

#### Budding Amethyst

-   On any side of a Budding Amethyst block where there is air, or a water source block, a Small Amethyst Bud will eventually grow
-   Amethyst Buds can only grow when attached to Budding Amethyst, and will grow until they become Amethyst Clusters

### Bundles

-   Bundles are items that hold other items.
-   A bundle can hold a mixture of items, but only one stack’s worth. For example, a bundle could fit:
    -   64 dirt
    -   32 dirt + 32 stone
    -   32 dirt + 8 ender pearls
    -   1 of every color of wool, concrete, carpet and terracotta (64 blocks in total)
    -   Or 1 diamond helmet
-   Use right click to put an item into a bundle.
-   Right-click a bundle to empty it.
-   Wrap a present in a bundle and give it to your friend!

### Candles

-   Candles come in all 16 colors + 1 uncolored variant
-   Up to 4 can be placed in one block
-   Candles allow you to properly wish someone a happy birthday
-   Waterloggable! (But you cannot light them underwater, silly)
-   Wish anybody a happy birthday with a candle cake!

### Cauldrons

-   Cauldrons can now be filled with buckets of lava!
-   Filled lava cauldrons give off a redstone signal of strength 1

### Copper

#### Copper blocks

-   Craft 9 copper ingots to a copper block
-   Craft cut copper, cut copper stairs and cut copper slabs
-   Use honeycomb to craft waxed copper blocks

#### Copper ore

-   Copper ore can be found in ore blobs across Overworld, similar to iron and coal (this is not the final generation for copper…)
-   Smelt copper ore to get a copper ingot

#### Lightning Rod

-   The Lightning Rod is crafted from three copper ingots
-   Keep your builds safe (well, as long as the closest area around the lightning rod is fire proof) during thunderstorms!
-   The lightning rod will protect an area of 4 \* 16 blocks around it from the, sometimes devastating, lightning strikes!
-   Lightning rods give off a redstone signal when struck by lightning

#### Oxidation

-   Copper will oxidize over time
-   There are for stages: copper, lightly weathered copper, semi-weathered copper and weathered copper
-   It takes 50 - 82 Minecraft days (in loaded chunks) for a copper block to oxidize one stage
-   Waxed copper blocks will not oxidize
-   You can wax any oxidation stage - how lovely that means you can keep that pretty lightly weathered copper block in it’s lightly weathered stage forever!

### Spyglass

-   You can use your spyglass to see faraway things
-   Pretend to be a sea captain, or catch your neighbor in the act as they dye your sheep lime green
-   The spyglass is crafted from two copper ingots and one amethyst shard

### Tinted Glass

-   Tinted Glass is a type of glass that does not allow light to pass through
-   Tinted Glass is crafted by putting a Glass block in the middle of 4 Amethyst Shards
-   Tinted Glass can be obtained without silk touch; it does not shatter like normal glass

## Changes in 20w45a

-   Experience orbs now sometimes merge when in large quantities to improve performance. This does not change the rate at which the player can absorb them, it simply limits the amount of separate orbs floating around in the world. Orbs that merge will gain the lifetime of the most recently created one.
-   Simple firework rockets with 1 gunpowder can now be crafted using the recipe book
-   Dirt paths (formerly grass path) can now be made by using a shovel on dirt, podzol, mycelium or course dirt (as well as grass)
-   Minecarts and rails work in water
-   Particles now appear when pistons break blocks

### Minecarts

Minecarts and rails now work in water

-   All rails can be waterlogged (works with a dispenser & water bucket too)
-   Flowing water doesn’t break rails
-   Minecarts can pass through water, but get slowed down more than usual

## Technical Changes in 20w45a

-   Entities are now saved separately from terrain chunks.
-   Added loot table function set\_banner\_pattern
-   Pack format in version.json has been split into data and resource versions
-   Servers can now require custom resource packs to be accepted

### Custom server resource packs

A dedicated server can enforce custom resource packs by setting `require-resource-pack` in `server.properties`. When this option is used, players will be prompted for a response and will be disconnected if they decline the required pack.

### Entity storage

Entities have been extracted from main (terrain) chunks and are now stored in separate `entities` directory (similar to POI storage). Those new files are still region files with NBT.

### Loot tables

#### New functions

##### `set_banner_pattern`

Sets tags needed for banner patterns. Parameters:

-   `patterns` - list of pattern objects:
    -   `pattern` - name of pattern (`square_bottom_left`, `bricks`, etc.)
    -   `color` - name of color (`light_gray`, etc.)
-   `append` - if `true`, new elements will be appended to existing ones instead of replacing

# Minecraft 1.16.4 Pre-Release 2

Time for another pre-release! This time around we've fixed some issues with the new social interactions screen and we've also fixed some crashes.

In case you haven't heard, yesterday we announced that Mojang accounts will be migrating into Microsoft accounts. With this pre-release, we are preparing for that by having the game understand the settings and block-list of Microsoft accounts. You can read more about that over [here](https://www.minecraft.net/article/java-edition-moving-house), and you can find answers to questions you might have in the [FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/articles/360050865492). The FAQ will be continuously updated.

We aim to release 1.16.4 sometime during next week.

## Changes in 1.16.4 Pre-release 2

-   Players blocked in your Microsoft account are now also blocked in the game
-   A button to open a link to the Accessibility Guide can now be found in the Accessibility Options screen

# Minecraft 1.16.4 Pre-Release 1

The first pre-release for 1.16.4 is officially out! ​ If you’ve been on the Internet for some time, you’ve probably noticed that you occasionally run into other players that you don’t get along with. To alleviate some of that frustration, we’re introducing a UI element called the “social interactions screen”, which will let you disable chatting with certain players, thus hiding any messages you receive from them. Additionally, the 1.16.4 update will contain some fixes for critical bugs, but other than that, this will be it for this dot-release. ​ Please help us out by testing the new UI and reporting any bugs you find on the [Minecraft Issue Tracker](https://aka.ms/snapshotbugs?ref=launcher). ​

## New Features in 1.16.4 Pre-release 1

​

-   New UI called Social Interactions Screen

​

### Social Interactions Screen

​

## Technical Changes in 1.16.4 Pre-release 1

​

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w30a

Today we're releasing Snapshot 20w30a for Minecraft Java Edition in which we've tweaked Bastion Remnants, and given you the ability to have lanterns under water.

## Changes in 20w30a

-   Modified how respawn positions are chosen for beds and respawn anchors
-   Lanterns can now be waterlogged
-   Soul Lanterns can now be waterlogged
-   Tweaked the Bastion Remnant chest loot
-   Chests in Bastion Remnants are now more likely to be located on top of gilded blackstone

### Respawn Block Positions

-   Respawn anchors will prioritize cardinal directions over corners
-   Beds will prioritize the side of the bed the player entered from and then spaces circling around the foot of the bed up to the head of the bed
-   Respawning players will now face the block that they respawned at
-   Placing players onto dangerous blocks is now avoided when possible

## Technical Changes in 20w30a

-   The sign edit screen will now intialize from existing sign text (should have no noticeable impact on vanilla)
-   Tags can now have optional entries

### Optional Tag Entries

Entries in tags can now be marked as optional. Failure to resolve optional entries does not prevent the whole tag from loading.

Example:

    {
      "replace": false,
      "values": [
        "#minecraft:beds", // existing syntax
        { "id":"#missing:tag", "required": false }, // optional sub-tag entry
    "minecraft:anvil", // existing syntax
    { "id":"minecraft:stone_button", "required": true }, // new syntax for required tags
    { "id":"missing:block", "required": false } // optional single-element entry

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w28a

This week's snapshot introduces experimental support for custom biomes in data packs. This work has involved redoing some of the internal plumbing of things behind the scene, so it might be a bit leaky. We hope no important parts drip out, but if they do, pick them back up for us, please.

As always, make sure to make backups if you try a world in a snapshot.

## Changes in 20w28a

​

-   Villagers now emit green particles when joining a village, setting a home bed, or acquiring a job site/profession
-   Brewing stands can now be crafted with blackstone
-   Tweaked bartering loot
-   Totems of undying now give the fire resistance status affect for 40 seconds when activated

​

## Technical Changes in 20w28a

​

-   Custom worlds now support custom biomes
-   Dedicated servers can now rate limit clients

​

### Customized world generation

​

-   There is now experimental support for a `worldgen` folder in data packs
-   `worldgen/biome` can contain biome definitions
-   `worldgen/configured_carver` can contain definitions for world carver settings
-   `worldgen/configured_feature` can contain definitions for feature placements
-   `worldgen/configured_structure_feature` can contain definitions for structure placements
-   `worldgen/configured_surface_builder` can contain definitions for surfaces
-   `worldgen/processor_list` can contain sets of block processors
-   `worldgen/template_pool` can contain pool definitions for jigsaw structures
-   Custom biomes can now be used in the single biome/caves/floating islands world types (add the data pack containing the biome first)
-   Custom biomes can now be used in custom dimension generators

​

### Dedicated server packet limit

​

-   Dedicated servers can now kick clients that consistently send too many packets within a second
-   Controlled with the `rate-limit` settings in `server.properties`
-   The default rate limit of 0 means "no limit"

​

# Minecraft 1.16 Release Candidate

Out with the old, and in with the new! Today we're introducing a new naming convention (well, it's been a while) for Minecraft Java Edition. Previously, the last pre-release was, in fact, the release candidate, but we're now making that more clear by changing the name to be "release candidate". This means that if there are no major issues following this release, no further changes will be done before the full release.

Speaking of the full release: In case you've been living under a rock (it's Minecraft, so that's OK), [we're releasing the Nether Update on Tuesday, June 23](https://www.minecraft.net/article/the-nether-update-has-date-). That's next week!

# Minecraft 1.16 Pre-Release 1

It's time for 1.16 pre-releases!

Going forward you should mostly see bugs being fixed. Additionally, pre-releases doesn't necessarily tend to our usual cadence of releasing on Wednesdays, so keep an eye out!

## New Features in 1.16 Pre-release 1

## Changes in 1.16 Pre-release 1

-   You can now milk Cows and Mooshrooms in creative mode
-   You can now get stew from Mooshrooms in creative mode

-   When any villager is struck by lightning, the witch it is converted to will no longer despawn
-   Added gamerule universalAnger (disabled by default), which makes angered neutral mobs attack any nearby player, not just the player that angered them. Works best if you disable forgiveDeadPlayers.
-   Added gamerule forgiveDeadPlayers (enabled by default), which makes angered neutral mobs stop being angry when the targeted player dies nearby.
-   Zombified piglins no longer attack innocent bystanders (unless you enable gamerule universalAnger)
-   Zombified piglins stop being angry if the targeted player dies nearby (unless you disable gamerule forgiveDeadPlayers)

## Technical Changes in 1.16 Pre-release 1

### Pack Selection Screen

-   Packs can now be dropped directly on data and resource pack selection screens
-   Dropped files and directories will be copied to appropriate places

### Smithing Recipes

There's now a `smithing` recipe type. Recipes of this type are used in the smithing table to upgrade one item type into another type, maintaining tags.

-   `base` - Ingredient specifying an item to be upgraded.
-   `addition` - Ingredient specifying valid items to trigger the upgrade.
-   `result` - Item specifying the resulting type of the upgraded item.

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w22a

It has been a busy week for us but we still wanted to squeeze out a snapshot as we've been busy squashing a bunch of bugs.

## Experimental Rendering Changes

We've included some experimental changes to graphics rendering in this snapshot, which might reveal some issues on a small number of older graphics cards.

If do you find any new graphical bugs then please report them to the bug tracker with the make and model of your graphics card as well as which operating system you are using ​

## New Features in 20w22a

​

-   Piglins now sometimes dance in celebration of a completed hunt

​

## Changes in 20w22a

​

-   Villager workstation logic changes
-   Bells can be hung from the underside of more blocks
-   When a villager that was traded with is struck by lightning, the witch it is converted to will no longer despawn
-   Players can no longer mount another entity when the crouch key is held down

​

### Villager Workstation Logic

​

-   Villagers no longer try to work at the same workstation
-   The most experienced nearby villager for the profession corresponding to the workstation you add will get the workstation
-   Villagers now have to walk to and reach the workstation before they can acquire the profession / work there
-   Villagers can no longer claim workstations / professions during raids or night time.
-   Villagers will check and make sure their workstation is valid at all times of day as long as they are within 16 blocks of their workstation.

​

## Technical Changes in 20w22a

​

-   Slightly changed datapack loading to prevent custom datapacks from crashing
-   Cached repeated block type lookups and collisions during pathfinding for increased performance
-   Minor optimizations in collision detection
-   Top level element in predicate file can now be array (all contents will be ANDed)
-   Added shader support for accessing depth buffer.
-   Renderer now uses per-pixel blending layers for some transparent elements.

​

### Datapack loading

​

-   If datapack reload fails, changes will not be applied and game will continue using previous data
-   If existing datapacks prevent world from loading, game will give option to load world in safe mode, which loads only vanilla datapack
-   Changes to datapack list are stored only after successful reload
-   Added `--safeMode` option to server to load only with vanilla datapack
-   Game will now detect critical datapack issues, like missing required tags and prevent world from being loaded

​

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w21a

In this snapshot, we're adding support for custom world settings and custom dimensions. This is an early release to hear your feedback about this feature - do note that this support is considered experimental and unsupported. Any custom world settings may change from one snapshot to the next, and worlds using custom settings will be clearly marked as experimental in your worlds list. ​

## New Features in 20w21a

​

-   Added the ability to toggle redstone wire between a cross and a dot
-   Added import/export world settings functionality
-   Added a new disableMultiplayer command line option - when used, the Multiplayer button is disabled
-   Added a new disableChat command line option - when used, receiving and sending online chat is disabled

​

### Redstone Toggle

​

-   When right clicking a single piece of redstone, it toggles between a the cross and the dot
-   A dot of redstone will not power its surrounding blocks

​

## Changes in 20w21a

​

-   Piglins no longer walk around when admiring gold
-   If you hurt a piglin while it is admiring an ingot, the ingot will now disappear
-   Increased the chance of ores to generate in the Basalt Deltas to balance against the reduced amount of Netherrack in this biome
-   Lily pads are now considered junk fishing loot rather than treasure
-   Updated logos for Mojang Studios and Minecraft
-   Temporarily removed structure settings from flat level preset strings (workaround: use import/export settings functionality)

​

## Technical Changes in 20w21a

​

-   Added the ability to control the height of the `spreadplayers` command
-   Added custom worlds and custom dimensions

​

### Commands

​

#### `spreadplayers`

​ Added an optional argument to specify maximum height. New syntax: `spreadplayers <center> <spreadDistance> <maxRange> [under <maxHeight>] <respectTeams> <targets>` ​

-   `maxHeight` - Specifies the maximum height for resulting positions

​

#### `locate`

​

-   Structure names are now specified as lowercase

​

### Custom Worlds

​

-   Added experimental support for new custom worlds
-   Edit world screen now has an option to export world settings to a JSON file
-   During world creation you can import previously exported world settings
-   A bunch of new parameters are exposed, but marked as experimental, meaning you can play with them, but there is no guarantee that any of them will continue working (even in the next snapshot!)
-   Flat level preset string lost structure settings (they are now stored in a common format for all worlds), we will restore some form of this functionality soon
-   Buffet world can no longer be created from server.properties, flat level settings changed a bit; better support for custom world creation on the server is coming soon

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w20b

This week we are releasing a bit of a smaller snapshot. However, if you're into switching game modes and completing advancements, this is right up your alley!

-   Your last game mode is remembered and will be the first selected option, so you can quickly toggle between two game modes with a single press of F3 + F4!

​

#### F3 + N (Toggle Spectator)

A small change has been made to this debug combination. ​

-   By default, using this key would return to Creative after toggling from Spectator. It now will toggle back to the previous game mode you had.

-   Obtaining Blackstone now also counts for the `Stone Age` advancement
-   Breeding Striders now counts for `The Parrots and the Bats` and is now required for `Two by Two`

​

## Technical Changes in 20w20a

-   Shulkers with "NoAI" can now be summoned with rotation.
-   Added `thrown_item_picked_up_by_entity` advancement trigger
-   Added `player_generates_container_loot` advancement trigger
-   Added `item_used_on_block` advancement trigger
-   Removed `safely_harvest_honey` advancement trigger

​

### Advancements

#### `item_used_on_block` trigger type

Properties:

-   `item` matches the thrown item which was picked up
-   `entity` matches the entity which picked up the item

​

#### `player_generates_container_loot` trigger type

Properties:

-   `loot_table` matches the resource location of the generated loot table

​

#### `item_used_on_block` trigger type

Properties:

-   `location` matches the location at the center of the block the item was used on

​

### Miscellaneous trigger changes

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w18a

In this snapshot we made some changes to Redstone wire and we fixed a bunch of bugs.

## Changes in 20w18a

-   Redstone wire changes
-   The target block now conducts redstone signals

​

### Redstone wire

The blockstate, rendering and behavior of redstonewire are more in line with each other. Redstone will provide power to blocks on all sides it shows a visual connection to, and not do so on those sides without a visual connection. ​

-   A single redstone wire is now represented as a cross.
-   A wire on top of a block, which is redirected from below, will power the sides it is redirected to now. E.g. a fence gate above the redirecting wire will be powered.
-   Wires that redirect upwards to wires on non-conductive blocks used to only be redirected visually. Now this redirection applies to their behavior as well.
-   A wire that is redirected to go over a block will now always provide power to the block. This is most noticeable when the wire has signal strength 1.

​![Comparison between 1.15.2 and snapshot 20w18a](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/images/RedstoneChanges3_741x421.png)

## Technical Changes in 20w18a

-   Added a `enable-status` option to the server.properties file which if set to `false` will suppress replies to status requests from clients. This makes the server appear offline in the multiplayer screen.
-   Added control over how much entity data a server sends to clients
-   Advancement system changes

​

### Entity Broadcasting

It is now possible to control at what range the server sends data about entities to clients. ​

-   Added an `entity-broadcast-range-percentage` server property controlling how close entities need to be before being sent to clients. Higher values means entities are visible further away from players but cause more network traffic. Specifies percentage of default value, so for example `50` specifies half of the default range.

​

### Advancements

-   Added `player` check to every trigger (except `impossible`)
-   Entity checks in triggers can now use loot table condition syntax

​

#### Extended entity checks

Entity checks in triggers can now use loot table condition syntax. Old notation:

    {
      "trigger": "minecraft:player_killed_entity",
      "conditions": {
        "entity": {
          "type": "minecraft:blaze"
        }
      }
    }
    

is now equivalent to:

    {
      "trigger": "minecraft:player_killed_entity",
      "conditions": {
        "entity": [
          {
            "condition": "minecraft:entity_properties",
            "predicate": {
              "type": "minecraft:blaze"
            },
            "entity": "this"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    

**Note 1**: Like in loot tables, all conditions in top level array must be met for whole condition to trigger. ​ **Note 2**: To access new functionality, top level element must be JSON array. JSON object are interpreted as old notation.  
​ Full list of extended triggers:

-   New field `player` in every trigger
-   `bred_animals` - `parent`, `partner`, `child`
-   `channeled_lightning` - `victims`
-   `cured_zombie_villager` - `zombie`, `villager`
-   `fishing_rod_hooked` - `entity`
-   `killed_by_crossbow` - `victims`
-   `player_killed_entity` - `entity`
-   `entity_killed_player` - `entity`
-   `player_hurt_entity` - `entity`
-   `summoned_entity` - `entity`
-   `tame_animal` - `entity`
-   `target_hit` - `projectile`
-   `villager_trade` - `villager`

​

#### Miscellaneous trigger changes

-   Due to addition of `player`, existing contents of `location`, `slept_in_bed`, `hero_of_the_village`, `voluntary_exile` can now be placed in `location` field instead of top-level object. Old syntax is still supported, but depreciated.

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w17a

This week's snapshot brings you some tweaks, bugfixes, and technical changes!

We also have a survey up so that you can tell us what you think about the Nether Update. You can find it by clicking [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SF65G2F). We would very much appreciate if you could take the time and fill it out.

## New Features in 20w17a

-   Added an Entity Distance scale option ranging from 50% to 500%
-   Difficulty and game rules can now be changed from "Create World" screen

## Changes in 20w17a

-   Improved Smithing Table UI
-   Ruined portals now spawn less frequently
-   Renamed "Soul Fire Torch" and "Soul Fire Lantern" to "Soul Torch" and "Soul Lantern"
-   Tweaked Bastion Remnant loot
-   Walls now create posts under more things, like pressure plates and banners
-   The "Singleplayer" button will jump directly to "Create World" screen if there are no worlds to select

## Technical Changes in 20w17a

-   Block storage format in chunks slightly changed to speed up various tasks (rendering, pathfinding, world generation, etc).
-   Chat component style can now select font.
-   Full range of Unicode characters is supported (some may know what that means 😉)
-   Added the `attribute` command

### World save format

-   Saving `level.dat` now uses randomly-named temporary files (instead of using `level.dat_new` every time)
-   `player/*.dat` are now saved in a way similar to `level.dat` (including leaving `.dat_old` files)

### Block storage

`BlockStates` in `Sections` elements no longer contain values stretching over multiple 64-bit fields. If number of bits per block is not power of two (i.e. single 64-bit value can't fill whole number of blockstates) some bits will not be used. For example, if single block state takes 5 bits, highest 4 bits of every 64-bit field will be unused. That also means slight increase in storage size (in case of 5 bits, from 320 to 342 64-bit fields).

### Commands

#### `attribute`

Adds modifies attribute on single entity. Possible syntax: Parameters:

-   `attribute <target> <attribute> get [<scale>]` - get total value of attribute
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> base set <value>` - sets base valye
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> base get [<scale>]` - get base value
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> modifier add <uuid> <name> <value> add|multiply|multiply_base` - adds modifier (fails if modifier is already present)
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> modifier remove <uuid>` - removes modifier
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> modifier value get <uuid> [<scale>]` - get value of modifier
-   `target` - single entity (note: only players, armor stands and mobs have attributes)
-   `attribute` - name of attribute (like `minecraft:generic.max_health`)
-   `name` - string (in optional quotes) describing human-readable name of modifier
-   `value` - floating point value (note: certain attributes have limits on final value, so your change might not be noticeable)

### Chat components

#### Hover event argument

-   `style.hoverEvent` parameter now has parameter `contents`, with contents depending on type:
    -   For `show_text` - chat component
    -   For `show_item` - either item id or object with fields `id`, `count` and `tag` (with last one being serialized NBT)
    -   For `show_entity` - object with fields: `id` (UUID), `name` (chat component) and `type` (entity type resource location)
-   Old style `value` argument is now deprecated (but still supported)

#### Colors

`color` property can now contain RGB value prefixed by `#`. For example `#55ff55` will result in the same color as `green`.

#### Custom fonts

Chat component style now supports `font` property, which is resource location for font in resource pack. No entry is equivalent to `minecraft:default`.

### Fonts

-   `Force Unicode` option now switches between normal and alternative font (called `uniform.json`) - no reload needed

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w16a

Bastion remnants, or "home sweet home" as Piglins would call them, are finally here! This snapshot introduces the home of the Piglins. If you scour the world you might also find ruins of some old portals.

## New Features in 20w16a

-   Added Bastion Remnants!
-   Added Ruined Portals
-   Added chain blocks
-   Added a new music disc titled "Pigstep" by Lena Raine which can only be found in Bastions Remnants

### Bastion Remnants

What's made of Blackstone and full of piglins and hoglins? Bastion Remnants!

-   Added 4 separate Bastion Remnant types: Bridge, Hoglin Stable, Housing Units, and Treasure Room
-   You can find these sizable structures in all biomes in the Nether except the treacherous ash-dusted towers of Basalt Deltas
-   Explore, loot, and conquer a Bastion Remnant to call it your home...but beware, Piglins don't take kindly to intruders stealing their things

### Ruined Portals

Shattered remains of ancient nether portals. Wonder who built them?

-   They can be found in any overworld or nether biome
-   Some are hidden underground, under the sea, or buried in sand

## Changes in 20w16a

-   The piglin banner pattern can now be found in Bastion Remnants
-   Increased the amount of lava pools to make the deltas more "deltary"

## Technical Changes in 20w16a

-   Added a button in the GUI that generates a jigsaw structure starting from the jigsaw block, using given generation depth.
-   Expanded the max size per axis of Structure Blocks from 32 to 48
-   Added a JMX MBean to monitor dedicated server tick times

### JMX Monitoring

It is now possible to monitor the server tick times though JMX. The rationale for this is that JMX is a well known and supported monitoring technology with existing integrations and tools.

This enables server admins to hook alerts and graphing tools using ordinary JMX clients and dashboards.

#### Enabling JMX Monitoring

-   A new flag `enable-jmx-monitoring` has been added to the server.properties file which if set to `true` will expose an MBean with the Object name `net.minecraft.server:type=Server` and two attributes `averageTickTime` and `tickTimes` exposing the tick times in milliseconds.
-   In order for enabling JMX on the Java runtime you also need to add a couple of JVM flags to the startup as documented [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html).

## Fixed bugs in 20w16a

-   [MC-37557](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-37557) Sometimes a minecart sound plays/subtitle shown when loading a world
-   [MC-91163](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-91163) Certain subtitles show up when the player is too far away to hear the sound

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w15a

It's a wonderful day here in Sweden today! The sun is shining and spring is in the air, and when I say "spring" I mean **pollen**. Let's remedy that by 1) Staying indoors and 2) Introduce an all new biome with a grain of basalt, blackstone, and magma cubes! To spice it up, we also have some new fine tunes for you to listen to while traversing the Nether. Enjoy the snapshot!

## New Features in 20w15a

-   Accessibility improvements
-   Added a piglin banner pattern
-   Added Basalt Deltas biome to the Nether
-   Added soul campfires. Warm your buns with the heat of one thousand souls!
-   Added three new tracks of Nether music
-   Added chiseled nether bricks, cracked nether bricks, and quartz bricks!
-   Added a new set of stone blocks called Blackstone with regular, polished, and polished brick variants!
-   Added Gilded Blackstone - Blackstone which has been imbued with gold and has a chance of dropping gold nuggets when broken
-   Blackstone can be used to craft furnaces and stone tools

### Accessibility

-   Added "Line Spacing" chat and accessibility option
-   Added "Chat Delay" accessibility option

### Basalt Deltas

Basalt Deltas can now be found in the Nether!

-   Remnants of volcanic eruptions, this biome sports a high concentration of Basalt columns and lava deltas
-   Walking through, you will be surrounded by flakes of flowing white ash
-   Magma Cubes finally have a place to call home, spawning very frequently
-   A new block, Blackstone, can be found in large patches here

### Nether Music

We're happy to announce that we've added three new tracks for the upcoming Nether Update, all composed by the very talented Lena Raine.

-   Rubedo will be played in the Nether Wastes
-   So Below will be played in Soul Sand Valleys and in Basalt Deltas
-   Chrysopoeia will be played in Crimson Forests

Some words from Lena:

-   "One of the primary instruments in Minecraft is the piano, and so one of my challenges to myself was to see how far I could push the sound of the piano until it resembled other things entirely–again, that alchemical process."
-   "I wanted each piece to feel like a progression of emotions, or a journey from place to place within this other world. There's a degree of beauty to the Nether, but it is also terrifying in both its details and scale."

Take a portal to the Nether, and stay awhile and listen...

## Changes in 20w15a

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w14a

Even though we just added [every update imaginable to Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/article/every-update-imaginable-coming-minecraft), we thought that it might be good to pick up the Nether Update snapshots from where we left off. This snapshot introduces the Zoglins!

## New Features in 20w14a

-   Hoglins that somehow end up in the Overworld become Zoglins fairly quickly - but who would ever bring a Hoglin to the Overworld?
-   Compasses can now be enchanted with Curse of Vanishing

​

### Zoglins

​

-   Zoglins are zombified hoglins - the result of bringing a hoglin into the overworld
-   Unlike hoglins they can't be bred or fed, and they don't care about warped fungus
-   Beware - these beasts are raving mad and attack just about everything they see!

## Changes in 20w14a

-   The main menu background is now in the Nether
-   The General statistics list is now alphabetically sorted
-   Strider balancing

### Strider Balancing

-   Strider speed while mounted has been significantly increased to more closely resemble boat speeds
-   Warped Fungus on a Stick now has 100 max item damage, and only takes 1 damage per Strider consume
-   When Warped Fungus on a Stick is used with Striders, the boost is a great way to traverse the lava seas

​

## Technical Changes in 20w14a

-   The compass now has `LodestonePos`, `LodestoneDimension` and `LodestoneTracked` data fields. If `LodestoneTracked` is zero, the game will skip checking for a Lodestone in the specified position.
-   Attributes are now added to game registry, similar to items, sound events, etc.
-   Region files are now opened in synchronous mode to increase reliability

​

### Attributes

Attributes have been moved to game registry. That means few changes: ​

-   Items and entities will no longer keep unknown attributes
-   Names of some attributes have been renamed to meet resource location requirements

#### Renames:

-   `generic.maxHealth` 🡆 `generic.max_health`
-   `zombie.spawnReinforcements` 🡆 `zombie.spawn_reinforcements`
-   `horse.jumpStrength` 🡆 `horse.jump_strength`
-   `generic.followRange` 🡆 `generic.follow_range`
-   `generic.knockbackResistance` 🡆 `generic.knockback_resistance`
-   `generic.movementSpeed` 🡆 `generic.movement_speed`
-   `generic.flyingSpeed` 🡆 `generic.flying_speed`
-   `generic.attackDamage` 🡆 `generic.attack_damage`
-   `generic.attackKnockback` 🡆 `generic.attack_knockback`
-   `generic.attackSpeed` 🡆 `generic.attack_speed`
-   `generic.armorToughness` 🡆 `generic.armor_toughness`

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w11a

In this snapshot you can be on your merry way across the beautiful Soulsand Valleys with your freshly enchanted boots. It's a bit scary to be fair, so these boots will help you out with that bit...

## Before we dive into this snapshot, a word about Redstone

Redstone is one of the coolest things in Minecraft and many of you are members of communities that focus on building mind-blowing redstone contraptions, farms, computing machines and 256x256 piston doors.

A lot of redstone behaviour is currently categorized as “undefined”. This is when the behaviour of the block is not the result of intentional code but is a side-effect of unaccounted edge cases or quirks in the game code.​

We know that many players consider undefined behaviour as a very interesting aspect of redstone and enjoy experimenting with and using undefined behaviour to build unique contraptions to share with the rest of the community.​

However, the quirks of undefined behaviour can be quite surprising - even when building simple contraptions. This quirkiness can be a negative experience for players new to redstone and may turn them away from this very unique and exciting aspect of Minecraft as well as the vast redstone community behind it.​

Our goal is to bring all redstone components up to a level of quality that we are happy with and we will be making adjustments where it makes the most sense for redstone going forward.

Any changes we make will be communicated in the snapshot changelogs and as always we will be reading your feedback and comments.

## New Features in 20w11a

-   Added Soul Speed enchantment
-   Added Twisting Vines that grow upwards
-   Nether gold ore can now be found in the nether - it is just like gold ore, but more Nether-y

### Soul Speed

Never suffer again drudging through Soul Sand Valleys - Soul Speed has you covered!

-   Shine your boots of choice with this soul-sucking enchantment to speed around on Soul Sand and Soul Soil!
-   There's a downside, however: enchantments will slowly degrade your boots each Soul block you walk on
-   Can only be obtained by bartering with those pesky Piglins

## Changes in 20w11a

-   Bell blocks will now ring when hit by any projectile
-   TNT and Campfires will now ignite when hit by any burning projectile
-   Bone meal can now be used to grow kelp, weeping vines and twisting vines
-   Hoes are now the appropriate tools for mining Hay, Targets, Dried Kelp Blocks, Shroomlights, Nether Wart Blocks and Warped Wart Blocks
-   Doors, rails, buttons, pressure plates, redstone and more can now be placed on soulsand and full-block of snow layers
-   Soul sand with a rail on top will no longer slow-down minecarts

## Technical Changes in 20w11a

-   `minecraft:soul_speed_blocks` is any block that the Soul Speed enchantment increases speed on
-   New particle type: `soul`

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w09a

Today is a sad day for Obsidian... It's crying. If you're not into crying you could always take aim at the new Target that we've added.

This update can also be found on [minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-20w09a).

If you find any bugs, please report them on the official [Minecraft Issue Tracker](https://aka.ms/snapshotbugs?ref=reddit).

## New Features in 20w09a

-   Added the Target Block!
-   Added new Crying Obsidian block! It's sad and it cries purple energy

### Target Block

Because let’s face it, your aim could use some practice

-   The closer you hit to the center, the larger the redstone signal!
-   Test your skills with a variety of projectiles, including eggs, snowballs, tridents, and more!
-   You will need one hay block and four redstone for this recipe

### Zombified Piglin

-   Zombie Pigmen are now known as Zombified Piglins, and they now have ears... or well, one at least

## Changes in 20w09a

-   Bartering loot has been restructured to be more appealing to Survival players
-   Crying Obsidian can now be obtained from Piglin Bartering
-   Entities now get pushed by flowing lava
-   Huge Fungi will now grow only on its matching type of Nylium
-   Can now place Warped/Crimson roots and fungi into pots
-   Nether wart blocks and warped wart block can be cleared quickly using a hoe
-   Weeping vines are now climbable!
-   Biome fog color smoothly blends between biomes. Smooth
-   Changed ambient block lighting in the Nether to be on parity with other editions

### Block Renames

Some blocks have been renamed. Turns out singular Fungus in the Nether attempted to falsely present itself as many Fungi - very sneaky!

-   Crimson Fungi is now called Crimson Fungus
-   Warped Fungi is now called Warped Fungus

## Technical Changes in 20w09a

-   New particle types: `dripping_obsidian_tear`, `falling_obsidian_tear`, `landing_obsidian_tear`
-   Piglins now have an `IsImmuneToZombification` data value that prevents them from zombifying in the overworld

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w08a

A wild snapshot appears! To tell you the truth, we hadn't actually planned to do a snapshot this week, but the Villagers were in dire need of neurosurgery.

## Fixed bug in 20w08a

-   [MC-172078](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-172078) All villagers with saved memory disappear when upgrading to 20w07a

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w07a

Ahh, a freshly baked snapshot! It undoubtedly smells better than the piglins that we just added...

## Features in 20w07a

-   Endermen can now pick up some of the new Nether blocks
-   Endermen will no longer pick up Netherrack
-   Gave Hoglins some actual functionality
-   Added Piglins
-   Netherite blocks can be used as the base of a beacon and Netherite ingots can be used as the fuel for a beacon. Weird flex but ok.

### Advancements

-   Piglins and hoglins are now required for Monster Hunter and Monsters Hunted

### Hoglins

-   Hoglins are big aggressive beasts that live in crimson forests in the nether
-   They attack players on sight, so be careful, they can easily knock you off a ledge!
-   Hoglins drop pork and sometimes leather, but not willingly
-   You can breed hoglins by feeding them crimson fungi, but do so at your own risk
-   Hoglins get hunted by piglins sometimes, but they don't go down without a fight!
-   Despite this, hoglins and piglin aren't enemies - they are more like an ecosystem
-   Baby hoglins like to pretend they are tough - but don't worry, they are more like angry puppies with no teeth
-   Want to keep hoglins off your back? Pro tip: Hoglins hate the smell of warped fungi!

### Piglins

-   Piglins are an aggressive civilization that live in the nether
-   They mostly hang around in the crimson forest, but you might find some in the nether wastes too
-   They think of players as target practice and will attack on sight
-   However if you dress appropriately they will see you as a respectable figure, or tolerable at least
-   Piglins are suspicious of strangers and if they see you opening a chest, or mining a block of gold, they will assume that you're stealing and will treat you accordingly
-   Piglins LOVE gold and get very distracted by gold items
-   Gold ingots are currency to piglins and you can throw ingots at them or right-click them with an ingot to barter for various goods
-   Piglins sometimes get hungry and hunt hoglins for food. Or they try at least. They results... vary.
-   Piglins prefer to hunt and fight in groups, and when a fight is happening everyone wants in
-   Piglins that somehow end up in the overworld become zombified fairly quickly
-   Piglins are creeped out by soul fire and zombified piglins, and will stay clear whenever possible
-   Wither skeletons are a historic enemy and piglins will attack on sight
-   Baby piglins are not as dangerous, but they can be mischievous so watch your back
-   ... and they like to play with baby hoglins

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w06a

## Features in 20w06a

-   Added new Nether blocks!
-   Knockback resistance is now a scale instead of a probability
-   Added Crimson Forest biome to the Nether
-   Added Hoglins - they don't do much yet, but they have cute flappy ears!
-   Patrols no longer spawn when the player is close to any village
-   Added Netherite!
-   Added Soulsand Valley biome to the Nether
-   Walls do not have gaps anymore when stacked vertically
-   Added Warped Forest biome to the Nether

### Blocks

Many new block types have been added!

-   Two new wood-like materials - Crimson Stems and Warped Stems
-   Basalt blocks - you can find them as pillars but they can be placed in any direction
-   New ground surface blocks: Crimson Nylium and Warped Nylium
-   New vegetation: Nether Sprouts, Crimson Roots and Warped Roots
-   Two types of Fungi: Crimson and Warped - try using bone meal to grow them!
-   Warped Wart blocks
-   Weeping Vines that grow from the bottom of a block downwards!
-   A new natural light source: Shroomlights
-   Added Soul Soil! Whenever fire burns on Soul Soil, it burns with a blue flame!
-   Soul Soil can be used to craft Soul Torches - and those can be crafted into Soul Lanterns!
-   Using bone meal on Netherrack can now spread Nylium

### Crimson Forest

Crimson Forests can now be found in the Nether!

-   Crimson nylium carpets the cave floor with all kinds of strange new vegetation
-   Huge Crimson Fungi make up the "trees" of this forest, with Shroomlights lighting up the forest floor
-   Weeping Vines grow from the cave ceilings and fungi
-   Hoglins wander these Forests
-   Crimson spores swirl through the air

### Netherite

-   A new high level material found in the Nether. Use it to upgrade your diamond gear!

#### How to make Netherite

-   Mine Ancient Debris in the lower depths of the Nether. At own risk. No insurance coverage for that.
-   Refine it into Netherite Scrap in a furnace (although that's kind of slow so you might want a Blast Furnace).
-   Combine 4 Nether Scrap with 4 Gold Ingots in a crafting table to make a Netherite Ingot.

#### Netherite effects

-   Netherite items float in lava. So you don't lose all your gear after that unplanned lava bath.
-   Netherite items have higher enchantment value than diamond (but not as high as gold).
-   Netherite tools work faster and last longer than diamond.
-   Netherite weapons do more damage than diamond.
-   Netherite armor have higher toughness and durability than diamond.
-   Netherite armor gives you knockback resistance, so you barely get knocked back at all when hit by arrows and such.
-   And it looks cool!

### Soulsand Valley

Soulsand Valleys can now be found in the Nether!

-   An open space made mostly of Soul Sand and Soul Soil
-   Basalt pillars span from floor to ceiling
-   Fossile remains of unknown creatures from the past litter the valley
-   Ash falls through the air
-   A light blue glow envelopes the valley
-   Beware of Skeletons here

### Sounds

-   Ghasts sounds are now heard at shorter range
-   Updated block sounds for Bone Blocks, Netherrack, Soul Sand, Netherwart, Nether Bricks and Quartz Ore

### Warped Forest

Warped Forests can now be found in the Nether!

-   Warped nylium carpets the cave floor with all kinds of strange new vegetation
-   Huge Warped Fungi make up the "trees" of this forest, with Shroomlights lighting up the forest floor
-   A dark blue fog covers the forest!
-   Warped spores swirl through the air
-   The Warped Forests are strange, but also the least hostile place of Nether

### World Generation

-   The old Nether biome is now called Nether Wastes
-   Made shipwrecks and ocean ruins a bit less common, so you get more excited when you find one!

## Technical changes in 20w06a

-   Added a `locatebiome` command

### Commands

#### locatebiome

New command that locates a specified biome. Useful in creative mode when you're looking for a specific biome and don't want to fly around randomly searching for it. Syntax: `locatebiome <biome>` Parameters:

-   `biome` - The id of the biome to find

### Particles
