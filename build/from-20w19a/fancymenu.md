In this snapshot we made some changes to Redstone wire and we fixed a bunch of bugs.

## Changes in 20w18a

-   Redstone wire changes
-   The target block now conducts redstone signals

​

### Redstone wire

The blockstate, rendering and behavior of redstonewire are more in line with each other. Redstone will provide power to blocks on all sides it shows a visual connection to, and not do so on those sides without a visual connection. ​

-   A single redstone wire is now represented as a cross.
-   A wire on top of a block, which is redirected from below, will power the sides it is redirected to now. E.g. a fence gate above the redirecting wire will be powered.
-   Wires that redirect upwards to wires on non-conductive blocks used to only be redirected visually. Now this redirection applies to their behavior as well.
-   A wire that is redirected to go over a block will now always provide power to the block. This is most noticeable when the wire has signal strength 1.

​![Comparison between 1.15.2 and snapshot 20w18a](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/images/RedstoneChanges3_741x421.png)

## Technical Changes in 20w18a

-   Added a `enable-status` option to the server.properties file which if set to `false` will suppress replies to status requests from clients. This makes the server appear offline in the multiplayer screen.
-   Added control over how much entity data a server sends to clients
-   Advancement system changes

​

### Entity Broadcasting

It is now possible to control at what range the server sends data about entities to clients. ​

-   Added an `entity-broadcast-range-percentage` server property controlling how close entities need to be before being sent to clients. Higher values means entities are visible further away from players but cause more network traffic. Specifies percentage of default value, so for example `50` specifies half of the default range.

​

### Advancements

-   Added `player` check to every trigger (except `impossible`)
-   Entity checks in triggers can now use loot table condition syntax

​

#### Extended entity checks

Entity checks in triggers can now use loot table condition syntax. Old notation:

    {
      "trigger": "minecraft:player_killed_entity",
      "conditions": {
        "entity": {
          "type": "minecraft:blaze"
        }
      }
    }
    

is now equivalent to:

    {
      "trigger": "minecraft:player_killed_entity",
      "conditions": {
        "entity": [
          {
            "condition": "minecraft:entity_properties",
            "predicate": {
              "type": "minecraft:blaze"
            },
            "entity": "this"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    

**Note 1**: Like in loot tables, all conditions in top level array must be met for whole condition to trigger. ​ **Note 2**: To access new functionality, top level element must be JSON array. JSON object are interpreted as old notation.  
​ Full list of extended triggers:

-   New field `player` in every trigger
-   `bred_animals` - `parent`, `partner`, `child`
-   `channeled_lightning` - `victims`
-   `cured_zombie_villager` - `zombie`, `villager`
-   `fishing_rod_hooked` - `entity`
-   `killed_by_crossbow` - `victims`
-   `player_killed_entity` - `entity`
-   `entity_killed_player` - `entity`
-   `player_hurt_entity` - `entity`
-   `summoned_entity` - `entity`
-   `tame_animal` - `entity`
-   `target_hit` - `projectile`
-   `villager_trade` - `villager`

​

#### Miscellaneous trigger changes

-   Due to addition of `player`, existing contents of `location`, `slept_in_bed`, `hero_of_the_village`, `voluntary_exile` can now be placed in `location` field instead of top-level object. Old syntax is still supported, but depreciated.

This week's snapshot brings you some tweaks, bugfixes, and technical changes!

We also have a survey up so that you can tell us what you think about the Nether Update. You can find it by clicking [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SF65G2F). We would very much appreciate if you could take the time and fill it out.

## New Features in 20w17a

-   Added an Entity Distance scale option ranging from 50% to 500%
-   Difficulty and game rules can now be changed from "Create World" screen

## Changes in 20w17a

-   Improved Smithing Table UI
-   Ruined portals now spawn less frequently
-   Renamed "Soul Fire Torch" and "Soul Fire Lantern" to "Soul Torch" and "Soul Lantern"
-   Tweaked Bastion Remnant loot
-   Walls now create posts under more things, like pressure plates and banners
-   The "Singleplayer" button will jump directly to "Create World" screen if there are no worlds to select

## Technical Changes in 20w17a

-   Block storage format in chunks slightly changed to speed up various tasks (rendering, pathfinding, world generation, etc).
-   Chat component style can now select font.
-   Full range of Unicode characters is supported (some may know what that means 😉)
-   Added the `attribute` command

### World save format

-   Saving `level.dat` now uses randomly-named temporary files (instead of using `level.dat_new` every time)
-   `player/*.dat` are now saved in a way similar to `level.dat` (including leaving `.dat_old` files)

### Block storage

`BlockStates` in `Sections` elements no longer contain values stretching over multiple 64-bit fields. If number of bits per block is not power of two (i.e. single 64-bit value can't fill whole number of blockstates) some bits will not be used. For example, if single block state takes 5 bits, highest 4 bits of every 64-bit field will be unused. That also means slight increase in storage size (in case of 5 bits, from 320 to 342 64-bit fields).

### Commands

#### `attribute`

Adds modifies attribute on single entity. Possible syntax: Parameters:

-   `attribute <target> <attribute> get [<scale>]` - get total value of attribute
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> base set <value>` - sets base valye
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> base get [<scale>]` - get base value
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> modifier add <uuid> <name> <value> add|multiply|multiply_base` - adds modifier (fails if modifier is already present)
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> modifier remove <uuid>` - removes modifier
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> modifier value get <uuid> [<scale>]` - get value of modifier
-   `target` - single entity (note: only players, armor stands and mobs have attributes)
-   `attribute` - name of attribute (like `minecraft:generic.max_health`)
-   `name` - string (in optional quotes) describing human-readable name of modifier
-   `value` - floating point value (note: certain attributes have limits on final value, so your change might not be noticeable)

### Chat components

#### Hover event argument

-   `style.hoverEvent` parameter now has parameter `contents`, with contents depending on type:
    -   For `show_text` - chat component
    -   For `show_item` - either item id or object with fields `id`, `count` and `tag` (with last one being serialized NBT)
    -   For `show_entity` - object with fields: `id` (UUID), `name` (chat component) and `type` (entity type resource location)
-   Old style `value` argument is now deprecated (but still supported)

#### Colors

`color` property can now contain RGB value prefixed by `#`. For example `#55ff55` will result in the same color as `green`.

#### Custom fonts

Chat component style now supports `font` property, which is resource location for font in resource pack. No entry is equivalent to `minecraft:default`.

### Fonts

-   `Force Unicode` option now switches between normal and alternative font (called `uniform.json`) - no reload needed

Bastion remnants, or "home sweet home" as Piglins would call them, are finally here! This snapshot introduces the home of the Piglins. If you scour the world you might also find ruins of some old portals.

## New Features in 20w16a

-   Added Bastion Remnants!
-   Added Ruined Portals
-   Added chain blocks
-   Added a new music disc titled "Pigstep" by Lena Raine which can only be found in Bastions Remnants

### Bastion Remnants

What's made of Blackstone and full of piglins and hoglins? Bastion Remnants!

-   Added 4 separate Bastion Remnant types: Bridge, Hoglin Stable, Housing Units, and Treasure Room
-   You can find these sizable structures in all biomes in the Nether except the treacherous ash-dusted towers of Basalt Deltas
-   Explore, loot, and conquer a Bastion Remnant to call it your home...but beware, Piglins don't take kindly to intruders stealing their things

### Ruined Portals

Shattered remains of ancient nether portals. Wonder who built them?

-   They can be found in any overworld or nether biome
-   Some are hidden underground, under the sea, or buried in sand

## Changes in 20w16a

-   The piglin banner pattern can now be found in Bastion Remnants
-   Increased the amount of lava pools to make the deltas more "deltary"

## Technical Changes in 20w16a

-   Added a button in the GUI that generates a jigsaw structure starting from the jigsaw block, using given generation depth.
-   Expanded the max size per axis of Structure Blocks from 32 to 48
-   Added a JMX MBean to monitor dedicated server tick times

### JMX Monitoring

It is now possible to monitor the server tick times though JMX. The rationale for this is that JMX is a well known and supported monitoring technology with existing integrations and tools.

This enables server admins to hook alerts and graphing tools using ordinary JMX clients and dashboards.

#### Enabling JMX Monitoring

-   A new flag `enable-jmx-monitoring` has been added to the server.properties file which if set to `true` will expose an MBean with the Object name `net.minecraft.server:type=Server` and two attributes `averageTickTime` and `tickTimes` exposing the tick times in milliseconds.
-   In order for enabling JMX on the Java runtime you also need to add a couple of JVM flags to the startup as documented [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html).
