# Minecraft 1.20 Pre-Release 6

The sixth pre-release of the 1.20 update is here, yet again containing more bug fixes.

Happy mining!

## Technical Changes

-   `"item": "minecraft:air"` can no longer be used in datapack recipes
-   Ingredients in array form are now also allowed in `smithing_trim` and `smithing_transform` recipes on fields `template`, `base` and `addition`
    -   Those fields also allow empty arrays, which signalize that slot needs to be left empty

### Loot tables

#### Random sequences

The ID of the random sequence is now an optional field. If no sequence name is given, loot is drawn using a non-deterministic random source.

It is now time for the first Pre-release for Minecraft 1.20: The Trails and Tales update!

From now on, you should mostly see bugs being fixed. In addition to that, pre-releases don't follow the regular snapshot cadence of releasing on Wednesdays, so keep an eye out for the next pre-release.

As always, a big thank you to the community for your feedback, bugs reported, and awesome ideas throughout the snapshot series. Let the pre-releases commence!

## Changes

-   Colored Wool, Carpets and Beds can now be dyed to any other color

## Technical Changes

-   Added new damage types: `outside_border` and `generic_kill`
-   Random sequences for loot tables are now deterministic
-   Changes in `server.properties` encoding
-   `string` data sources for the `data` command now accept negative boundaries, which are interpreted as index counted from the end of the string

### Damage Types

-   Players outside the world border are now hurt by the damage type `outside_border` instead of `in_wall`
-   Forcibly removing an entity using i.e. the `/kill` command now uses damage type `generic_kill` instead of `out_of_world`

### Loot Table Random Sequences

The game now uses named random sequences to deterministically produce loot for loot tables. Each random sequence produces a unique sequence based on the world seed and sequence ID, which means a loot table will produce the same results when ran with the same parameters in the same world.

The ID of the random sequence to use for a loot table is specified in a new field called `random_sequence`.

### `server.properties`

-   File is now read in UTF-8 initially, with previous encoding (ISO 8859-1/Latin 1) as a fallback
-   File is now written with UTF-8 encoding

A third Release Candidate is now available for Minecraft 1.19.4, fixing one issue in preparation for the full release of Minecraft 1.19.4 tomorrow.

Happy Crafting!

## Fixed bug in 1.19.4 Release Candidate 3

-   [MC-260901](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-260901) Guardians deal thorns damage even while their spikes are retracted

---

We are releasing a second Release Candidate for 1.19.4 to fix a few critical issues.

## Fixed bugs in 1.19.4 Release Candidate 2

-   [MC-260677](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-260677) Advancement icons handle translucent textures wrong

---

Here is the first (and hopefully last) release candidate for 1.19.4. Unless something critical pops up, no further changes will be made for the full release, which is planned for next week.

Happy mining!

## Technical Changes

Changes to display entity interpolation:

-   interpolation always starts at the beginning on client tick
-   field `interpolation_start` is replaced with `start_interpolation`, with a different meaning
-   `start_interpolation` describes amount of ticks from the start of next client tick after receiving an update to start of interpolation
    -   for example value `0` means that interpolation will start at the beginning of next client tick after receiving the update
-   `start_interpolation` is not stored in entity data
    -   when using data commands, if interpolated value is updated, but `start_interpolation` is not present in modified tag, interpolation will continue from the time of previous update, but with new values

## Fixed bugs in 1.19.4-rc1

-   [MC-260857](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-260857) Display entities summoned with initial transformation interpolate incorrectly from default transformation during next transformation

---

Happy mining!

## Changes
