# Minecraft 1.20.3 Pre-Release 1

We're bringing you the first Pre-Release of 1.20.3 with updates to server resource pack handling and bug fixes!

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 26
-   The Resource Pack version is now 22
-   Changes to downloaded/world resource pack handling

### World resource packs

Changes apply to world resource packs (`resources.zip`), Realms resource packs and resource packs controlled by dedicated servers.

#### UI

-   Download screen has been replaced with a toast
-   World resource pack application will start together with chunk loading

#### Local storage

Downloaded packs are now stored in `downloads` directory (with different file organization than old `server-resource-packs`)

-   Files in this directory are no longer automatically cleaned (previously only up 10 packs were kept)
-   Additionally, inside this directory there is also log file `log.json` that stores information about downloaded files for debug purposes

#### Server config

Downloaded packs now have unique id (GUID/UUID) that can be used to differentiate them

-   This value for dedicated server pack can be configured with `resource-pack-id` option in `server.properties`
-   If the value is missing, it will be generated based on URL
-   If hash of a pack is not set, this pack will be redownloaded before every application
    -   Previously, if hash was missing, latest downloaded version of pack was applied

#### Packets

Some additional options are added for 3rd-party servers software:

-   Client can now accept multiple server resource packs
-   New packet was added to un-apply server resource packs
-   Resource packs are no longer cleaned when entering configuration phase

## Data Pack Version 26

-   Renamed `minecraft:grass` block and item to `minecraft:short_grass`

## Resource Pack Version 22

-   Renamed `minecraft:grass` block and item to `minecraft:short_grass`

# Minecraft 1.20.2 Pre-Release 1

Are you pre-pared for Pre-release 1 of 1.20.2? Moving into pre-releases means that, moving forward, you won't see any significant changes besides bug fixes and tweaks until the next snapshot cycle. It also means that we will be releasing more frequently than just Wednesdays, so keep your eyes peeled! However, Pre-release 1 brings new changes to the 'Villager Trade Rebalance' experiment, updates to Recipe Book search, command changes, and a new game rule!

Happy crafting!

## Changes

-   The Recipe Book search has been updated with the following changes:
    -   The search will only match the beginning of any word in the item's name
        -   For example, searching for "tor" will still show Torch and Redstone Torch but not Daylight Detector anymore
    -   All recipes, including those that have not been unlocked, will now show up in search results
    -   This will enable experienced players to find the recipes they are looking for (even if it hasn't been unlocked yet) without overwhelming new players
-   Updated structure icons on explorer maps sold by Cartographers
-   When villagers unlock new trades, the order of those trades in the UI is now always random instead of sometimes being deterministic

## Technical Changes

-   The data pack version is now 18
-   Client options are now sent during the configuration network phase when joining a server

### Data Pack Version 18

This data pack version removes the recently introduced `execute if function` and `return run` functionality. Flaws with those commands (see bugs [MC-264595](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-264595), [MC-264699](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-264699) and [MC-264710](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-264710)) require some substantial changes to fix, which we do not want to make close to a release.

These commands will instead be reintroduced early in the next snapshot series when we can take the time to iterate on and test them together with pack makers.

-   Removed `execute if|unless function` command form
-   Removed `return run` command form
-   Numbers used as macro arguments are now always inserted without suffixes, regardless of numeric type
-   Added game rule `enderPearlsVanishOnDeath`, controlling whether thrown ender pearls vanish when the player that threw them dies (default `true`)

## Experimental Features

### Villager Trade Rebalance Part 2

This pre-release updates the Villager Trade Rebalance experiment. This experiment has no effect on normal worlds. If you want to try these changes, you must turn on the Feature Toggle in the Experiments Menu when creating a new world. You can find more information about Feature Toggles [here](https://www.minecraft.net/article/testing-new-minecraft-features/feature-toggles-java-edition).

Thank you to everyone that has sent in their suggestions and feedback regarding the experimental trade change! We are trying out these changes to rebalance the villager trade system and make it more fair and fun for everyone. However, these changes are not yet final, and they will stay as experimental features while we continue to work on them. We appreciate your feedback on these changes. Visit [this link](https://aka.ms/VillagerTradingFeedback) to share your thoughts! We have been following the discussions about the previous Librarian and Wandering Trader updates and look forward to seeing the conversation continue.

#### Cartographer

Before now, Cartographers only sold maps to the Ocean Monument and Woodland Mansion. In this experiment Cartographers can sell seven new maps as well. These new maps each point to a different village or structure and can be used to find seven different biomes. This will help players who want to quickly find a specific location without waiting until they come across it by chance.

Cartographers from different biomes will sell a different selection of maps. Starting from one village, it will be possible to find every other village type by following maps from village to village.

Cartographers now sell 7 new maps: Desert Village Map, Jungle Explorer Map, Plains Village Map, Savanna Village Map, Snow Village Map, Swamp Explorer Map, and Taiga Village Map.

#### Armorer

The Armorer's trades have been updated with many changes.

The biggest change is that buying diamond armor now requires paying a small amount of Diamonds as well as Emeralds. This is meant to make the Armorer's diamond armor trades less useful at the start of the game when players don't have any Diamonds, while still giving a powerful advantage to advanced players who have spent some time collecting Diamonds.

Early-game players will find Armorers useful as a great source of iron armor, Shields and Emeralds.

Other changes include:

-   Most master-level Armorers buy Iron Blocks (and pay very well for them)
-   Chainmail armor is exclusively sold by the secret Jungle and Swamp Armorers
-   The Savanna Armorer sells cursed diamond armor at reduced prices
-   The Taiga Armorer can swap one piece of diamond armor for another

#### Structure Loot

Certain Enchanted Books now have a high chance of generating in some structures:

-   Ancient Cities: Mending
-   Mineshafts: Efficiency (I to V)
-   Pillager Outposts: Quick Charge (I to III)
-   Desert Temples: Unbreaking (I to III)
-   Jungle Temples: Unbreaking (I to III)

We are now releasing the first, and hopefully only, release-candidate for 1.20, containing two bug fixes. If all goes well, no further changes will be made before the full release of Minecraft 1.20 on Wednesday next week.

Happy crafting!

## Fixed bugs in 1.20 Release Candidate 1

-   [MC-256477](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-256477) Knowledge books can't be placed in chiseled bookshelves
-   [MC-262853](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-262853) Pitcher plant breaks and floats when growing without enough light

# Minecraft 1.20 Pre-release 7

Pre-release 7 for Minecraft 1.20 is now available in the Minecraft Launcher. This pre-release adds validation of symbolic links and fixes a bug.

### Changes

To improve safety, the game will now detect symbolic links used inside world directory. For a detailed explanation, check our [help article](https://aka.ms/MinecraftSymLinks).

-   If the target of a symbolic link is not on the user-configured allow-list, the game will not proceed with loading the world
    -   Note: world directory itself can still be linked
-   The list of allowed symbolic link targets is stored in file `allowed_symlinks.txt` in client or server top directory
-   The file consists of entries (one per line) with following formats allowed:
    -   Lines starting with `#` are comments and are ignored
    -   `[type]pattern`, where `type` can be `glob`, `regex` or `prefix`
        -   `prefix` matches start of path with given pattern (so for `/test` paths `/test`, `/test/` and `/test/foo.txt` would match)
        -   `regex` matches regular expression against whole path
        -   `glob` uses OS-specific path matching mechanism (for example `*.txt` would usually match files with `txt` extension)
        -   Note: paths will use OS-specific separators
    -   `pattern`, which uses default `prefix` type

## Fixed bug in 1.20 Pre-release 7

-   [MC-257778](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-257778) Bamboo Mosaic Slabs and Stairs are not in the #slabs and #stairs block and item tags

---

# Minecraft 1.20 Pre-Release 6

The sixth pre-release of the 1.20 update is here, yet again containing more bug fixes.

Happy mining!

## Technical Changes

-   `"item": "minecraft:air"` can no longer be used in datapack recipes
-   Ingredients in array form are now also allowed in `smithing_trim` and `smithing_transform` recipes on fields `template`, `base` and `addition`
    -   Those fields also allow empty arrays, which signalize that slot needs to be left empty

### Loot tables

#### Random sequences

The ID of the random sequence is now an optional field. If no sequence name is given, loot is drawn using a non-deterministic random source.

## Fixed bugs in 1.20 Pre-Release 6

-   [MC-237042](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-237042) Killing players in the sneaking state that have their sneak option set to "Toggle" in their accessibility settings, results in other players not being able to see them in this state when they respawn
-   [MC-241326](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-241326) Thomas Guimbretière's name is listed twice and misspelt in the credits
-   [MC-260411](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-260411) Re-summoned dragons don't spawn end gateways when exiting the world before killing the dragon
-   [MC-262340](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-262340) Iron Golems can spawn on transparent blocks
-   [MC-262575](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-262575) Company names are still inconsistent in the credits
