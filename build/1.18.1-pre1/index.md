We're now releasing the first pre-release for Minecraft 1.18.1. This will be a fairly small release that will fix a few stability issues and a few bugs. We aim to release this version at the end of next week.

Happy mining!

# Technical Changes in 1.18.1 Pre-Release 1

-   Fixed an issue that would cause players on low-bandwidth connections to get timeout errors when connecting to a server
-   World fog now starts further away from the player, to make distant terrain more visible
-   Instead of applying fog as a spherical volume it is now applied as a cylindrical volume

# Fixed Bugs in 1.18.1 Pre-Release 1

-   [MC-219507](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-219507) - Beacon's power reverts back to previous one on world reload
