# Minecraft Snapshot 22w16a

A chance to re-live the good old times appears in snapshot 22w16a with the ability to de-fragment a Disc - a new Music Disc, to be precise! This snapshot also comes with even more new music, tweaks to the Allay and to top it off it makes some random gameplay events slightly more predictable.

Enjoy!

## New Features in 22w16a

### Predictability of randomized events

Some randomized events are now more predictable and no longer have a possibility of extreme behaviors.

-   Velocity of Horses spawned from skeleton traps

# Minecraft Snapshot 22w15a

Let me tell you a little story about hubris. Well, not so much a story as a lament. Because some of you have been thinking that the warden was a little too easy. I won’t name names, but I know you’re out there. Why else would we be adding ranged attacks for this already terrifying mob? Was the sniffing not enough? When will it end? Not today, apparently. Enjoy a new terrifying warden along with more advancements and technical changes.

## New Features in 22w15a

-   Added advancement "When the Squad Hops into Town" for getting each Frog variant on a Lead
-   Added advancement "Sneak 100" for sneaking near a Sculk Sensor or Warden to prevent it hearing you
-   Added a new ranged attack to the Warden.

### Warden Ranged Attack

-   Building up high, hiding behind walls or being out of range of their powerful melee attack will cause Wardens to switch to their ranged attack
    -   Their rib cages will open up to shriek a sonically charged ranged attack that can penetrate walls

## Changes in 22w15a

-   Added Darkness effect to "How Did We Get Here?" advancement
-   Allays have a natural health regen of 2 health per second
-   The main menu background now shows a Wild Update panorama
-   Mud generates all the way from the surface down to stone in Mangrove Swamps
-   Tall Mangroves are far more common than Short Mangroves in Mangrove Swamps
-   Moss Carpet generates on top of Mangrove Tree's roots
-   The Wandering Trader will now sometimes offer Propagules for sale
-   A previous change to Noteblocks that only Wool and Wool Carpets would block the sounds has been reverted
-   Wardens can now sniff you from further away
-   The vertical range Wardens get angry at a target while sniffing is now 20 blocks instead of 6 blocks

### Changes to vibrations

-   Carpets, like Wool blocks, will now dampen the vibrations caused by their placing, breaking or dropping as items
-   Carpets now also dampen the vibrations caused by running and jumping over them

## Technical Changes in 22w15a

-   Removed `item_delivered_to_player` advancement trigger
-   Added `thrown_item_picked_up_by_player` advancement trigger

​- Added `avoid_vibration` advancement trigger

-   Added `sonic_explosion` particle

### Advancements

#### New triggers

##### `thrown_item_picked_up_by_player`

-   Triggered when a player picks up an item that was thrown by an entity
-   Conditions:
    -   `player` - a predicate for the player picking up the item
    -   `entity` - a predicate for the entity that threw the item
    -   `item` - a predicate for the item

##### `avoid_vibration`

-   Triggered when a vibration event is ignored because the source player is holding the sneak key
-   Conditions:
    -   `player` - a player for which this trigger runs

### Game Events

-   Renamed game event tag `ignore_vibrations_on_occluding_block` to `dampenable_vibrations`
-   Added block tag `dampens_vibrations` to indicate blocks which will not trigger vibrations when placed, broken or stepped on
-   Renamed item tag `occludes_vibration_signals` to `dampens_vibrations` item tag as well

# Minecraft Snapshot 22w14a

Mangrove trees! Warm frogs! Mud blocks! More mangrove trees! Today, we’re happy to bring you the most mud-tastic Java snapshot to date!

Sure, it might be our only mud-tastic snapshot to date – but the important thing is that our new biome, mangrove swamp, now is available for testing, along with nitty-gritty features like the recovery compass and other, more technical tidbits.

Enjoy!

## New Features in 22w14a

-   Added Clay renewability
-   Added Mangrove Trees
-   Added Mangrove Swamp biome
-   Added Echo Shard and Recovery Compass

### Clay renewability

-   Placing Mud above a block that has Pointed Dripstone underneath will eventually turn the mud block into Clay

### Mangrove trees

Introducing a new type of water-adapted tree that spawns propped up on roots

-   Have a chance of spawning a Bee Nest
-   Grows from Mangrove Propagules

### Mangrove Swamp

Muddy! Murky! Magnificent! Welcome to the newest biome - the Mangrove Swamp

-   Located in warmer, more humid places where you'd normally find the Swamp biome in Minecraft
-   Here you can find Bees and Warm Frogs
-   The floor of this biome is coated with a thick layer of Mud, so be sure to pack your best boots
-   Have a nice boat ride under and around the larger-than-life roots of mangrove trees

### Recovery Compass

A new Recovery Compass can be crafted with Echo Shards which can only be found and are unique to Ancient City chests

-   Unlike a normal Compass, the Recovery Compass will point to the last place you died
-   If you are not in the dimension you last died, or you haven't died yet in your world, it will randomly spin
-   It can be crafted with 1 Compass surrounded by 8 Echo Shards, which can be found in Ancient Cities

## Changes in 22w14a

-   The Warden will now get angry at ALL living mobs that bump into it, not just players

## Technical Changes in 22w14a

-   `CatType` fields on enitites with type `minecraft:cat` have been replaced with `variant`, with numeric values being replaced with string ids (so, for example, `5` becomes `minecraft:calico`)
-   Some mutually exclusive tests in entity predicate (`player`, `fishing_hook`, `lightning_bolt` and `catType`) have been collapsed to `type_specific` field
-   Added `item_delivered_to_player` advancement trigger
-   Added `allay_drop_item_on_block` advancement trigger

### Predicates

#### Entity predicate

-   `player`, `fishing_hook`, `lightning_bolt` and `catType` fields have been replaced with `type_specific`
-   `type_specific` has field `type` (one of `player`, `fishing_hook`, `lightning_bolt` or `cat`) and same fields as removed fields
-   Example:
    
    -   Before:
    
         "lightning_bolt": {
           "blocks_set_on_fire": 0
         }
        
    
    -   After
    
          "type_specific": {
            "type": "lightning",
            "blocks_set_on_fire": 0
          }
        
    
-   `catType` has been wrapped to match new format and now uses new cat variant names instead of texture names:
    
    -   Before
    
         "catType": "minecraft:textures/entity/cat/british_shorthair.png"
        
    
    -   After
    
         "type_specific": {
            "type": "cat",
            "variant": "minecraft:british"
         }
        
    
-   New `type_specific` options:
    -   `frog` has `variant` field matching frog variant (`minecraft:warm`, `minecraft:temperate` or `minecraft:cold`)
    -   `slime` applies for slimes and magma creams, has `size` field matching slime size (smallest is `1`)

### Advancements

-   Removed field `location` from triggers `location`, `slept_in_bed`, `hero_of_the_village` and `voluntary_exile` - it was handled exactly the same as `player.location`

#### New triggers

##### `item_delivered_to_player`

-   Triggered when an allay delivers an item to a player
-   Conditions:
    -   `player` - a player for which this trigger runs

##### `allay_drop_item_on_block`

-   Triggered when an allay drops an item on a block
-   Conditions:
    -   `player` - a player for which this trigger runs
    -   `location` - a predicate for the block that the item was dropped on
    -   `item` - a predicate for the item that was dropped

# Minecraft Snapshot 22w13a

**Allay**, the mob that nobody is really sure how to pronounce, is now entering the latest Minecraft: Java Edition snapshot. Along with our new shiny blue friend, we've added the **ancient** **cities**, which have seen some pretty drastic changes since the experimental snapshot a few weeks ago, so make sure you check them out.

Happy mining!

## New Features in 22w13a

-   Added Allay mob
-   Added Ancient Cities

### Allay

-   Allays will collect all the surrounding items that match the item they are holding
-   Allays will like a player who hands them an item and will bring the items they collect to their liked player
-   If the Allay hears a noteblock play, that noteblock becomes the Allay's favorite noteblock for 30 seconds. The Allay will stay near that noteblock for that duration and bring its collected items to the noteblock instead of to the player
-   Interacting with an Allay with an empty hand will remove the item the Allay is holding
-   Allays can be found in Pillager Outposts and Woodland Mansions

### Ancient City

Wander the halls of these long-abandoned structures in the Deep Dark depths to uncover some relics long forgotten.

-   Ancient City structures spawn in the Deep Dark biome
-   In chests, guarded by sculk sensors and shriekers, you can find the new Swift Sneaking enchantment
-   You can also find a new mysterious block called Reinforced Deepslate here, which cannot be obtained in Survival
-   Mobs cannot spawn in Ancient Cities

#### Differences compared to the Experimental Deep Dark snapshot

-   Many adjustments have been made to Ancient Cities, with new and tweaked structures
-   Loot tables have been adjusted for Ancient Cities, including a separate loot table for the "ice box" structures

## Changes in 22w13a

-   The recipes for minecart with chest/furnace/tnt/hopper are now shapeless
-   When broken each minecart variant drops itself as item, instead of splitting into two items (such as chest and minecart)
-   Only wool and wool carpets now block the sounds coming from noteblocks

## Technical Changes in 22w13a

-   Added `kill_mob_near_sculk_catalyst` advancement trigger
-   Sculk shrieker block state changes
-   Renamed some game events

### Advancements

#### New triggers

##### `kill_mob_near_sculk_catalyst`

-   Triggered when a player kills an entity next to Sculk Catalyst
-   Conditions:
    -   `player` - a player for which this trigger runs
    -   `entity` - a predicate for the entity that was killed
    -   `killing_blow` - a predicate for how the entity was killed

### Sculk Shrieker

-   Added `can_summon` blockstate to the Sculk Shrieker that determines whether a Shrieker can summon a Warden or not
-   Shriekers placed via worldgen will have `can_summon` set to true
-   When a Shrieker is placed or generated via Sculk spread, `can_summon` is set to false

### Game Events

Some game events have been renamed, with some of those changes to make them more gramatically consistent:

-   `drinking_finish` -> `drink`
-   `entity_killed` -> `entity_die`
-   `entity_damaged` -> `entity_damage`
-   `elytra_free_fall` -> `elytra_glide`
-   `mob_interact` -> `entity_interact`
-   `ravager_roar` -> `entity_roar`
-   `wolf_shaking` -> `entity_shake`

The following events have been collapsed into `block_activate` and `block_deactivate`:

-   `block_press`
-   `block_unpress`
-   `block_switch`
-   `block_unswitch`

Other miscellaneous changes to game events:

-   `ring_bell` has been removed and replaced with `block_change`
-   Both `shulker_open` and `shulker_close` have been removed in favour of using `container_open` and `container_close`
-   `fishing_rod_cast` and `fishing_rod_reel_in` have been renamed to `item_interact_start` and `item_interact_finish`
-   Added `ignore_vibrations_on_occluding_block` game event tag with subsequent logic
-   `entity_interact` should be dispatched more often when interacting with various mobs

# Minecraft Snapshot 22w12a

Waaaaaaaaaaah! It's Wal... wait that's not it. It's the warden! The spooky, unfriendly (maybe it just wants a hug?) mob is making its way into our latest snapshot.

Additionally, you'll be seeing some functionality for the sculk shriekers and some fancy new boats (they have chests).

Enjoy!

## New Features in 22w12a

-   Added Darkness mob effect
-   Added Sculk Shrieker functionality
-   Added the Warden mob
-   Added boat with chest
-   Added the Swift Sneak enchantment

### Sculk Shrieker

-   Added functionality to the Sculk Shrieker: Notable for its boney appendages, this block responds to Sculk Sensors detecting vibrations by sending out a warning call to distant Wardens
    -   Watch out when stepping on them, as they will feel that too and send out a call!
-   Initially it may take some time for a Warden to arrive, but you'll hear it responding in the distance...
-   Once it's close enough, a call from the Sculk Shrieker will summon the Warden nearby - be prepared!

Added Warden mob

### Warden

The horror of the Deep Dark! A creature with no eyes, roughly resembling the Sculk that can be found throughout the Deep Dark, the Warden is an unstoppable force of nature that inhabits this biome

-   Just like Sculk Sensors, these terrifying creatures use vibrations as a means to navigate their environment
-   When vibrations aren't enough, they will also use a sense of smell to track down their prey - you can observe them sniffing their surroundings to get closer to unsuspecting players and mobs
-   To add to their myriad of ways to detect you, try not to get too close! If you collide with a Warden, it will notice you
-   In the Deep Dark, Wardens are everywhere - you just can't see them. They slumber beneath your feet, and only dig out when enough Sculk Shriekers have alerted them of your presence
-   Watch your step: the more vibrations a Warden detects, the more angry it will get. You can hear and see this from how fast the souls in its chest are beating
-   Once a mob has pushed beyond the Warden's anger threshold, it will face its prey and roar before charging
-   If, however, you keep the Warden from noticing you or getting angry for 60 seconds, it will dig back underground and despawn
-   They have a special interaction with thrown projectiles
    -   If the Warden receives two projectile vibrations within 5 seconds of one another, it will grow angrier at the shooter
    -   If the Warden receives a projectile vibration more than 5 seconds from the last projectile, it will not grow angrier at the shooter
    -   This allows you to strategically distract the Warden without it getting angry while you take loot from nearby chests
-   Unfortunately for all players, Wardens will also disable shields when they hit them with their fists
-   They do not drop any loot
-   Wardens are powerful creatures, and it is often better to sneak around one that has emerged instead of taking it head on - you've been warned

### Darkness

-   A new mob effect unique to the Warden and Sculk Shrieker, which will afflict you with it when nearby
-   Lowers the gamma down at an equivalent of "Moody" while having this effect
-   In periodic pulses, will lower the overall brightness of the world so that the darkness creeps up against light sources
-   When the Warden is around, torches will be more important than ever!
-   A new Accessibility slider has been added in your Options menu called “Darkness Pulsing”
    -   Controls how dark the Darkness effect gets when a Warden or Sculk Shrieker gives it to you, but will not affect the fog distance

### Boat with chest

-   Lets you bring more stuff on your boat adventures
-   If you are in the boat, press the open inventory key to access the chest contents
-   If you are not in the boat, shift-right click to access the chest contents
-   If you break the boat the chest contents will spill out, like with other chests
-   Also works with hoppers, droppers, and other blocks that interact with chests
-   Like other chests, opening a boat chest or breaking the boat will anger piglins, since they think all chests belong to them

### Swift Sneak

Imbue your leggings with this shiny new enchantment to move as fast while crouching as you would normally walk!

-   When applied, it will increase your movement speed while sneaking
-   Has 3 different levels with different speed increases
-   It is the first enchantment unique to leggings equipment!

## Changes in 22w12a

-   The Deep Dark biome is now less flooded than surrounding areas
-   Leaves are now waterloggable
-   Removed debug hotkey cycling render distance
