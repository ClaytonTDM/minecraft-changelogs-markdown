# Minecraft Snapshot 23w42a

Hey! Today we bring you the first of the features we've shown you during Minecraft Live last weekend: the Crafter!

## Experimental Features

### Crafter

-   The Crafter is a new block that enables the crafting of items and blocks via Redstone
-   The Crafter will eject one crafted item at a time when powered by a new Redstone signal / pulse (not a continuous signal)
-   Upon receiving this new signal, the Crafter will eject the recipe result from the front face
-   If the output result has multiple type of items all the result items will be ejected together
-   The Crafter can be oriented in any direction when placed

**Crafter UI**

-   The Crafter has a 3x3 interactable crafting grid
-   The Crafter’s crafting grid slots are toggleable, meaning that the player can change the behavior of a slot by clicking or pressing on a slot with an empty hand
-   A slot that is ‘toggled’ cannot hold any items, and therefore cannot have items placed into it by other blocks, such as Hoppers and Droppers
-   Unlike the Crafting Table, the Crafter displays a preview of the crafted item which will be crafted and ejected on the next Redstone pulse but cannot be manually taken out by the player
-   The Crafter UI is shared between all players interacting with the Crafter, meaning that multiple players can interact with the Crafter at the same time, similar to Chests and Hoppers

**Crafter interaction with other blocks**

-   The Comparator signal strength is 0-9, where each non-empty or toggled slot adds 1 strength
-   Hoppers can be used to both insert and pull out items from the Crafter
-   Droppers can be used to insert items into the Crafter
-   Moving items in from another block (ex: Hopper, Dropper) prioritizes filling items into slots following these rules:
    -   Prioritize the first empty slot (from left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
    -   If there are no empty slots then prioritize the smallest stack of the same item (pick the first if there are multiple)
    -   If there is a toggled slot it will be skipped. The item will then be moved into the container
    -   If the item cannot be moved, it will be ejected into the world

We want to hear your feedback on the Crafter, so please let us know what you think the over in our dedicated [feedback thread](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/20459106029709-Let-s-talk-about-the-Crafter-).

## Changes

-   Added an accessibility option that allows to hide the yellow splash texts in the main menu
-   Added a recovery screen for worlds with missing data (for example, if saving failed due to an unexpected shutdown)

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 21
-   The Resource Pack version is now 19
-   Minor changes to chat component serialization

### Chat components

**Serialization**

-   The optional `type` field has a new allowed value: `selector`
-   Components of type `nbt` now have `source` field with allowed values `entity`, `block`, `storage`

## Data Pack Version 21

-   Introduced Jigsaw structure pool aliases, which can be used to rewire pool selection
-   Added field `block_state` to `tnt` entity to allow replacement of rendered block model
-   Renamed field `Fuse` to `fuse` on `tnt` entity
-   Added `playersNetherPortalDefaultDelay` and `playersNetherPortalCreativeDelay` gamerules to control time (in ticks) that a player needs to stand in a Nether portal before changing dimensions
-   Added new gamerule `projectilesCanBreakBlocks` to control whether impact projectiles will destroy blocks that are destructible by them, i.e. Chorus Flowers, Pointed Dripstone and Decorated Pots
-   Added `white_smoke` particle type

### Jigsaw pool aliases

-   Added optional `pool_aliases` list to Jigsaw structures
-   Aliases represent the possibility to rewire Jigsaw pool connections by redirecting pool references on individual structure instances
-   Alias variants are represented in `type` and is one of:
    -   `direct` 1:1 mapping from an alias to a new pool
        -   `alias` pool to replace
        -   `target` pool to replace with
    -   `random` 1:n mapping where a pool from `n` is randomly selected for the structure instance
        -   `alias` pool to replace
        -   `targets` randomized list of candidate pools to replace `alias` with
    -   `random_group`
        -   `groups` each group is a randomized list of above alias types
        -   only one group is selected per structure instance
        -   this enables modelling selections such as "if pool X is replaced with X1, also replace pool Y with Y1"

## Resource Pack Version 19

-   Added block model, item model and block state definitions for `crafter`
-   Added GUI container texture and sprites for `crafter`
-   Added `white_smoke` particle definition

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w41a

For this week's Snapshot, we've made improvements to the Decorated Pots!

Additionally, Realms is now available in Snapshots moving forward! Any player who has an active Realms subscription is eligible to create a free Snapshot Realm. This Snapshot Realm will be separate from your regular Realm to prevent any issues from impacting your regular Realm. For more information on how Snapshot Realms work, please see Realms in [Minecraft: Java Edition Snapshot FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/20143730191245).

### Decorated Pots

-   Decorated Pots now store up to a single stack of items
-   Hoppers, Hopper Minecarts and Droppers can now insert and/or extract items from Decorated Pots
-   Comparators can now read the number of items in Decorated Pots
-   Players can interact with Decorated Pots to insert items into them
-   Decorated Pots have no GUI, and need to be broken to retrieve or discover their content by players
-   Player interactions with Decorated Pots cause the Decorated Pot to wobble and trigger the vibration frequency of 11
-   Decorated Pots can be smashed by projectiles which cause them to shatter and drop their content
-   Decorated Pots now stack up to 64

We want to hear your feedback on these improvements to Decorated Pots - let us know what you think in [our dedicated feedback site post](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/20289952762637-Let-s-talk-about-Decorated-Pot-improvements-)!

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 20
-   The name of non-living entities will now be shown if looked at and a CustomName is set, or always displayed if CustomNameVisible is set, similar to living entities

## Data Pack Version 20

-   Changed `function` command results
-   Adjusted check for gamerule `maxCommandChainLength`
-   Added new gamerule `maxCommandForkCount`
-   Reintroduced form of the `execute` command: `execute if function`
-   Reintroduced form of the `return` command: `return run`
-   Decorated Pots with `cracked` state set to true will always shatter when broken
-   Added new `dust_plume` particle type

### Commands

**Functions**

-   `function` command has been changed to better accomodate new `return` command
-   Functions no longer have any result unless they use `return` or there was error during lookup or instantiation
    -   That means `function` command will no longer return (or even display) number of commands run during execution
    -   Error conditions:
        -   Calling non-existent function
        -   Calling empty function tag
        -   Macro instantiation failure
-   "Result" in this context means values that would be stored with `execute store`
-   The previous behavior where every command in function would perform store if a function was called with `execute store ... run function` is removed
    -   That means that a single call to `function` will store at most once (zero times if `return` was not called)
    -   For function tags with multiple entries, function results will be accumulated, but partial results will be stored at the end of every function

**Limits**

Existing limits for functions have been refined to accomodate new execution rules and prevent wider range of exploits:

-   Limits apply even if run from command line (so it will now always behave as if they were placed in a function)
    -   For example, all functions called by `execute as @e run function` will count towards same limit
    -   Executions from command blocks still count as separate ones
-   Limit `maxCommandChainLength` for functions will now count "operations" like:
    -   execution of command for a single context
    -   execution of a stage in `execute` (no matter how many contexts were modified)
    -   invocation of function
-   New limit with game rule `maxCommandForkCount` now restricts total amount of context that can be created by single state of functions like `execute`
    -   Example: if there are 5 entities in world, `execute as @e` creates 5 contexts, while `execute as @e at @e` creates 5;;*;;5 = 25 contexts

**`execute if function`**

An `execute` sub-command that runs a function or function tag and matches the return value(s). This is a reintroduction of functionality removed in previous version. If a tag is given, all functions run regardless of the results of prior functions.

Syntax: `execute if|unless function <function> <continuation>`

Parameters:

-   `function`: The function or tag to run

**Matching**

The matching of the result value of the function(s) that run:

-   At least one of the functions must succeed for the match to succeed
-   A succeessful call is defined as a function that:
    -   Uses the `return` command to return a value
    -   The return value is not 0
-   If no functions exited with `return`, neither `if` or `unless` will run

**`return run`**

A form of the `return` command is now available, `return run`. This is a reintroduction of functionality removed in previous version.

Syntax: `return run <command>`

This takes the `result` value from running the specified `command` and returns that as the return value of the function.

-   If command did not return any value (like, for example, call to a `function` without `return`), return will not execute and function will continue execution
-   If the given command fails, the return value is `0`
-   In all other aspects, it works like `return` with a specified return value
-   In case of fork (for example `return run execute as @e run some_command`) the first execution of the command will return
    -   If there are no executions (for example in `return run execute if @e[something_impossible] run some_command`) function will not return and will continue execution

# Minecraft 1.20.2 Pre-Release 1

Are you pre-pared for Pre-release 1 of 1.20.2? Moving into pre-releases means that, moving forward, you won't see any significant changes besides bug fixes and tweaks until the next snapshot cycle. It also means that we will be releasing more frequently than just Wednesdays, so keep your eyes peeled! However, Pre-release 1 brings new changes to the 'Villager Trade Rebalance' experiment, updates to Recipe Book search, command changes, and a new game rule!

Happy crafting!

## Changes

-   The Recipe Book search has been updated with the following changes:
    -   The search will only match the beginning of any word in the item's name
        -   For example, searching for "tor" will still show Torch and Redstone Torch but not Daylight Detector anymore
    -   All recipes, including those that have not been unlocked, will now show up in search results
    -   This will enable experienced players to find the recipes they are looking for (even if it hasn't been unlocked yet) without overwhelming new players
-   Updated structure icons on explorer maps sold by Cartographers
-   When villagers unlock new trades, the order of those trades in the UI is now always random instead of sometimes being deterministic

## Technical Changes

-   The data pack version is now 18
-   Client options are now sent during the configuration network phase when joining a server

### Data Pack Version 18

This data pack version removes the recently introduced `execute if function` and `return run` functionality. Flaws with those commands (see bugs [MC-264595](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-264595), [MC-264699](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-264699) and [MC-264710](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-264710)) require some substantial changes to fix, which we do not want to make close to a release.

These commands will instead be reintroduced early in the next snapshot series when we can take the time to iterate on and test them together with pack makers.

-   Removed `execute if|unless function` command form
-   Removed `return run` command form
-   Numbers used as macro arguments are now always inserted without suffixes, regardless of numeric type
-   Added game rule `enderPearlsVanishOnDeath`, controlling whether thrown ender pearls vanish when the player that threw them dies (default `true`)

## Experimental Features

### Villager Trade Rebalance Part 2

This pre-release updates the Villager Trade Rebalance experiment. This experiment has no effect on normal worlds. If you want to try these changes, you must turn on the Feature Toggle in the Experiments Menu when creating a new world. You can find more information about Feature Toggles [here](https://www.minecraft.net/article/testing-new-minecraft-features/feature-toggles-java-edition).

Thank you to everyone that has sent in their suggestions and feedback regarding the experimental trade change! We are trying out these changes to rebalance the villager trade system and make it more fair and fun for everyone. However, these changes are not yet final, and they will stay as experimental features while we continue to work on them. We appreciate your feedback on these changes. Visit [this link](https://aka.ms/VillagerTradingFeedback) to share your thoughts! We have been following the discussions about the previous Librarian and Wandering Trader updates and look forward to seeing the conversation continue.

**Cartographer**

Before now, Cartographers only sold maps to the Ocean Monument and Woodland Mansion. In this experiment Cartographers can sell seven new maps as well. These new maps each point to a different village or structure and can be used to find seven different biomes. This will help players who want to quickly find a specific location without waiting until they come across it by chance.

Cartographers from different biomes will sell a different selection of maps. Starting from one village, it will be possible to find every other village type by following maps from village to village.

Cartographers now sell 7 new maps: Desert Village Map, Jungle Explorer Map, Plains Village Map, Savanna Village Map, Snow Village Map, Swamp Explorer Map, and Taiga Village Map.

**Armorer**

The Armorer's trades have been updated with many changes.

The biggest change is that buying diamond armor now requires paying a small amount of Diamonds as well as Emeralds. This is meant to make the Armorer's diamond armor trades less useful at the start of the game when players don't have any Diamonds, while still giving a powerful advantage to advanced players who have spent some time collecting Diamonds.

Early-game players will find Armorers useful as a great source of iron armor, Shields and Emeralds.

Other changes include:

-   Most master-level Armorers buy Iron Blocks (and pay very well for them)
-   Chainmail armor is exclusively sold by the secret Jungle and Swamp Armorers
-   The Savanna Armorer sells cursed diamond armor at reduced prices
-   The Taiga Armorer can swap one piece of diamond armor for another

**Structure Loot**

Certain Enchanted Books now have a high chance of generating in some structures:

-   Ancient Cities: Mending
-   Mineshafts: Efficiency (I to V)
-   Pillager Outposts: Quick Charge (I to III)
-   Desert Temples: Unbreaking (I to III)
-   Jungle Temples: Unbreaking (I to III)
