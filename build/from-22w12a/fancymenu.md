# Minecraft Snapshot 22w12a

Waaaaaaaaaaah! It's Wal... wait that's not it. It's the warden! The spooky, unfriendly (maybe it just wants a hug?) mob is making its way into our latest snapshot.

Additionally, you'll be seeing some functionality for the sculk shriekers and some fancy new boats (they have chests).

Enjoy!

## New Features in 22w12a

-   Added Darkness mob effect
-   Added Sculk Shrieker functionality
-   Added the Warden mob
-   Added boat with chest
-   Added the Swift Sneak enchantment

### Sculk Shrieker

-   Added functionality to the Sculk Shrieker: Notable for its boney appendages, this block responds to Sculk Sensors detecting vibrations by sending out a warning call to distant Wardens
    -   Watch out when stepping on them, as they will feel that too and send out a call!
-   Initially it may take some time for a Warden to arrive, but you'll hear it responding in the distance...
-   Once it's close enough, a call from the Sculk Shrieker will summon the Warden nearby - be prepared!

Added Warden mob

### Warden

The horror of the Deep Dark! A creature with no eyes, roughly resembling the Sculk that can be found throughout the Deep Dark, the Warden is an unstoppable force of nature that inhabits this biome

-   Just like Sculk Sensors, these terrifying creatures use vibrations as a means to navigate their environment
-   When vibrations aren't enough, they will also use a sense of smell to track down their prey - you can observe them sniffing their surroundings to get closer to unsuspecting players and mobs
-   To add to their myriad of ways to detect you, try not to get too close! If you collide with a Warden, it will notice you
-   In the Deep Dark, Wardens are everywhere - you just can't see them. They slumber beneath your feet, and only dig out when enough Sculk Shriekers have alerted them of your presence
-   Watch your step: the more vibrations a Warden detects, the more angry it will get. You can hear and see this from how fast the souls in its chest are beating
-   Once a mob has pushed beyond the Warden's anger threshold, it will face its prey and roar before charging
-   If, however, you keep the Warden from noticing you or getting angry for 60 seconds, it will dig back underground and despawn
-   They have a special interaction with thrown projectiles
    -   If the Warden receives two projectile vibrations within 5 seconds of one another, it will grow angrier at the shooter
    -   If the Warden receives a projectile vibration more than 5 seconds from the last projectile, it will not grow angrier at the shooter
    -   This allows you to strategically distract the Warden without it getting angry while you take loot from nearby chests
-   Unfortunately for all players, Wardens will also disable shields when they hit them with their fists
-   They do not drop any loot
-   Wardens are powerful creatures, and it is often better to sneak around one that has emerged instead of taking it head on - you've been warned

### Darkness

-   A new mob effect unique to the Warden and Sculk Shrieker, which will afflict you with it when nearby
-   Lowers the gamma down at an equivalent of "Moody" while having this effect
-   In periodic pulses, will lower the overall brightness of the world so that the darkness creeps up against light sources
-   When the Warden is around, torches will be more important than ever!
-   A new Accessibility slider has been added in your Options menu called “Darkness Pulsing”
    -   Controls how dark the Darkness effect gets when a Warden or Sculk Shrieker gives it to you, but will not affect the fog distance

### Boat with chest

-   Lets you bring more stuff on your boat adventures
-   If you are in the boat, press the open inventory key to access the chest contents
-   If you are not in the boat, shift-right click to access the chest contents
-   If you break the boat the chest contents will spill out, like with other chests
-   Also works with hoppers, droppers, and other blocks that interact with chests
-   Like other chests, opening a boat chest or breaking the boat will anger piglins, since they think all chests belong to them

### Swift Sneak

Imbue your leggings with this shiny new enchantment to move as fast while crouching as you would normally walk!

-   When applied, it will increase your movement speed while sneaking
-   Has 3 different levels with different speed increases
-   It is the first enchantment unique to leggings equipment!

-   The Deep Dark biome is now less flooded than surrounding areas
-   Leaves are now waterloggable
-   Removed debug hotkey cycling render distance

# Minecraft Snapshot 22w11a

Minecraft: Java Edition is jumping on the Wild Update train! The first snapshot for 1.19 is now available. It contains frogs, the Deep Dark, and a bunch of new blocks. We've also entered the era of 3D directional audio. Keeping up with the times!

Happy mining!

## New Features in 22w11a

-   Added the Deep Dark biome
-   Added Frogs & Tadpoles
-   Added mangrove blocks
-   Added mud and mud brick blocks
-   Added Sculk, Sculk Veins, Sculk Shrieker and Sculk Catalyst blocks
-   Added 3D Directional Audio option

### Deep Dark

Dig into the depths far underground to uncover the darkest biome in Minecraft - the Deep Dark.

-   Dimly lit and eerie, the Deep Dark is sure to strike fear into the hearts of even the most brave player
-   The floor of the Deep Dark is covered in sculk
-   No mobs spawn in the Deep Dark

### Frog

-   Frogs can jump
-   Frogs can swim
-   Frogs can walk on land
-   Frogs can croak
-   Frogs can eat small slimes, causing a slime ball to drop
-   Frogs can eat small Magma Cubes, causing a Froglight block to drop
-   Each Frog variant drops a specific Froglight Block
-   Three Froglight blocks are added, a lightsource block

### Tadpoles

-   Tadpoles can swim in water
-   Tadpoles on land "jump around" like fishes on land, and eventually dies
-   Tadpoles that grows up turns into a Frog
-   Tadpoles grow into a different type of frog based on the biome they are born in (Cold, Temperate, Warm)
-   Tadpoles can be caught in a bucket

### Mangrove wood blocks

Added a new type of wood: Mangrove! Mangrove biome + mangrove trees are coming in a later snapshot.

-   Mangrove log and stripped mangrove log
-   Mangrove wood and stripped mangrove wood
-   Mangrove roots and muddy mangrove roots
-   Mangrove boat, button, pressure plate, door, trapdoor, sign, slab, fence, fence gate, and stairs

### Mangrove leaves and propagules

-   Mangrove propagule is a sapling that grows from the bottom of mangrove leaves
-   Bonemealing mangrove leaves will cause a new propagule to start growing beneath it
-   Propagules grow through 4 stages, and growth can be accelerated by bonemealing
-   You can break off a fully grown propagule and plant it like a sapling. For now it will grow in an oak tree, but will of course grow into a mangrove tree when that is done.

### Mud

-   Mud is a block that will generate in the upcoming Mangrove biome.
-   When walking on mud, entities sink down a bit. Like soul sand, but without the slowdown.
-   Mud can be created by using a water bottle on dirt, by hand or with a dispenser.
-   Packed mud can be crafted from mud

### Mud bricks

-   Mud bricks are a building block that can be crafted from packed mud
-   Mud bricks can be crafted into Mud brick stairs, walls, and slabs using a crafting table or stonecutter.

### Sculk

The rattling tendrils of the Sculk Sensors had to come from somewhere, right? Introducing Sculk, a new family of blocks that dwells in the Deep Dark.

-   Added Sculk Catalyst block, a mysteriously soul-emitting block that blooms with Sculk patches underneath nearby dying mobs
    -   Mobs that perish in the presence of the catalyst will not drop their experience
-   Added Sculk blocks
    -   When a mob dies near a Sculk Catalyst, some unknown process seems to consume blocks beneath and turn them into Sculk blocks
    -   Sculk charge when spreading will have a chance to grow certain blocks, like Sculk Sensors on top of it, consuming its charge.
-   Added Sculk Vein blocks
    -   These veins are found on the edge of Sculk patches
    -   Similar to Glow Lichen, they can be placed in any orientation
    -   Spreading of veins causes other blocks to be taken over by the sculk
    -   Sculk Vein can spread underwater
-   Added Sculk Shrieker block.
    -   Sculk Shriekers can be found growing rarely from the charge of a Sculk Catalyst
    -   Sculk Shrieker can be waterlogged
    -   Sculk Shrieker requires Silk Touch to obtain otherwise drops experience when mined
-   Souls from mobs will spread through Sculk Veins and Sculk Blocks in random directions until

they find a valid substrate they can feed of off - The charge from souls in the Sculk Blocks and Sculk Veins will eventually decay, but it will decay much, much slower in the close vicinity of the Sculk Catalyst, and much faster away from its host - If the charge is dropped outside the range of the Catalyst, it has a chance of growing a Sculk Sensor

-   Sculk, Sculk Veins and Sculk Catalysts require Silk Touch to acquire. Otherwise, they drop experience when mined
-   The efficient tool for all Sculk family blocks is the Hoe

### 3D Directional Audio

-   Added sound option for 3D Directional Audio simulation
-   This option is best experienced with headphones

## Technical Changes in 22w11a

-   The data pack format is now 10
-   The resource pack format is now 9
-   Added 3D Blending
-   Added new font glyph provider for spaces
-   Added estimated GPU utilization percentage to performance profiling metrics and F3 debug screen
    -   This is only available for graphics devices that support GPU timer queries
-   Added ability for data and resource packs to selectively hide files from packs below them
-   World presets/types and flat world presets in "Create World" screen can now be controlled by datapacks
-   Added server property `max-chained-neighbor-updates` to limit the amount of consecutive neighbor updates before skipping additional ones. Negative values remove the limit.

### Blending

-   Blending now support 3d biome blending, so it will blend the underground biomes as well.
-   Removed `blending_data.old_noise`, now existence of `blending_data` in chunk data determines if a chunk is considered old
-   Added `blending_data.min_section` and `blending_data.max_section` that determines which sections will be used for data for blending

### Space glyph provider

-   New glyph provider type `space` is added to allow creation of space-like glyphs
-   New provider has single argument called `advances` which is map of codepoint to glyph advance (width)
-   Rendering of space glyph is not longer hardcoded (needs to be declared manually in font)

### Pack filters

-   Data and resource packs can have `filter` section in `pack.mcmeta`.
-   This section has mandatory field `block`, which is a list of patterns (regular expressions) for namespaces and paths.
-   If any of files in packs added before one with `filter` section matches any pattern inside `block`, it will be filtered out (i.e. treated as if it wasn't present in the first place).
-   `filter` section does not apply to a pack containing it - only to packs loaded before it.
-   Both `namespace` and `path` can be omited. Missing field matches every value.
-   For example, adding pack with this section in `pack.mcmeta` after vanilla pack will hide all recipes and advancements defined by vanilla pack

    "filter": {
        "block": [
            {
                "namespace": "minecraft",
                "path": "recipes/.*"
            },
            {
                "namespace": "minecraft",
                "path": "advancements/.*"
            }
        ]
    }
    

### World presets

-   New registry types `worldgen/world_preset` and `worldgen/flat_level_generator_preset` were added to data-drive presents (like "Amplified" or "Single Biome")
-   Two tags for world presets added (`normal` and `alternative`) to control values show on "World Type" button in "Create World" screen
-   One tag added for flat world presents (`visible`) to control order of elements displayed in "Configure Flat World" screen
-   World presets can also be used as a value of `level-type` in `server.properties`

### Predicates

-   The `feature` field in location predicates is now called `structure`

# Minecraft 1.18.2 Pre-Release 1

We're now releasing the first pre-release for Minecraft 1.18.2. This pre-release introduces the possibility for data packs to customize cave generation and to add new custom structures to worlds.

If everything goes as expected, we aim to release this version on February 28th.

Happy mining!

## Changes in 1.18.2 Pre-release 1

-   Users running Minecraft in a 32-bit environment will receive a warning in the main menu about the upcoming end of 32-bit environment support

## Technical Changes in 1.18.2 Pre-release 1

-   The data pack version is now 9
-   It is now possible to add custom structures in experimental datapacks
-   `locate` and `locatebiome` commands now support tags (prefix with `#` to distinguish from normal ids)
-   The `locate` command parameter is now a configured structure rather than a structure type. For instance, you can now use `/locate village_desert` or `/locate shipwreck_beached`
-   A lot of the cave generation is now configurable through data packs

### Configurable caves

-   A new registry was added for Density functions (caves are created by combining those together)
-   Noise settings got a new field `noise_router` (and lost a couple of flags), see `worldgen/noise_settings` folder in the worldgen report
-   Noise router wires data-driven parts of the cave generation with the rest of the code

### Configured Structures and Structure Sets

The game now generates and stores data-driven configured structures.

-   Experimental datapacks can add new structure sets
-   The `feature` field in location predicates now references a configured feature
-   The `exploration_map` loot table function `destination` field is now a configured feature tag id
-   The `exploration_map` loot table function no longer automatically sets the display name of the map

**Side effects**

Some gameplay oddities have been affected by this change.

-   Dolphins will now more accurately pick the closest structure regardless of type
-   Bastion Remnant bounding boxes are now slightly more accurate to the shape of the structure

## Fixed bugs in 1.18.2 Pre-release 1

-   [MC-3524](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-3524) Structure related mobs do not spawn in flat type world generation
-   [MC-146854](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-146854) Player movement favors x axis when in a corner
-   [MC-179315](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-179315) Ruined portals never generate in superflat worlds by default

# Minecraft Snapshot 22w06a

Today we're happy to share snapshot 22w06a with you. It contains compliance updates for South Korean players and is Totally Teeming with Technical Tag Tastiness.

Happy Mining (in moderation)!

## Changes in 22w06a

If you’re playing in South Korea, we added gameplay timers and notices in compliance with gaming laws to help remind players to take occasional breaks from gameplay. For more information, please see [the FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/articles/360052763631).

## Technical Changes in 22w06a

-   Any type present in registries (blocks, items, biomes, etc.) can now have tags

### Universal tags

-   Tags can now be defined for any registry (blocks, items, biomes, etc. - see `registries.json` in report)
-   New tags are stored in datapacks under `tags` directory (same as old ones)
    -   Names of new tag directories are the same as registry names (so `/data/[namespace]/tags/potion` and `/data/[namespace]/tags/worldgen/biome`)
    -   Existing tags (`blocks`, `items`, `fluids`, `entity_types`, `game_events` and `functions`) keep their name (for now)
-   Some fields in worldgen structures that previously only lists of element ids now accept tags
    -   Those entries now accept `[id, ...]`, `id` (shortcut for `[id]`) and `#tag`
    -   Changed fields are:
        -   `feature.glow_lichen` configuration: `can_be_placed_on`
        -   `feature.spring_feature` configuration: `valid_blocks`
        -   `feature.simple_random_selector` configuration: `features`
        -   `block_predicate_type.matching_blocks`: `blocks`
        -   `block_predicate_type.matching_fluids`: `fluids`
        -   `biome`: inner list in `features`, map value in `carvers`
        -   `biome_source.checkerboard`: `biomes`
-   Some tag fields now require id to be prepended with `#` (however they are not yet accepting element list)
    -   `dimension_type`: `infiniburn`
    -   `feature.geode` configration: `blocks.cannot_replace`, `blocks.invalid_blocks`
    -   `feature.vegetation_patch`, `feature.waterlogged_vegetation_patch` configuration: `replaceable`
    -   `feature.root_system` configuration: `root_replaceable`
    -   `structure_processor.protected_blocks`: `value`

## Fixed bugs in 22w06a

-   [MC-105317](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-105317) Structure blocks do not rotate entities correctly when loading
-   [MC-239708](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-239708) Superflat world "Water World" preset settings are obsolete for the 1.18 update

Happy mining!

New command that places a configured feature at a given location. Syntax: `placefeature <id> [pos]`

Parameters:
