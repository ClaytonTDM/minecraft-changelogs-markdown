# Minecraft Snapshot 23w05a

In this snapshot we've tweaked the armor trim feature and redefined the Create New World user experience flow.

Happy world creating!

## Changes

-   Updated the Create New World screen
-   Interacting with armor or elytra items in-hand will now swap them with equipped gear
-   The enchantment glint has been further tweaked to be slower and less visible, but also have more contrast in some intervals

### Accessibility

-   Changed how tooltips in the menu UI are positioned so buttons are still readable
-   Added two new options in the Accessibility menu for adjusting the speed and transparency of enchantment glints

### Updated Create New World Screen

-   The screen is now organized into three tabs
    -   The Game-Tab allows to set the world name, Gamemode, Difficultly and whether to allow cheats
    -   The World-Tab allows to set the World-Type and Seed, and to toggle the generation of structures and the bonus chest
    -   The More-Tab provides access to the Game Rules and DataPack Selection Screen
-   Removed the Import Settings button and the corresponding Export Settings button in the Edit World Screen

## Technical Changes

### Trim Patterns & Materials

-   The following data is now also defined by a trim material:
    -   `override_armor_materials` which is an optional map of armor material to overriden color palette
        -   Map key is the armor material that this trim material wants to override with a different color palette
        -   Map value is the name of the color palette that will be used when this trim material is applied to an armor piece with the corresponding armor material
-   The following data is no longer defined by a trim material:
    -   `incompatible_armor_material`

### Commands

#### `effect`

-   `infinite` is now a valid option for effect durations
    -   Infinite effect durations show up as "âˆž" in the player inventory view

## Experimental Features

-   Armor trims can now be applied to leather armor
-   Armor can now have trims of the same material it is made out of
    -   For example, a Golden Chestplate with a Golden Armor Trim is now possible
-   The texture of the Dune armor trim has been tweaked so that the symbol on the chestplate is moved up a few pixels
-   Loot tables for smithing templates have been adjusted

### Loot tables for smithing templates

-   The following common armor trims now always generate 2 templates in a chest when found:
    -   Dune
    -   Coast
    -   Wild
    -   Sentry
-   This is to give new players a chance to understand that smithing templates are consumed when used
-   Netherite Upgrade smithing templates have been made twice as common
    -   While we do want Netherite upgrading to be more challenging, we felt the previous rates did not encourage further exploration after finding the first Netherite Upgrade template
-   1 Eye Armor Trim is now guaranteed in every Stronghold library chest
    -   This is so even in the most unlucky worlds, this armor trim can still be found
-   Woodland Mansions now have a greatly increased chance of generating the Vex Armor Trim smithing template
    -   Woodland Mansions already have very few chests that utilize loot tables - in unlucky generations, none at all. It was too rare to find one of these trims, and we want the challenge of getting the Vex Armor Trim to be more about finding a Woodland Mansion to begin with
-   Across the board, smithing templates have been made slightly more common
    -   Due to the method of crafting copies of templates, we want the process of discovering another template in a structure to feel like the player has just saved 7 diamonds. If the templates are too rare, this situation does not happen as much, meaning players will not be encouraged to explore more structures

Tuesday is the new Wednesday, did you know? Here is snapshot 23w04a with a new experimental Armor Trim Smithing feature in the Update\_1\_20 experimental pack.

Happy trimming!

## Changes

-   Enchantment glint on items and armor is now more subtle

## Experimental Features

-   Added a new armor trimming system to visually customize your armor
-   Added Smithing Template items
-   Redesigned the Smithing Table
-   Changed how Netherite equipment is crafted

### Smithing Templates

-   Smithing Tables have been redesigned into a workstation for physical equipment upgrades and modifications
-   Alongside slots for combining a piece of equipment and materials, there is now a required slot for an item type called Smithing Templates
-   Smithing Templates define what type of upgrade you will be making to equipment
    -   It specifies both what type of items you can upgrade, and which ingredients are valid to customize the upgrade
    -   There are currently two categories of Smithing Templates: Armor Trim and Netherite Upgrade
-   Smithing Templates are consumed when used to upgrade an item in the Smithing Table
-   You can craft a copy of a Smithing Template in the Crafting Table with 7 diamonds + 1 block of material that the template is made out of + 1 smithing template, which will output 2 of the same Smithing Template

### Netherite Equipment

-   Netherite equipment crafting now also requires a Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template
-   Netherite Upgrade Smithing Templates can be found randomly in all Bastion Remnant chests, and there is a guarantee of 2 in every Treasure Room Bastion Remnant
-   This change was made for a variety of reasons:
    -   Increase the time players utilize Diamond equipment before Netherite
    -   Make Netherite equipment a more significant achievement in the game's progression
    -   Adapt Netherite more naturally into the new Smithing Table crafting system

### Armor Trims

-   You can now visually customize your armor with a variety of unique trims at the Smithing Table
    -   All armor is viable for trims except for leather armor
-   Armor trims are purely visual with no gameplay benefits, and can only be applied to Helmets, Chestplates, Leggings and Boots
    -   All trim patterns are visually the same on an armor's item icon, but the color will still change based on the trim material
    -   To check which trim pattern a piece of armor has, you can hover over it in the inventory
-   Armor Trim Smithing Templates can be found all throughout the world, and each of the following structures contain their own unique Smithing Template:
    -   Pillager Outpost
        -   Sentry Armor Trim
    -   Desert Pyramid
        -   Dune Armor Trim
    -   Shipwreck
        -   Coast Armor Trim
    -   Jungle Temple
        -   Wild Armor Trim
    -   Ocean Monument
        -   Tide Armor Trim
    -   Ancient City
        -   Ward Armor Trim
    -   Woodland Mansion
        -   Vex Armor Trim
    -   Nether Fortress
        -   Rib Armor Trim
    -   Bastion Remnant
        -   Snout Armor Trim
    -   Stronghold
        -   Eye Armor Trim
    -   End City
        -   Spire Armor Trim
-   Smithing Templates are found in chests in their respective structure, except for the Ocean Monument. Instead of finding it in chests, Elder Guardians sometimes drop a Smithing Template upon death
-   Some Armor Trim Smithing Templates are rarer than others, so be on the lookout for them to impress your friends!
-   An armor trim has two properties: a pattern and a material
    -   The pattern is defined by the Smithing Template used to apply the trim, and represents the visual pattern of the trim
    -   The material is defined by what ingredient you used to apply the trim, and represents the color of the trim
-   The viable ingredients you can use to define the color of your armor trim are the following:
    -   Iron
    -   Copper
    -   Gold
    -   Lapis
    -   Emerald
    -   Diamond
    -   Netherite
    -   Redstone
    -   Amethyst
    -   Quartz
-   Armor cannot have the same material it is made of applied to it as a trim
    -   For example, a Golden Chestplate cannot have a Golden Armor Trim

## Technical Changes

-   Added a new type of atlas configuration source: `paletted_permutations`
    
-   Armor Stands now preserve custom names when placed and broken
    
-   A new registry `trim_pattern` has been added for the armor trim system
    
-   A new recipe serializer `smithing_transform` has been added for the updated Netherite Upgrade recipe
    
-   A new recipe serializer `smithing_trim` has been added for the new Armor Trim recipe
    
-   Smithing table has temporarily two menu types
    
    -   Old menu without Smithing Template slot has been renamed to `legacy_smithing`
        -   Will be removed when Armor Trim feature stops being an experimental feature
    -   New menu with Smithing Template slot was added called `smithing`
-   Added new flag (value 128) to `HideFlags` NBT field for hiding armor trim item tooltips
    

### Paletted Permutations

-   `paletted_permutations` is a new type of atlas configuration source used to dynamically generate new textures in memory based on a set of color palettes
-   Color palettes allow you to swap out the colors of a texture without having to supply all files for the variants of a texture in a resource pack
-   This is useful for things like armor trims, where you want to be able to change the color of parts of the armor without having to create a new texture for each color
-   The `paletted_permutations` source has a set of required parameters:
    -   `textures` A list of namespaced locations of base textures
        -   These textures will be used to generate variants of them that have been modified by color palettes
    -   `palette_key` A namespaced location of a color palette key file
        -   A color palette key is used to define the set of key pixel colors we want to swap out with the color palettes defined below
    -   `permutations` A map of permutations from suffix to a namespaced location of a color palette file
        -   The suffix is appended at the beginning to the resource location of the output variant textures, with a `_` character separating the suffix and the base texture name
        -   The color palette is a texture file with a set of pixels that are used for replacing pixels that match the color palette key in each base texture
        -   The number of pixels in each color palette must be the same as that of the `palette_key` defined for this source
        -   Key matching is done by comparing the RGB values of each pixel in the `palette_key` to the RGB values of each pixel in the color palette
        -   Alpha channel is ignored for key matching, but in the resulting texture the alpha channel is multiplied with the color palette's alpha channel
        -   Pixels that do not match the `palette_key` are copied over to the resulting texture as-is
-   After defining a `paletted_permutations` source, you can then reference those namespaced output textures in other resources in your resource pack
    -   For example, if you have the following `paletted_permutations` source:
        
            {
                "type": "paletted_permutations",
                "textures": [
                    "minecraft:item/leather_helmet",
                    "minecraft:item/leather_chestplate",
                    "minecraft:item/leather_leggings",
                    "minecraft:item/leather_boots"
                ],
                "palette_key": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/leather_armor_color_key",
                "permutations": {
                    "red": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/red",
                    "green": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/green",
                    "blue": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/blue"
                }
            }
            
        
    -   You can then reference the resulting textures in other resources like this:
        
            {
                "textures": {
                    "layer0": "minecraft:item/leather_helmet_red",
                    "layer1": "minecraft:item/leather_chestplate_green",
                    "layer2": "minecraft:item/leather_boots_blue"
                }
            }
            
        

### Trim Patterns & Materials

-   Trim patterns and materials for armor are defined by the server through the `trim_pattern` and `trim_material` registry respectively
    -   As a result, new trim patterns and materials can be added via data packs
-   These are synchronized to clients when they join the server
    -   However, clients must have an accompanying resource pack to see those registered trim patterns and materials
    -   The paths to these textures are inferred based on the filename of the pattern json, and will try to find the textures within the same namespace as the trim pattern's `name` field
-   The following data is defined by a trim pattern:
    -   `asset_id` which is a namespaced id used to infer texture locations and localization
    -   `template_item` which is the id of the smithing template item used to apply the trim pattern
    -   `description` which is a text component used for displaying the pattern name of an armor trim when hovering an armor itemstack
-   The following data is defined by a trim material:
    -   `asset_name` which is a string used as a suffix for armor trim texture locations
    -   `ingredient` which is the id of the ingredient item used to apply the trim material
    -   `item_model_index` which is a float which defines the item model override each armor item model should target to change their visuals for this material
    -   `incompatible_armor_material` which is an optional id of the armor material this trim material cannot be applied to
    -   `description` which is a text component used for displaying the material name of an armor trim when hovering an armor itemstack
        -   The style defined in this description is applied to the armor trim pattern `description` as well

### Commands

-   New relation available for `execute on`: `origin`:
    -   shooter, if the executing entity is a projectile (like arrow, fireball, trident, firework, thrown potion, etc.)
    -   thrower, if the executing entity is an item
    -   source of effect, if the executing entity is an area effect cloud
    -   igniter, if the executing entity is a primed tnt
    -   summoner, if the executing entity is evoker fangs or a vex

## Fixed bugs in 23w04a

-   [MC-198809](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-198809) Blast Protection does not reduce explosion knockback except at very high levels
-   [MC-259189](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-259189) "Narrator: Not Available" isn't grayed out on accessibility splash
-   [MC-259204](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-259204) All goat horns display as Ponder goat horns and play the Ponder instrument
-   [MC-259211](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-259211) You cannot select incompatible resource packs within the resource packs menu via keyboard navigation

The clone command now supports specifying the source and target dimensions. New syntax:

`clone [from <sourceDimension>] <begin> <end> [to <targetDimension>] <destination> ...`

Parameters:

-   `sourceDimension`: id of dimension to clone from
-   `targetDimension`: id of dimension to clone to

#### `data`

New source available:

-   `string <entity|block|storage> [path] [start] [end]` - reads a value as text, resulting in a string value

New arguments:

-   `start`: Index of first character to include at the start of the string

Parameters:

-   `pos`: Block position to check
-   `dimension`: A dimension id

##### `execute on`

New `execute` sub-command for selecting entities based on relation to the current executing entity:

-   `execute on <relation>`

Relations:

-   `vehicle` - entity that the executing entity is riding
-   `passengers` - all entities directly riding the executing entity (no sub-passengers)
-   `controller` - entity that is controlling the executing entity (for example: first passenger in a boat)
-   `owner` - owner of the executing entity, if it is a tameable animal (like cats, wolves or parrots)
-   `leasher` - entity leading the executing entity with a leash (might be a leash knot in case of being attached to a fence)

    -   To retain existing functionality, you need to add an `s` suffix to pre-existing commands

#### `ride`

New command to allow entities to start or stop riding other entities

Syntax:

-   `ride <target> mount <vehicle>`
    -   Makes a single target mount a single vehicle
    -   The command will fail if:
        -   `vehicle` is a player
        -   `target` is already riding a vehicle
        -   `target` and `vehicle` are the same entity
        -   `vehicle` is already a passenger (direct or indirect) of `target`
-   `ride <target> dismount`
    -   Dismounts `target` from any vehicle it is riding
    -   Fails if `target` is not riding anything

### Game Rules

-   Added `commandModificationBlockLimit`, controlling the maximum number of blocks changed in one execution of `clone`, `fill` and `fillbiome`

### Chat components

#### Translation fallback

Added an optional `fallback` field to `translate` text components.

-   The new field is a string that will be used in place of translation if it is missing

We are now releasing snapshot 22w46a for Minecraft 1.19.3 with [playable mob sounds](https://www.minecraft.net/article/playable-mob-sounds-coming-minecraft-1-20) added as an experimental feature, improvements for telemetry data and several technical improvements.

Happy mining!

## New Experimental Features in 22w46a

-   Books in Chiseled Bookshelf can be added or removed from any slot by targeting the specific slot

### Mob Heads on Note Blocks interaction

-   When placing a Mob Head on a Note Block, that Note Block will now play one of the ambient sounds of that mob when played by a player or powered by Redstone

### Piglin Mob Head

-   Piglins will now drop their heads when killed by a charged Creeper
-   Placing the Piglin head on a Note Block will play one of the Piglin's ambient sounds
-   The Piglin head will flap its ears when powered by Redstone, or when worn by a player while walking

## Changes in 22w46a

-   In the Nether dimension Endermen, Skeletons and Wither Skeletons now only spawn at light level 7 and below (instead of 11 and below)
    -   This is intended to nerf certain portal-based mob farms
    -   We welcome feedback on this
-   Added new top textures for Block of Bamboo and Block of Stripped Bamboo
-   Bamboo Plank texture has been tweaked to match the same tiling pattern as other plank variants

### Creative Inventory changes

-   Reordered Redstone tab based on feedback
-   Added Rails to the Tools & Utilities tab next to Minecarts

## Technical Changes in 22w46a

-   Blocks carried by Endermen now use loot tables to generate drops when killed
-   Changes to texture loading and stitching
-   Translation files and `pack.mcmeta` are now including non-ASCII characters (encoded as UTF-8) directly instead of using escape sequences
-   Added new Telemetry Events

### Telemetry

This release includes the WorldUnloaded event, a required event, as well as several opt-in events. Diagnostic tracking is a tool that helps us understand what you like about Minecraft, which allows us to make those things better.

The reason that WorldUnloaded, along with [WorldLoaded](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-21w38a), is a required event is that the information weâ€™re looking at is, well, required. As a part of Xbox, we all need to follow a standard of practice, you can find a detailed description of it [here](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement). The parameters for what data we consider to be critical to our work are set by our team at Mojang Studios in alignment with Xbox.

What we want to find out is how fun you think Minecraft is. There are lots of ways to figure that out, like feedback, playtests, experience, and magic. We want to add data to that mix, which is where WorldLoaded and WorldUnloaded come in. WorldLoaded measures when you boot a session up, and WorldUnloaded measures when you shut it down. Together, they will measure how fun Minecraft is, using metrics such as playtime and the game modes that players choose to play. Thatâ€™s it. All the data we collect, whether itâ€™s required or opt-in, follows GDPR and CCPA best practices to keep your information safe.

The rest of the current telemetry events are opt-in, which means that you can choose whether or not you want to send us additional data. The only players that canâ€™t opt-in are Microsoft child accounts, but everyone can still send in all of their feedback to [feedback.minecraft.net](http://feedback.minecraft.net/).

Just like all the thoughts and comments we get from you on our feedback site, this is something that greatly helps us improve Minecraft. We want to make a game that you want to play, so we want to know what that game needs. Even if itâ€™s more lava.

#### Telemetry transparency

-   Added Telemetry Data Collection Screen
    -   This screen displays information about the type of data that is sent
    -   The level of data sent can be controlled between "Minimal" and "All"
        -   "Minimal" sends only the required data
        -   "All" sends the required data, as well as optional data
    -   The default data level is "Minimal" (only the required data)
-   Every telemetry event sent from the client is now logged to disk
    -   Old log files are removed after 7 days
    -   These can be found under the `logs/telemetry` directory
        -   A shortcut to this directory is available via the "Open My Data" button on the Telemetry Data Collection screen

#### Required telemetry events

-   Added WorldUnloaded event
-   Removed client Java version from the WorldLoaded event

##### WorldLoaded & WorldUnloaded

Understanding how Minecraft is played allows us to focus game updates and improvements on the areas that are most relevant to players. The data that tells us this includes game mode, client or server modded status, and game version.

WorldLoaded & WorldUnloaded are two paired events that calculate how long the world session has lasted (in seconds and ticks). Data from WorldLoaded is sent when a world is launched, and data from WorldUnloaded is sent when a world is shut down (quitting to title, disconnecting from a server).

#### Optional telemetry events

-   Added PerformanceMetrics and WorldLoadTimes events

##### PerformanceMetrics

Knowing the overall performance profile of Minecraft helps us tune and optimize the game for a wide range of machine specifications and operating systems.

The periodic performance metrics includes data such as frame-rates, rendering performance, memory usage, operating system, and the modded status of the client and server.

Game version is included to help us compare the performance profile for new versions of Minecraft.

##### WorldLoadTimes

Itâ€™s important for us to understand how long it takes to join a world, and how that changes over time. For example, when we add new features or do larger technical changes, we need to see what impact that had on load times.

This event includes the total time in milliseconds for the world to load, whether this was a new world, as well as game version and platform details.

### Texture loading changes

-   Context: When the game loads all textures used by block and item models need to be stitched (merged) into a single image, called the "atlas"
    -   Individual textures that are stitched onto the atlas are called "sprites"
-   To improve loading performance, block and item textures are now loaded before they are processed by block and item models
    -   By default, textures not in the `textures/item` and `textures/block` directories will no longer be automatically recognized and will fail to load
-   Resource packs can now have configuration files, located in `atlases` directory, that control which images are included in the atlases

#### Atlas configuration files

-   New directory `atlases` is now present for resource packs
-   This directory contains JSON entries for configuring atlases:
    -   `blocks` - textures used by block and item models
    -   `banner_patterns`, `beds`, `chests`, `shield_patterns`, `shulker_boxes`, `signs` - used to render some special-case models
    -   `mob_effects` - textures used for effect icons in the UI
    -   `paintings` - textures used for paintings
    -   `particles` - textures used for particles (referenced by the `textures` field in files within the `particles` directory)
-   If multiple packs include those files, they are merged by their order within the pack (same as tags in data packs)
-   Inside these files is a JSON object with a single list called `sources`
    -   Every entry in `sources` runs in during load, in order of definition, adding or removing new files to the texture list; to be later referenced by block models, particles, etc
-   Types of sources:
    -   `directory` - lists all files in a directory and its subdirectories, across all namespaces
        -   `source` - directory in pack to be listed (relative to `textures` directory)
        -   `prefix` - string to be appended to the sprite name when loaded
    -   `single` - adds a single file
        -   `resource` - location of a resource within the pack (relative to `textures` directory, implied `.png` extension)
        -   `sprite` - sprite name (optional, defaults to `resource`)
    -   `filter` - removes sprites matching the given pattern
        -   `namespace`, `path` - patterns (regular expressions, regex) of ids to be removed (only works for entries already in the list)
            -   If omitted, any value will be matched
    -   `unstitch` - copies rectangular regions from other images
        -   `resource` - location of a resource within the pack (relative to `textures` directory, implied `.png` extension)
        -   `divisor_x`, `divisor_y` - used for determining the units used by regions
        -   `regions` - list of regions to copy from the source image
            -   `sprite` - sprite name
            -   `x`, `y` - coordinates of the top-left corner of the region
            -   `width`, `height` - size of the region
        -   Values such as `x` are transformed to real image coordinates via dividing by their divisor, and then multiplying by the real image size
-   Example: if a pack has a file named `assets/test/textures/fancy/iridium.png` and source is `{"type": "directory", "source": "fancy", "prefix": "custom/"}`, the texture will be available in models as `test:custom/iridium`

### Commands

-   New command: `fillbiome`
-   New execute sub-command: `execute if|unless biome`

#### `fillbiome`

Changes biome entries for an area. Note that biomes are not stored per-block, so affected positions may not match input precisely.

Syntax:

`fillbiome <from> <to> <biome>`

Parameters:

-   `from`: One corner of the area to fill
-   `to`: The other corner of the area to fill
-   `biome`: The biome to set

#### `execute`

Execute commands can now be conditional on biomes.

Syntax:

`execute if|unless biome <pos> <biome>`
