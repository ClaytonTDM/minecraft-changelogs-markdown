# Minecraft Snapshot 23w17a

Hello! Here is a new snapshot with tweaks to the new features, new advancements, new music and some long-awaited technical changes. For some time we've been working on a new faster light engine, and we are finally ready to share the result. Special thank you to the community for not only pointing out the issues with the game's light engine, but also to community members that have developed mods and plugins which have highlighted these performance challenges and served as an inspiration for our new implementation.

Please break it in all possible ways and report bugs!

## New Features

-   Added new advancements for Trails & Tales
-   Added new Trails & Tales ambient music
-   Added a new music disc obtainable through archaeology

### New advancements

#### Husbandry advancements

-   `Smells interesting` : Obtain a Sniffer Egg
-   `Little sniffs` : Feed a Snifflet (requires `Smells interesting`)
-   `Planting the past` : Plant any Sniffer seed (requires `Little sniffs`)

#### Adventure advancements

-   `Respecting the remnants` : Brush a Suspicious block to obtain a Pottery Sherd
-   `Careful restoration` : Make a Decorated Pot out of 4 Pottery Sherds (requires `Respecting the remnants`)
-   `Crafting a new look` : Craft a trimmed armor at a Smithing Table
-   `Smithing with style` : Apply these smithing templates at least once: Spire, Snout, Rib, Ward, Silence, Vex, Tide, Wayfinder (requires `Crafting a new look`)

### New ambient music

-   Added the following new music tracks by Aaron Cherof to Cherry Groves, Desert, Jungle, Badlands, and Flower Forest biomes
    -   A Familiar Room
    -   Bromeliad
    -   Crescent Dunes
    -   Echo in the Wind

### New music disc

-   Added a new music disc which can be found by brushing suspicious blocks in Trail Ruins
    -   When put in a Jukebox, Relic by Aaron Cherof is played

## Changes

-   Both types of Sculk Sensors now stay in their Cooldown phase for 10 ticks, with other phase timings being adjusted to compensate
-   Crafted Decorated Pots with at least one pattern now have a hover tooltip displaying the Sherd & Brick ingredients
-   Updated the credits
    -   Added the ability to scroll upwards by pressing the `up arrow` key

### Sculk Sensor Phases

-   Sculk Sensors and Calibrated Sculk Sensors have three phases: Inactive, Active and Cooldown
-   The default phase is Inactive
    -   This phase lasts indefinitely until the block receives a vibration
    -   During this phase, the block is able to listen to nearby vibrations until one has been scheduled
-   When a scheduled vibration is received, the block switches to the Active phase
    -   This phase lasts 30 game ticks for Sculk Sensors, and 10 game ticks for Calibrated Sculk Sensors
    -   During this phase, the block stops listening to nearby vibrations, wiggles its tendrils and emits a redstone signal and light
-   After the Active phase has finished, the block switches to a Cooldown phase
    -   This phase lasts for 10 game ticks
    -   During this phase, the block keeps wiggling its tendrils, but no longer emits a redstone signal nor light
    -   Finally, once this phase is finished, the block will switch back to the Inactive phase
-   Previously, some of these phases had different timing values:
    -   Active: 40 game ticks for Sculk Sensors and 20 game ticks for Calibrated Sculk Sensors
    -   Cooldown: 1 game tick for both types of Sculk Sensors
-   These phase timings were tweaked so that it is less common for activated contraptions to recursively activate the Sculk Sensor that powered them

## Technical Changes

-   The resource pack version is now 15, accounting for the font and credits update
    -   `legacy_unicode` glyph provider has been removed
    -   Bitmaps used by `uniform` font have been removed
    -   `uniform` font has been updated to use Unifont 15.0.01
        -   That changes shape of multiple characters, while also adding support for new ones
        -   Combining characters no longer include circle overlayed over them (so M◌̆ now renders as M ̆)
    -   Added second level of organization of entries in credits.json on top of `titles`, called `disciplines`
-   Font textures are included in debug texture dump (F3 + S)
-   Added new font glyph providers: `unihex` and `reference`, removed `legacy_unicode`
-   Improved performance of the light engine

### Fonts

#### New `unihex` glyph provider

-   New glyph provider for reading Unifont HEX files
    -   HEX format describes bitmap font glyphs
        -   height of every glyph is 16 pixels
        -   width of glyph can be 8, 16, 24 or 32 pixels
    -   every line is made of two hexadecimal numbers separated by `:`
    -   first value describes codepoint - it must have 4, 5 or 6 hex digits
    -   second value describes glyph as a stream of bits, line by line
-   When rendering, empty columns on left and right side of glyph are removed
    -   Custom glyph widths can be set with `size_overrides`
-   Provider requires two fields:
    -   `hex_file` - path to ZIP archive containing one or more `*.hex` files (files in archive with different extensions are ignored)
    -   `size_overrides` - list of codepoint ranges that should have width different that auto-detected (based on empty space in glyph). Fields:
        -   `from`, `to` - start and end of codepoint range (inclusive)
        -   `left`, `right` - integers describing position of left-most and right-most columns of glyph in range
            -   any bits in columns outside this range will be discarded

#### New `reference` glyph provider

-   New glyph provider can be used to include providers from other fonts
    -   Providers are guaranteed to be loaded only once, no matter how many times they are included
-   Provider has one field `id`, that describes other font to be included in currently loaded one
    -   Inclusion is performed after all fonts are loaded, so it will include all providers for a given font defined in all datapacks

#### Removed `legacy_unicode` glyph provider

-   `legacy_unicode` glyph provider has been removed
-   This functionality has been replaced by `unihex` provider

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w16a

In this weeks Snapshot we're bringing you tweaks to the Trail Ruins, new command functionality, a new advancement trigger, and more!

Happy mining!

Edit: We have published a fix for a crash issue in this Snapshot. If you are experiencing crashes, please try closing all instances of the game and restarting the Launcher.

## Changes

-   All Pottery Shards has been renamed to Pottery Sherds
-   If a vibration is scheduled to be received by a Sculk Sensor or Sculk Shrieker, they will stay queued until all adjacent chunks are loaded and ticking
    -   Prevents vibration resonance setups from breaking when unloading their chunks from a distance
-   The game's application icon has been updated
    -   This will be a Grass Block in release versions, and a Dirt Block in snapshot versions
-   Added native support for ARM64 machine architecture on Windows
    -   To try this out, you need to manually specify a native Java Executable in the launcher

### Sniffer

-   Sniffers can now be tempted by Torchflower seeds

### Trail Ruins

-   Reworked structures based on community feedback
-   Added more structure variants
-   Sand no longer generates within the structures
-   Tweaked the amount of gravel and dirt
-   Tweaked the amount of Suspicious Gravel
-   Split the loot tables for the Suspicious Gravel within the structure. There is now a dedicated loot table for Rare loot items (e.g. Pottery Sherds, Smithing Templates), and a dedicated loot table for more common loot drops (e.g. Stained Glass Pane, Tools, Candles, etc.)
-   Due to these changes you might see errors like `Failed to get element ResourceKey[minecraft:worldgen/processor_list / minecraft:trail_ruins_suspicious_sand]` in an old snapshot world. These are harmless, but existing Trail Ruin structures that was not previously fully loaded might be missing parts of the structure.

## Technical Changes

-   The data pack version is now 14, accounting for item display orientation changes
-   Added a `return` command
-   Added `recipe_crafted` advancement trigger

### Commands

#### `return`

The `return` command can be used to control execution flow inside functions and change their return value. Effects:

-   Remaining separate top-level commands in the currently executing function (if any) are skipped
-   The result value of the `function` command that triggered the function is changed from the number of commands executed to `value`
-   The result value of the `return` command is also `value`

Syntax:

`return <value>`

Parameters:

-   `value`: An integer return value

### Advancements

#### New triggers

##### `recipe_crafted`

-   Triggered when crafting a recipe
-   Conditions:
    -   `recipe_id` - the resource location of the recipe crafted
    -   `ingredients` - an array of predicates for the item stacks used in the recipe
        -   A single item stack can only be used to fulfill one predicate
        -   Each predicate needs to be fulfilled to trigger the advancement. This allows for seperation between recipes that have same identifier but use different ingredients.
        -   This field is optional. When not provided, or left empty, only the `recipe_id` will dictate the success of the trigger

### Tags

-   Added `villager_plantable_seeds` to represent which kind of seeds Villagers can farm
-   Added `maintains_farmland` to represent which blocks will not cause farmland to be converted into dirt when placed on top of it

### Display entity

#### Rendering changes

-   `item_display` items have been rotated 180 degrees around Y axis to better match transformation applied when rendering items on armor stand head and in item frames
    -   For reference, order of transformations applied to model (starting from innermost) is `item_transform`, rotate Y 180, `transformation` field, entity orientation (billboard option + `Rotation` field + `Pos` field)

# Minecraft Snapshot 23w14a

We are now releasing Snapshot 23w14a, containing changes to Sculk blocks and Enchanting Tables, a new Quick Play functionality, an updated logo for Java Edition, a new main menu panorama, and lots of bug fixes!

Happy mining!

## Changes

-   Changes to Sculk blocks
-   Replaceable blocks no longer block the connection between Enchanting Tables and Bookshelves
-   In the Desert Temple, the new room has more of its roof collapsed and one block of Suspicious Sand is always visible in the top layer
-   Updated the Minecraft: Java Edition logo
-   The main menu background is now a Trails & Tales panorama

### Sculk Shrieker

-   Waterlogging them will now silence their shriek sounds
-   Added to the Redstone Blocks tab in the creative menu

### Sculk Sensor

-   For both normal and calibrated Sculk Sensors, the following changes have been made:
    -   Default redstone output has been modified to be more reliable for distance calculations
    -   Now strongly powers the block they are placed on

### Calibrated Sculk Sensor

-   Has an active cooldown of 1 second instead of 2 seconds
-   Detects vibrations up to 16 blocks away instead of 8 blocks
-   Accepts signals into the calibration input side more consistently with other Redstone components
    -   For example, signals can now be received through a block

## Technical Changes

-   Signs with click commands can now be interacted with even if the Sign is not waxed
    -   Signs with non-`text` chat components can no longer be edited
-   Added new loot table function called `reference`
-   Added support for Quick Play
-   Removed the `server` & `port` arguments as their functionality has been replaced by Quick Play
-   Changes to tags
-   The resource pack version is now 14
    -   Updated the sprite layout of `minecraft.png`
    -   Removed the overriding `minecraft.png` from the Programmer Art resource pack
    -   Updated the sprite layout of `invite_icon.png`

### Loot tables

#### `reference`

New function `reference` allows functions to call sub-functions (similar to `reference` condition). Fields:

-   `name` - location of function to call

### Quick Play

-   Added support for four new command line arguments that allow the game to be launched directly into a world
-   `quickPlayPath` takes a specified path for logging (relative to the run directory)
    -   If a path is provided the following will be logged upon joining a world:
        -   `type`: is either `singleplayer`, `multiplayer`, or `realms`
        -   `identifier`: represents the world you want to join
            -   For singleplayer, the folder name of the world
            -   For multiplayer, the IP address of the server
            -   For realms, the Realms ID
        -   `port`: represents the server port and is only logged for multiplayer
        -   `name`: The name of the world
        -   `gamemode`: The gamemode of the world
        -   `lastPlayedTime`: The time you joined the world
    -   Example:
        -   `--quickPlayPath "quickPlay/log.json"` will resolve into `.minecraft/quickPlay/log.json`
-   `quickPlaySingleplayer`, `quickPlayMultiplayer` and `quickPlayRealms` all take their respective `identifier`
    -   If one of these arguments is provided, the game will try to launch directly into the given world
    -   Examples:
        -   `--quickPlaySingleplayer "New World"`
        -   `--quickPlayMultiplayer "localhost:25565"`
        -   `--quickPlayRealms "1234"`

### Tags

-   Added `replaceable_by_trees`, to better express blocks that are replaced when the tree grows through them
-   Removed `replaceable_plants` since it was only used as a subset of the blocks for the tag above, and not as universally
-   Added `sword_efficient`, to represent blocks that are broken slightly faster by a sword than normal
