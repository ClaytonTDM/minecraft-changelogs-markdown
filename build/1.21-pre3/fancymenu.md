# 1.21-pre3

The third pre-release for 1.21 is now available and it comes with even more bugfixes!

Additionally, we introduced some intentional but undocumented changes to the Wind Burst Enchantment in Pre-Release 1 last week. To remedy this, we're including those changes in this changelog instead.

Happy mining!

## Changes

### Wind Burst

-   Following changes were introduced in Pre-Release 1; The Wind Burst enchantment now bounces the player 7 blocks up per enchantment level
    -   With great power comes great responsibility - and risk! At level 3, the enchantment will bounce the player 21 blocks up which _doing some quick maths_ will hurt quite a bit when hitting the ground again
    -   In other words, make sure you have a target locked in (or other means of mitigating the fall damage) before making contact with the ground again

## Technical Changes

-   Data Pack version is now 48

## Data Pack Version 48

-   `replace_disc` entity effect type is renamed to `replace_disk`
