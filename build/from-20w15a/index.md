# Minecraft Snapshot 20w15a

It's a wonderful day here in Sweden today! The sun is shining and spring is in the air, and when I say "spring" I mean **pollen**. Let's remedy that by 1) Staying indoors and 2) Introduce an all new biome with a grain of basalt, blackstone, and magma cubes! To spice it up, we also have some new fine tunes for you to listen to while traversing the Nether. Enjoy the snapshot!

## New Features in 20w15a

-   Accessibility improvements
-   Added a piglin banner pattern
-   Added Basalt Deltas biome to the Nether
-   Added soul campfires. Warm your buns with the heat of one thousand souls!
-   Added three new tracks of Nether music
-   Added chiseled nether bricks, cracked nether bricks, and quartz bricks!
-   Added a new set of stone blocks called Blackstone with regular, polished, and polished brick variants!
-   Added Gilded Blackstone - Blackstone which has been imbued with gold and has a chance of dropping gold nuggets when broken
-   Blackstone can be used to craft furnaces and stone tools

### Accessibility

-   Added "Line Spacing" chat and accessibility option
-   Added "Chat Delay" accessibility option

### Basalt Deltas

Basalt Deltas can now be found in the Nether!

-   Remnants of volcanic eruptions, this biome sports a high concentration of Basalt columns and lava deltas
-   Walking through, you will be surrounded by flakes of flowing white ash
-   Magma Cubes finally have a place to call home, spawning very frequently
-   A new block, Blackstone, can be found in large patches here

### Nether Music

We're happy to announce that we've added three new tracks for the upcoming Nether Update, all composed by the very talented Lena Raine.

-   Rubedo will be played in the Nether Wastes
-   So Below will be played in Soul Sand Valleys and in Basalt Deltas
-   Chrysopoeia will be played in Crimson Forests

Some words from Lena:

-   "One of the primary instruments in Minecraft is the piano, and so one of my challenges to myself was to see how far I could push the sound of the piano until it resembled other things entirelyâ€“again, that alchemical process."
-   "I wanted each piece to feel like a progression of emotions, or a journey from place to place within this other world. There's a degree of beauty to the Nether, but it is also terrifying in both its details and scale."

Take a portal to the Nether, and stay awhile and listen...

Even though we just added [every update imaginable to Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/article/every-update-imaginable-coming-minecraft), we thought that it might be good to pick up the Nether Update snapshots from where we left off. This snapshot introduces the Zoglins!

## New Features in 20w14a

-   Hoglins that somehow end up in the Overworld become Zoglins fairly quickly - but who would ever bring a Hoglin to the Overworld?
-   Compasses can now be enchanted with Curse of Vanishing

â€‹

### Zoglins

â€‹

-   Zoglins are zombified hoglins - the result of bringing a hoglin into the overworld
-   Unlike hoglins they can't be bred or fed, and they don't care about warped fungus
-   Beware - these beasts are raving mad and attack just about everything they see!

## Changes in 20w14a

-   The main menu background is now in the Nether
-   The General statistics list is now alphabetically sorted
-   Strider balancing

### Strider Balancing

-   Strider speed while mounted has been significantly increased to more closely resemble boat speeds
-   Warped Fungus on a Stick now has 100 max item damage, and only takes 1 damage per Strider consume
-   When Warped Fungus on a Stick is used with Striders, the boost is a great way to traverse the lava seas

â€‹

## Technical Changes in 20w14a

-   The compass now has `LodestonePos`, `LodestoneDimension` and `LodestoneTracked` data fields. If `LodestoneTracked` is zero, the game will skip checking for a Lodestone in the specified position.
-   Attributes are now added to game registry, similar to items, sound events, etc.
-   Region files are now opened in synchronous mode to increase reliability

â€‹

### Attributes

Attributes have been moved to game registry. That means few changes: â€‹

-   Items and entities will no longer keep unknown attributes
-   Names of some attributes have been renamed to meet resource location requirements

#### Renames:
