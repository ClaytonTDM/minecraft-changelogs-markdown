# Minecraft 1.21.2 Pre-Release 1

## Experimental Features

### Winter Drop

#### Creaking mob

-   Creaking will not activate or freeze around players in Creative mode
-   Creaking summoned from the Creaking Heart cannot be named with a Nametag

#### Creaking Heart

-   Comparators attached to the Creaking Heart block will output a signal strength dependent on the distance to the connected Creaking

## Changes

-   Tweaked air bubbles UI
    -   Added an empty state for air bubbles along with a wobble when the player is drowning
    -   Added a popping sound when the bubbles pop in the UI

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 57
-   Resource Pack version is now 41

## Data Pack Version 57

-   Added `disablePlayerMovementCheck` game rule (default: false) that disables player movement speed restriction
    -   This behaves the same as the `disableElytraMovementCheck` rule, but applies irrespective of flying with Elytra

### Item Components

#### `minecraft:equippable`

-   Added field `camera_overlay` (optional): namespaced ID of the overlay texture to use when equipped
    -   If not specified, no overlay is used
    -   The ID will address a texture under the `textures/` folder and automatically assumed to be `.png`
        -   For instance, `misc/pumpkinblur` addresses `textures/misc/pumpkinblur.png`

### Particles

-   Format of color fields in particle options is now more standardized:
    -   RGB fields can always be encoded either as a vector of floats (order: `[R,G,B]`) or as a single packed integer (order: `RGB`)
    -   ARGB fields can always be encoded either as a vector of floats (order: `[R,G,B,A]` or as a single packed integer (order: `ARGB`)
    -   Changed fields:
        -   `minecraft:trail.color` (previously accepted only integer)
        -   `minecraft:dust.color` (previously accepted only vector of floats)
        -   `minecraft:dust_color_transition.from_color` (previously accepted only vector of floats)
        -   `minecraft:dust_color_transition.to_color` (previously accepted only vector of floats)

## Resource Pack Version 41
