# Minecraft Snapshot 24w11a

Oh look, it's a rare case of snapshot Thursday! This week we're expanding your arsenal with a smashing new weapon, the Mace! Use this weapon's special smash attack while leaping from a high place and watch your enemies get knocked back. The longer you fall, the harder you hit – but make sure you time it right! Your fall damage is only negated if you land the blow. Craft this new weapon by combining a Breeze Rod with the Heavy Core, a new item you can find by unlocking Trial Chamber Vaults.

As usual, we invite you to share your thoughts about this new feature over at the feedback site: [Let's talk about the Mace!](https://aka.ms/mcmacefeedback)

Alongside this hefty new mob swatter, we're also bringing you new chambers and variations to Trial Chambers, updated loot tables for Vaults, new Pottery Sherds, Armor Trims and Banner Patterns—as well as the usual slew of bug fixes and polish.

Happy mace-ing!

## Experimental Features

-   Added the Mace
-   Added Breeze Rod
-   Added Heavy Core
-   Added 2 new Armor Trims
-   Added 3 new Pottery Sherds
-   Added 2 new Banner Patterns
-   Updated Vault loot table
-   Updated Trial Chambers

## Blocks

### Heavy Core

-   A mysterious, dense block which can be combined with a Breeze Rod to craft a brand-new weapon: the Mace!

## Items

### Breeze Rod

-   An item dropped by the Breeze that can be crafted into 4 Wind Charges, or used with the Heavy Core to craft the Mace

### Mace

-   A new heavy weapon to smash your enemies!
-   Leverage the weight of this new weapon to deal additional damage the farther you fall before hitting your target
    -   Try it out by jumping down toward your target, and hit them before you hit the ground
    -   Successfully striking a target in this way will negate any damage accumulated from the fall, similar to how a Wind Charge works
    -   Other entities near the struck enemy will be knocked back by the immense force of the Mace
-   Using a Mace will decrease its durability like any other weapon; repair it with Breeze Rods at an anvil
-   Players can use a Mace in combination with Wind Charges to launch up and deliver devastating smash attacks on their enemies

## Mobs

### Breeze

-   Drops 1-2 Breeze Rods when killed by a player
    -   The number of Breeze Rods dropped is affected by looting enchantments

### Pottery Sherds

-   Added Flow, Guster, and Scrape Pottery Sherds

### Banner Patterns

-   Added Flow and Guster Banner Patterns

### Armor Trims

-   Added Bolt and Flow Armor Trims and Smithing Templates
-   Bolt can be duplicated using a Copper Block or Waxed Copper
-   Flow can be duplicated using a Breeze Rod

### Trial Chambers

-   Added new chambers and variations, with new challenges
    -   Remade chamber\_9, and renamed it to "slanted"
    -   Remade chamber\_3, and renamed it to "pedestal"
-   Added Flow, Guster, and Scrape Pottery Sherds to the Decorated Pots in the decor structure pool
-   Trial Spawners will now appear more frequently in the corridors
-   Changed the layout of the blocks around the Vaults
-   The loot tables of Vaults in Trial Chambers have been updated to address some inventory management issues
    -   You will now get no more than 1 unstackable item per Vault
    -   You will more often get rewards which can stack together
    -   Horse Armor and Saddles have been removed from the loot table
-   Vaults in Trial Chambers can now eject:
    -   Wind Charges
    -   Bolt Armor Trim Smithing Template
    -   Flow Armor Trim Smithing Template
    -   Flow Banner Pattern
    -   Guster Banner Pattern
    -   Heavy Core

## Changes

-   Adjusted flying behaviour for Bees and Parrot to keep them from overshooting their position when flying up and down
-   Status effect particle colors are no longer blended into one particle color
    -   All active visible status effect particles are now rendered separately
    -   The frequency of emitting status effect particles has been lowered to clutter the screen less
-   Updated the wolf armor crack textures
-   Menu background blur has been updated to look better and be more performant

### Wolf variants

When summon in other ways (e.g. using the Spawn Egg or using the `summon` command), the variant selection follows the natural spawning biome rules with the following extensions:

-   Rusty Wolf: will be selected in all Jungle biomes, including Jungle and Bamboo Jungle Biomes
-   Spotted Wolf: will be selected in all Savanna biomes, including Savanna and Windswept Savanna Biomes
-   Striped Wolf: will be selected in all Badlands biomes, including Badlands and Eroded Badlands Biomes

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 35
-   The Resource Pack version is now 29

## Data Pack Version 35

-   Removed `any` entity sub-predicate
-   Component-specific item predicate properties have been moved to separate field `predicates`
-   Added slot name `contents` for single-slot entities like item frames and item displays
-   Contents of `item` entity can now be accessed through `contents` slot name
-   Added new loot functions

### Predicates

#### Item sub-predicate

-   Some fields from item predicate have been moved to a map in an optional field `predicates`
-   The new field is similar to the `components` field on item stacks
-   This was done to simplify addition for future predicates and to allow sub-predicates to more closely resemble names of components they match
-   The following fields have been moved:
    -   `enchantments` - field moved to sub-predicate `minecraft:enchantments`
    -   `stored_enchantments` - field moved to sub-predicate `minecraft:stored_enchantments`
    -   `potions` - field moved to sub-predicate `minecraft:potion_contents`
    -   `custom_data` - field moved to sub-predicate `minecraft:custom_data`
-   `durability` field has been expanded to `minecraft:damage` predicate:
    -   This check now works for any item that has `minecraft:damage` component
    -   An item that does not have a `minecraft:damage` component can never match
    -   To check for unbreakable items, query value of `minecraft:unbreakable` component
    -   Fields:
        -   `damage` - optional bounds for value of `minecraft:damage` component
        -   `durability` - optional bounds for durability (max damage minus value of `minecraft:damage`)
-   Predicates `minecraft:enchantments`, `minecraft:stored_enchantments`, `minecraft:potion_contents` and `minecraft:damage` require matching component to exist on item
    -   That means that, for example, matching for empty enchantment list will not pass on items without `minecraft:damage` component
    -   Note: some components, like `minecraft:enchantments` have default values, so they will always match

##### Example:

Before:

    "item": {
      "enchantments": [
        {
          "enchantment": "minecraft:silk_touch",
          "levels": {
            "min": 1
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    

After:

    "item": {
      "predicates": {
        "minecraft:enchantments": [
            {
              "enchantment": "minecraft:silk_touch",
              "levels": {
                "min": 1
              }
            }
          ]
      }
    }
