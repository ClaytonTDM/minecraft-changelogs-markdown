# Minecraft 1.16.4 Pre-Release 2

Time for another pre-release! This time around we've fixed some issues with the new social interactions screen and we've also fixed some crashes.

In case you haven't heard, yesterday we announced that Mojang accounts will be migrating into Microsoft accounts. With this pre-release, we are preparing for that by having the game understand the settings and block-list of Microsoft accounts. You can read more about that over [here](https://www.minecraft.net/article/java-edition-moving-house), and you can find answers to questions you might have in the [FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/articles/360050865492). The FAQ will be continuously updated.

We aim to release 1.16.4 sometime during next week.

## Changes in 1.16.4 Pre-release 2

-   Players blocked in your Microsoft account are now also blocked in the game
-   A button to open a link to the Accessibility Guide can now be found in the Accessibility Options screen

# Minecraft 1.16.4 Pre-Release 1

The first pre-release for 1.16.4 is officially out! ​ If you’ve been on the Internet for some time, you’ve probably noticed that you occasionally run into other players that you don’t get along with. To alleviate some of that frustration, we’re introducing a UI element called the “social interactions screen”, which will let you disable chatting with certain players, thus hiding any messages you receive from them. Additionally, the 1.16.4 update will contain some fixes for critical bugs, but other than that, this will be it for this dot-release. ​ Please help us out by testing the new UI and reporting any bugs you find on the [Minecraft Issue Tracker](https://aka.ms/snapshotbugs?ref=launcher). ​

## New Features in 1.16.4 Pre-release 1

​

-   New UI called Social Interactions Screen

​

## Technical Changes in 1.16.4 Pre-release 1

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w30a

Today we're releasing Snapshot 20w30a for Minecraft Java Edition in which we've tweaked Bastion Remnants, and given you the ability to have lanterns under water.

## Changes in 20w30a

-   Modified how respawn positions are chosen for beds and respawn anchors
-   Lanterns can now be waterlogged
-   Soul Lanterns can now be waterlogged
-   Tweaked the Bastion Remnant chest loot
-   Chests in Bastion Remnants are now more likely to be located on top of gilded blackstone

### Respawn Block Positions

-   Respawn anchors will prioritize cardinal directions over corners
-   Beds will prioritize the side of the bed the player entered from and then spaces circling around the foot of the bed up to the head of the bed
-   Respawning players will now face the block that they respawned at
-   Placing players onto dangerous blocks is now avoided when possible

## Technical Changes in 20w30a

-   The sign edit screen will now intialize from existing sign text (should have no noticeable impact on vanilla)
-   Tags can now have optional entries

### Optional Tag Entries

Entries in tags can now be marked as optional. Failure to resolve optional entries does not prevent the whole tag from loading.

Example:

    {
      "replace": false,
      "values": [
        "#minecraft:beds", // existing syntax
        { "id":"#missing:tag", "required": false }, // optional sub-tag entry
    "minecraft:anvil", // existing syntax
    { "id":"minecraft:stone_button", "required": true }, // new syntax for required tags
    { "id":"missing:block", "required": false } // optional single-element entry

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w28a

This week's snapshot introduces experimental support for custom biomes in data packs. This work has involved redoing some of the internal plumbing of things behind the scene, so it might be a bit leaky. We hope no important parts drip out, but if they do, pick them back up for us, please.

As always, make sure to make backups if you try a world in a snapshot.

## Changes in 20w28a

​

-   Villagers now emit green particles when joining a village, setting a home bed, or acquiring a job site/profession
-   Brewing stands can now be crafted with blackstone
-   Tweaked bartering loot
-   Totems of undying now give the fire resistance status affect for 40 seconds when activated

​

## Technical Changes in 20w28a

​

-   Custom worlds now support custom biomes
-   Dedicated servers can now rate limit clients

​

### Customized world generation

​

-   There is now experimental support for a `worldgen` folder in data packs
-   `worldgen/biome` can contain biome definitions
-   `worldgen/configured_carver` can contain definitions for world carver settings
-   `worldgen/configured_feature` can contain definitions for feature placements
-   `worldgen/configured_structure_feature` can contain definitions for structure placements
-   `worldgen/configured_surface_builder` can contain definitions for surfaces
-   `worldgen/processor_list` can contain sets of block processors
-   `worldgen/template_pool` can contain pool definitions for jigsaw structures
-   Custom biomes can now be used in the single biome/caves/floating islands world types (add the data pack containing the biome first)
-   Custom biomes can now be used in custom dimension generators

​

### Dedicated server packet limit

​

-   Dedicated servers can now kick clients that consistently send too many packets within a second
-   Controlled with the `rate-limit` settings in `server.properties`
-   The default rate limit of 0 means "no limit"

​

# Minecraft 1.16 Release Candidate

Out with the old, and in with the new! Today we're introducing a new naming convention (well, it's been a while) for Minecraft Java Edition. Previously, the last pre-release was, in fact, the release candidate, but we're now making that more clear by changing the name to be "release candidate". This means that if there are no major issues following this release, no further changes will be done before the full release.

Speaking of the full release: In case you've been living under a rock (it's Minecraft, so that's OK), [we're releasing the Nether Update on Tuesday, June 23](https://www.minecraft.net/article/the-nether-update-has-date-). That's next week!

## Fixed Bugs in 1.16 Release Candidate 1

-   You can now milk Cows and Mooshrooms in creative mode
-   You can now get stew from Mooshrooms in creative mode

-   When any villager is struck by lightning, the witch it is converted to will no longer despawn
-   Added gamerule universalAnger (disabled by default), which makes angered neutral mobs attack any nearby player, not just the player that angered them. Works best if you disable forgiveDeadPlayers.
-   Added gamerule forgiveDeadPlayers (enabled by default), which makes angered neutral mobs stop being angry when the targeted player dies nearby.
-   Zombified piglins no longer attack innocent bystanders (unless you enable gamerule universalAnger)
-   Zombified piglins stop being angry if the targeted player dies nearby (unless you disable gamerule forgiveDeadPlayers)

## Technical Changes in 1.16 Pre-release 1

### Pack Selection Screen

-   Packs can now be dropped directly on data and resource pack selection screens
-   Dropped files and directories will be copied to appropriate places

### Smithing Recipes

There's now a `smithing` recipe type. Recipes of this type are used in the smithing table to upgrade one item type into another type, maintaining tags.

-   `base` - Ingredient specifying an item to be upgraded.
-   `addition` - Ingredient specifying valid items to trigger the upgrade.
-   `result` - Item specifying the resulting type of the upgraded item.

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w22a

It has been a busy week for us but we still wanted to squeeze out a snapshot as we've been busy squashing a bunch of bugs.

## Experimental Rendering Changes

We've included some experimental changes to graphics rendering in this snapshot, which might reveal some issues on a small number of older graphics cards.

If do you find any new graphical bugs then please report them to the bug tracker with the make and model of your graphics card as well as which operating system you are using ​

## New Features in 20w22a

​

-   Piglins now sometimes dance in celebration of a completed hunt

​

## Changes in 20w22a

​

-   Villager workstation logic changes
-   Bells can be hung from the underside of more blocks
-   When a villager that was traded with is struck by lightning, the witch it is converted to will no longer despawn
-   Players can no longer mount another entity when the crouch key is held down

​

### Villager Workstation Logic

​

-   Villagers no longer try to work at the same workstation
-   The most experienced nearby villager for the profession corresponding to the workstation you add will get the workstation
-   Villagers now have to walk to and reach the workstation before they can acquire the profession / work there
-   Villagers can no longer claim workstations / professions during raids or night time.
-   Villagers will check and make sure their workstation is valid at all times of day as long as they are within 16 blocks of their workstation.

​

## Technical Changes in 20w22a

​

-   Slightly changed datapack loading to prevent custom datapacks from crashing
-   Cached repeated block type lookups and collisions during pathfinding for increased performance
-   Minor optimizations in collision detection
-   Top level element in predicate file can now be array (all contents will be ANDed)
-   Added shader support for accessing depth buffer.
-   Renderer now uses per-pixel blending layers for some transparent elements.

​

### Datapack loading

​

-   If datapack reload fails, changes will not be applied and game will continue using previous data
-   If existing datapacks prevent world from loading, game will give option to load world in safe mode, which loads only vanilla datapack
-   Changes to datapack list are stored only after successful reload
-   Added `--safeMode` option to server to load only with vanilla datapack
-   Game will now detect critical datapack issues, like missing required tags and prevent world from being loaded

​

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w21a

In this snapshot, we're adding support for custom world settings and custom dimensions. This is an early release to hear your feedback about this feature - do note that this support is considered experimental and unsupported. Any custom world settings may change from one snapshot to the next, and worlds using custom settings will be clearly marked as experimental in your worlds list. ​

## New Features in 20w21a

​

-   Added the ability to toggle redstone wire between a cross and a dot
-   Added import/export world settings functionality
-   Added a new disableMultiplayer command line option - when used, the Multiplayer button is disabled
-   Added a new disableChat command line option - when used, receiving and sending online chat is disabled

​

### Redstone Toggle

​

-   When right clicking a single piece of redstone, it toggles between a the cross and the dot
-   A dot of redstone will not power its surrounding blocks

​

## Changes in 20w21a

​

-   Piglins no longer walk around when admiring gold
-   If you hurt a piglin while it is admiring an ingot, the ingot will now disappear
-   Increased the chance of ores to generate in the Basalt Deltas to balance against the reduced amount of Netherrack in this biome
-   Lily pads are now considered junk fishing loot rather than treasure
-   Updated logos for Mojang Studios and Minecraft
-   Temporarily removed structure settings from flat level preset strings (workaround: use import/export settings functionality)

​

## Technical Changes in 20w21a

​

-   Added the ability to control the height of the `spreadplayers` command
-   Added custom worlds and custom dimensions

​

### Commands

​

#### `spreadplayers`

​ Added an optional argument to specify maximum height. New syntax: `spreadplayers <center> <spreadDistance> <maxRange> [under <maxHeight>] <respectTeams> <targets>` ​

-   `maxHeight` - Specifies the maximum height for resulting positions

​

#### `locate`

​

-   Structure names are now specified as lowercase

​

### Custom Worlds

​

-   Added experimental support for new custom worlds
-   Edit world screen now has an option to export world settings to a JSON file
-   During world creation you can import previously exported world settings
-   A bunch of new parameters are exposed, but marked as experimental, meaning you can play with them, but there is no guarantee that any of them will continue working (even in the next snapshot!)
-   Flat level preset string lost structure settings (they are now stored in a common format for all worlds), we will restore some form of this functionality soon
-   Buffet world can no longer be created from server.properties, flat level settings changed a bit; better support for custom world creation on the server is coming soon

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w20b

-   Your last game mode is remembered and will be the first selected option, so you can quickly toggle between two game modes with a single press of F3 + F4!

​

#### F3 + N (Toggle Spectator)

A small change has been made to this debug combination. ​

-   By default, using this key would return to Creative after toggling from Spectator. It now will toggle back to the previous game mode you had.

-   Obtaining Blackstone now also counts for the `Stone Age` advancement
-   Breeding Striders now counts for `The Parrots and the Bats` and is now required for `Two by Two`

​

## Technical Changes in 20w20a

-   Shulkers with "NoAI" can now be summoned with rotation.
-   Added `thrown_item_picked_up_by_entity` advancement trigger
-   Added `player_generates_container_loot` advancement trigger
-   Added `item_used_on_block` advancement trigger
-   Removed `safely_harvest_honey` advancement trigger

​

### Advancements

#### `item_used_on_block` trigger type

Properties:

-   `item` matches the thrown item which was picked up
-   `entity` matches the entity which picked up the item

​

#### `player_generates_container_loot` trigger type

Properties:

​

#### `item_used_on_block` trigger type

Properties:

-   `location` matches the location at the center of the block the item was used on

​

### Miscellaneous trigger changes

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w18a

In this snapshot we made some changes to Redstone wire and we fixed a bunch of bugs.

## Changes in 20w18a

-   Redstone wire changes
-   The target block now conducts redstone signals

​

### Redstone wire

The blockstate, rendering and behavior of redstonewire are more in line with each other. Redstone will provide power to blocks on all sides it shows a visual connection to, and not do so on those sides without a visual connection. ​

-   A single redstone wire is now represented as a cross.
-   A wire on top of a block, which is redirected from below, will power the sides it is redirected to now. E.g. a fence gate above the redirecting wire will be powered.
-   Wires that redirect upwards to wires on non-conductive blocks used to only be redirected visually. Now this redirection applies to their behavior as well.
-   A wire that is redirected to go over a block will now always provide power to the block. This is most noticeable when the wire has signal strength 1.

​![Comparison between 1.15.2 and snapshot 20w18a](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/images/RedstoneChanges3_741x421.png)

## Technical Changes in 20w18a

-   Added a `enable-status` option to the server.properties file which if set to `false` will suppress replies to status requests from clients. This makes the server appear offline in the multiplayer screen.
-   Added control over how much entity data a server sends to clients
-   Advancement system changes

​

### Entity Broadcasting

It is now possible to control at what range the server sends data about entities to clients. ​

-   Added an `entity-broadcast-range-percentage` server property controlling how close entities need to be before being sent to clients. Higher values means entities are visible further away from players but cause more network traffic. Specifies percentage of default value, so for example `50` specifies half of the default range.

​

### Advancements

-   Added `player` check to every trigger (except `impossible`)
-   Entity checks in triggers can now use loot table condition syntax

​

#### Extended entity checks

Entity checks in triggers can now use loot table condition syntax. Old notation:

    {
      "trigger": "minecraft:player_killed_entity",
      "conditions": {
        "entity": {
          "type": "minecraft:blaze"
        }
      }
    }
    

is now equivalent to:

    {
      "trigger": "minecraft:player_killed_entity",
      "conditions": {
        "entity": [
          {
            "condition": "minecraft:entity_properties",
            "predicate": {
              "type": "minecraft:blaze"
            },
            "entity": "this"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    

**Note 1**: Like in loot tables, all conditions in top level array must be met for whole condition to trigger. ​ **Note 2**: To access new functionality, top level element must be JSON array. JSON object are interpreted as old notation.  
​ Full list of extended triggers:

-   New field `player` in every trigger
-   `bred_animals` - `parent`, `partner`, `child`
-   `channeled_lightning` - `victims`
-   `cured_zombie_villager` - `zombie`, `villager`
-   `fishing_rod_hooked` - `entity`
-   `killed_by_crossbow` - `victims`
-   `player_killed_entity` - `entity`
-   `entity_killed_player` - `entity`
-   `player_hurt_entity` - `entity`
-   `summoned_entity` - `entity`
-   `tame_animal` - `entity`
-   `target_hit` - `projectile`
-   `villager_trade` - `villager`

​

#### Miscellaneous trigger changes

-   Due to addition of `player`, existing contents of `location`, `slept_in_bed`, `hero_of_the_village`, `voluntary_exile` can now be placed in `location` field instead of top-level object. Old syntax is still supported, but depreciated.

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w17a

This week's snapshot brings you some tweaks, bugfixes, and technical changes!

We also have a survey up so that you can tell us what you think about the Nether Update. You can find it by clicking [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SF65G2F). We would very much appreciate if you could take the time and fill it out.

## New Features in 20w17a

-   Added an Entity Distance scale option ranging from 50% to 500%
-   Difficulty and game rules can now be changed from "Create World" screen

## Changes in 20w17a

-   Improved Smithing Table UI
-   Ruined portals now spawn less frequently
-   Renamed "Soul Fire Torch" and "Soul Fire Lantern" to "Soul Torch" and "Soul Lantern"
-   Tweaked Bastion Remnant loot
-   Walls now create posts under more things, like pressure plates and banners
-   The "Singleplayer" button will jump directly to "Create World" screen if there are no worlds to select

## Technical Changes in 20w17a

-   Block storage format in chunks slightly changed to speed up various tasks (rendering, pathfinding, world generation, etc).
-   Chat component style can now select font.
-   Full range of Unicode characters is supported (some may know what that means 😉)
-   Added the `attribute` command

### World save format

-   Saving `level.dat` now uses randomly-named temporary files (instead of using `level.dat_new` every time)
-   `player/*.dat` are now saved in a way similar to `level.dat` (including leaving `.dat_old` files)

### Block storage

`BlockStates` in `Sections` elements no longer contain values stretching over multiple 64-bit fields. If number of bits per block is not power of two (i.e. single 64-bit value can't fill whole number of blockstates) some bits will not be used. For example, if single block state takes 5 bits, highest 4 bits of every 64-bit field will be unused. That also means slight increase in storage size (in case of 5 bits, from 320 to 342 64-bit fields).

### Commands

#### `attribute`

Adds modifies attribute on single entity. Possible syntax: Parameters:

-   `attribute <target> <attribute> get [<scale>]` - get total value of attribute
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> base set <value>` - sets base valye
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> base get [<scale>]` - get base value
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> modifier add <uuid> <name> <value> add|multiply|multiply_base` - adds modifier (fails if modifier is already present)
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> modifier remove <uuid>` - removes modifier
-   `attribute <target> <attribute> modifier value get <uuid> [<scale>]` - get value of modifier
-   `target` - single entity (note: only players, armor stands and mobs have attributes)
-   `attribute` - name of attribute (like `minecraft:generic.max_health`)
-   `name` - string (in optional quotes) describing human-readable name of modifier
-   `value` - floating point value (note: certain attributes have limits on final value, so your change might not be noticeable)

### Chat components

#### Hover event argument

-   `style.hoverEvent` parameter now has parameter `contents`, with contents depending on type:
    -   For `show_text` - chat component
    -   For `show_item` - either item id or object with fields `id`, `count` and `tag` (with last one being serialized NBT)
    -   For `show_entity` - object with fields: `id` (UUID), `name` (chat component) and `type` (entity type resource location)
-   Old style `value` argument is now deprecated (but still supported)

#### Colors

`color` property can now contain RGB value prefixed by `#`. For example `#55ff55` will result in the same color as `green`.

#### Custom fonts

Chat component style now supports `font` property, which is resource location for font in resource pack. No entry is equivalent to `minecraft:default`.

### Fonts

-   `Force Unicode` option now switches between normal and alternative font (called `uniform.json`) - no reload needed

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w16a

Bastion remnants, or "home sweet home" as Piglins would call them, are finally here! This snapshot introduces the home of the Piglins. If you scour the world you might also find ruins of some old portals.

## New Features in 20w16a

-   Added Bastion Remnants!
-   Added Ruined Portals
-   Added chain blocks
-   Added a new music disc titled "Pigstep" by Lena Raine which can only be found in Bastions Remnants

### Bastion Remnants

What's made of Blackstone and full of piglins and hoglins? Bastion Remnants!

-   Added 4 separate Bastion Remnant types: Bridge, Hoglin Stable, Housing Units, and Treasure Room
-   You can find these sizable structures in all biomes in the Nether except the treacherous ash-dusted towers of Basalt Deltas
-   Explore, loot, and conquer a Bastion Remnant to call it your home...but beware, Piglins don't take kindly to intruders stealing their things

### Ruined Portals

Shattered remains of ancient nether portals. Wonder who built them?

-   They can be found in any overworld or nether biome
-   Some are hidden underground, under the sea, or buried in sand

## Changes in 20w16a

-   The piglin banner pattern can now be found in Bastion Remnants
-   Increased the amount of lava pools to make the deltas more "deltary"

## Technical Changes in 20w16a

-   Added a button in the GUI that generates a jigsaw structure starting from the jigsaw block, using given generation depth.
-   Expanded the max size per axis of Structure Blocks from 32 to 48
-   Added a JMX MBean to monitor dedicated server tick times

### JMX Monitoring

It is now possible to monitor the server tick times though JMX. The rationale for this is that JMX is a well known and supported monitoring technology with existing integrations and tools.

This enables server admins to hook alerts and graphing tools using ordinary JMX clients and dashboards.

#### Enabling JMX Monitoring

-   A new flag `enable-jmx-monitoring` has been added to the server.properties file which if set to `true` will expose an MBean with the Object name `net.minecraft.server:type=Server` and two attributes `averageTickTime` and `tickTimes` exposing the tick times in milliseconds.
-   In order for enabling JMX on the Java runtime you also need to add a couple of JVM flags to the startup as documented [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html).

## Fixed bugs in 20w16a

-   [MC-37557](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-37557) Sometimes a minecart sound plays/subtitle shown when loading a world
-   [MC-91163](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-91163) Certain subtitles show up when the player is too far away to hear the sound

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w15a

It's a wonderful day here in Sweden today! The sun is shining and spring is in the air, and when I say "spring" I mean **pollen**. Let's remedy that by 1) Staying indoors and 2) Introduce an all new biome with a grain of basalt, blackstone, and magma cubes! To spice it up, we also have some new fine tunes for you to listen to while traversing the Nether. Enjoy the snapshot!

## New Features in 20w15a

-   Accessibility improvements
-   Added a piglin banner pattern
-   Added Basalt Deltas biome to the Nether
-   Added soul campfires. Warm your buns with the heat of one thousand souls!
-   Added three new tracks of Nether music
-   Added chiseled nether bricks, cracked nether bricks, and quartz bricks!
-   Added a new set of stone blocks called Blackstone with regular, polished, and polished brick variants!
-   Added Gilded Blackstone - Blackstone which has been imbued with gold and has a chance of dropping gold nuggets when broken
-   Blackstone can be used to craft furnaces and stone tools

### Accessibility

-   Added "Line Spacing" chat and accessibility option
-   Added "Chat Delay" accessibility option

### Basalt Deltas

Basalt Deltas can now be found in the Nether!

-   Remnants of volcanic eruptions, this biome sports a high concentration of Basalt columns and lava deltas
-   Walking through, you will be surrounded by flakes of flowing white ash
-   Magma Cubes finally have a place to call home, spawning very frequently
-   A new block, Blackstone, can be found in large patches here

### Nether Music

We're happy to announce that we've added three new tracks for the upcoming Nether Update, all composed by the very talented Lena Raine.

-   Rubedo will be played in the Nether Wastes
-   So Below will be played in Soul Sand Valleys and in Basalt Deltas
-   Chrysopoeia will be played in Crimson Forests

Some words from Lena:

-   "One of the primary instruments in Minecraft is the piano, and so one of my challenges to myself was to see how far I could push the sound of the piano until it resembled other things entirely–again, that alchemical process."
-   "I wanted each piece to feel like a progression of emotions, or a journey from place to place within this other world. There's a degree of beauty to the Nether, but it is also terrifying in both its details and scale."

Take a portal to the Nether, and stay awhile and listen...

## Changes in 20w15a

-   Dispenser changes
-   Soul sand can now be used to craft soul torches

-   Mobs now avoid walking on magma blocks and lit campfires

-   Dispensers can now put carpets on llamas
-   Dispensers can now put chests on llamas, donkeys and mules
-   Dispensers can now shear a Mooshroom

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w14a

Even though we just added [every update imaginable to Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/article/every-update-imaginable-coming-minecraft), we thought that it might be good to pick up the Nether Update snapshots from where we left off. This snapshot introduces the Zoglins!

## New Features in 20w14a

-   Hoglins that somehow end up in the Overworld become Zoglins fairly quickly - but who would ever bring a Hoglin to the Overworld?
-   Compasses can now be enchanted with Curse of Vanishing

​

### Zoglins

​

-   Zoglins are zombified hoglins - the result of bringing a hoglin into the overworld
-   Unlike hoglins they can't be bred or fed, and they don't care about warped fungus
-   Beware - these beasts are raving mad and attack just about everything they see!

## Changes in 20w14a

-   The main menu background is now in the Nether
-   The General statistics list is now alphabetically sorted
-   Strider balancing

### Strider Balancing

-   Strider speed while mounted has been significantly increased to more closely resemble boat speeds
-   Warped Fungus on a Stick now has 100 max item damage, and only takes 1 damage per Strider consume
-   When Warped Fungus on a Stick is used with Striders, the boost is a great way to traverse the lava seas

​

## Technical Changes in 20w14a

-   The compass now has `LodestonePos`, `LodestoneDimension` and `LodestoneTracked` data fields. If `LodestoneTracked` is zero, the game will skip checking for a Lodestone in the specified position.
-   Attributes are now added to game registry, similar to items, sound events, etc.
-   Region files are now opened in synchronous mode to increase reliability

​

### Attributes

Attributes have been moved to game registry. That means few changes: ​

-   Items and entities will no longer keep unknown attributes
-   Names of some attributes have been renamed to meet resource location requirements

#### Renames:

-   `generic.maxHealth` 🡆 `generic.max_health`
-   `zombie.spawnReinforcements` 🡆 `zombie.spawn_reinforcements`
-   `horse.jumpStrength` 🡆 `horse.jump_strength`
-   `generic.followRange` 🡆 `generic.follow_range`
-   `generic.knockbackResistance` 🡆 `generic.knockback_resistance`
-   `generic.movementSpeed` 🡆 `generic.movement_speed`
-   `generic.flyingSpeed` 🡆 `generic.flying_speed`
-   `generic.attackDamage` 🡆 `generic.attack_damage`
-   `generic.attackKnockback` 🡆 `generic.attack_knockback`
-   `generic.attackSpeed` 🡆 `generic.attack_speed`
-   `generic.armorToughness` 🡆 `generic.armor_toughness`

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w11a

In this snapshot you can be on your merry way across the beautiful Soulsand Valleys with your freshly enchanted boots. It's a bit scary to be fair, so these boots will help you out with that bit...

## Before we dive into this snapshot, a word about Redstone

Redstone is one of the coolest things in Minecraft and many of you are members of communities that focus on building mind-blowing redstone contraptions, farms, computing machines and 256x256 piston doors.

A lot of redstone behaviour is currently categorized as “undefined”. This is when the behaviour of the block is not the result of intentional code but is a side-effect of unaccounted edge cases or quirks in the game code.​

We know that many players consider undefined behaviour as a very interesting aspect of redstone and enjoy experimenting with and using undefined behaviour to build unique contraptions to share with the rest of the community.​

However, the quirks of undefined behaviour can be quite surprising - even when building simple contraptions. This quirkiness can be a negative experience for players new to redstone and may turn them away from this very unique and exciting aspect of Minecraft as well as the vast redstone community behind it.​

Our goal is to bring all redstone components up to a level of quality that we are happy with and we will be making adjustments where it makes the most sense for redstone going forward.

Any changes we make will be communicated in the snapshot changelogs and as always we will be reading your feedback and comments.

## New Features in 20w11a

-   Added Soul Speed enchantment
-   Added Twisting Vines that grow upwards
-   Nether gold ore can now be found in the nether - it is just like gold ore, but more Nether-y

### Soul Speed

Never suffer again drudging through Soul Sand Valleys - Soul Speed has you covered!

-   Shine your boots of choice with this soul-sucking enchantment to speed around on Soul Sand and Soul Soil!
-   There's a downside, however: enchantments will slowly degrade your boots each Soul block you walk on
-   Can only be obtained by bartering with those pesky Piglins

## Changes in 20w11a

-   Bell blocks will now ring when hit by any projectile
-   TNT and Campfires will now ignite when hit by any burning projectile
-   Bone meal can now be used to grow kelp, weeping vines and twisting vines
-   Hoes are now the appropriate tools for mining Hay, Targets, Dried Kelp Blocks, Shroomlights, Nether Wart Blocks and Warped Wart Blocks
-   Doors, rails, buttons, pressure plates, redstone and more can now be placed on soulsand and full-block of snow layers
-   Soul sand with a rail on top will no longer slow-down minecarts

## Technical Changes in 20w11a

-   `minecraft:soul_speed_blocks` is any block that the Soul Speed enchantment increases speed on
-   New particle type: `soul`

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w09a

Today is a sad day for Obsidian... It's crying. If you're not into crying you could always take aim at the new Target that we've added.

This update can also be found on [minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-20w09a).

If you find any bugs, please report them on the official [Minecraft Issue Tracker](https://aka.ms/snapshotbugs?ref=reddit).

## New Features in 20w09a

-   Added the Target Block!
-   Added new Crying Obsidian block! It's sad and it cries purple energy

### Target Block

Because let’s face it, your aim could use some practice

-   The closer you hit to the center, the larger the redstone signal!
-   Test your skills with a variety of projectiles, including eggs, snowballs, tridents, and more!
-   You will need one hay block and four redstone for this recipe

### Zombified Piglin

-   Zombie Pigmen are now known as Zombified Piglins, and they now have ears... or well, one at least

## Changes in 20w09a

-   Bartering loot has been restructured to be more appealing to Survival players
-   Crying Obsidian can now be obtained from Piglin Bartering
-   Entities now get pushed by flowing lava

-   Can now place Warped/Crimson roots and fungi into pots
-   Nether wart blocks and warped wart block can be cleared quickly using a hoe
-   Weeping vines are now climbable!
-   Biome fog color smoothly blends between biomes. Smooth
-   Changed ambient block lighting in the Nether to be on parity with other editions

### Block Renames

Some blocks have been renamed. Turns out singular Fungus in the Nether attempted to falsely present itself as many Fungi - very sneaky!

-   Crimson Fungi is now called Crimson Fungus
-   Warped Fungi is now called Warped Fungus

## Technical Changes in 20w09a

-   New particle types: `dripping_obsidian_tear`, `falling_obsidian_tear`, `landing_obsidian_tear`
-   Piglins now have an `IsImmuneToZombification` data value that prevents them from zombifying in the overworld

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w08a

A wild snapshot appears! To tell you the truth, we hadn't actually planned to do a snapshot this week, but the Villagers were in dire need of neurosurgery.

## Fixed bug in 20w08a

-   [MC-172078](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-172078) All villagers with saved memory disappear when upgrading to 20w07a

---

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w07a

Ahh, a freshly baked snapshot! It undoubtedly smells better than the piglins that we just added...

## Features in 20w07a

-   Endermen can now pick up some of the new Nether blocks
-   Endermen will no longer pick up Netherrack
-   Gave Hoglins some actual functionality
-   Added Piglins
-   Netherite blocks can be used as the base of a beacon and Netherite ingots can be used as the fuel for a beacon. Weird flex but ok.

### Advancements

-   Piglins and hoglins are now required for Monster Hunter and Monsters Hunted

### Hoglins

-   Hoglins are big aggressive beasts that live in crimson forests in the nether
-   They attack players on sight, so be careful, they can easily knock you off a ledge!
-   Hoglins drop pork and sometimes leather, but not willingly
-   You can breed hoglins by feeding them crimson fungi, but do so at your own risk
-   Hoglins get hunted by piglins sometimes, but they don't go down without a fight!
-   Despite this, hoglins and piglin aren't enemies - they are more like an ecosystem
-   Baby hoglins like to pretend they are tough - but don't worry, they are more like angry puppies with no teeth
-   Want to keep hoglins off your back? Pro tip: Hoglins hate the smell of warped fungi!

### Piglins

-   Piglins are an aggressive civilization that live in the nether
-   They mostly hang around in the crimson forest, but you might find some in the nether wastes too
-   They think of players as target practice and will attack on sight
-   However if you dress appropriately they will see you as a respectable figure, or tolerable at least
-   Piglins are suspicious of strangers and if they see you opening a chest, or mining a block of gold, they will assume that you're stealing and will treat you accordingly
-   Piglins LOVE gold and get very distracted by gold items
-   Gold ingots are currency to piglins and you can throw ingots at them or right-click them with an ingot to barter for various goods
-   Piglins sometimes get hungry and hunt hoglins for food. Or they try at least. They results... vary.
-   Piglins prefer to hunt and fight in groups, and when a fight is happening everyone wants in
-   Piglins that somehow end up in the overworld become zombified fairly quickly
-   Piglins are creeped out by soul fire and zombified piglins, and will stay clear whenever possible
-   Wither skeletons are a historic enemy and piglins will attack on sight
-   Baby piglins are not as dangerous, but they can be mischievous so watch your back
-   ... and they like to play with baby hoglins

# Minecraft Snapshot 20w06a

## Features in 20w06a

-   Added new Nether blocks!
-   Knockback resistance is now a scale instead of a probability
-   Added Crimson Forest biome to the Nether
-   Added Hoglins - they don't do much yet, but they have cute flappy ears!
-   Patrols no longer spawn when the player is close to any village
-   Added Netherite!
-   Added Soulsand Valley biome to the Nether
-   Walls do not have gaps anymore when stacked vertically
-   Added Warped Forest biome to the Nether

### Blocks

Many new block types have been added!

-   Two new wood-like materials - Crimson Stems and Warped Stems
-   Basalt blocks - you can find them as pillars but they can be placed in any direction
-   New ground surface blocks: Crimson Nylium and Warped Nylium
-   New vegetation: Nether Sprouts, Crimson Roots and Warped Roots
-   Two types of Fungi: Crimson and Warped - try using bone meal to grow them!
-   Warped Wart blocks
-   Weeping Vines that grow from the bottom of a block downwards!
-   A new natural light source: Shroomlights
-   Added Soul Soil! Whenever fire burns on Soul Soil, it burns with a blue flame!
-   Soul Soil can be used to craft Soul Torches - and those can be crafted into Soul Lanterns!
-   Using bone meal on Netherrack can now spread Nylium

### Crimson Forest

Crimson Forests can now be found in the Nether!

-   Crimson nylium carpets the cave floor with all kinds of strange new vegetation
-   Huge Crimson Fungi make up the "trees" of this forest, with Shroomlights lighting up the forest floor
-   Weeping Vines grow from the cave ceilings and fungi
-   Hoglins wander these Forests
-   Crimson spores swirl through the air

### Netherite

-   A new high level material found in the Nether. Use it to upgrade your diamond gear!

#### How to make Netherite

-   Mine Ancient Debris in the lower depths of the Nether. At own risk. No insurance coverage for that.
-   Refine it into Netherite Scrap in a furnace (although that's kind of slow so you might want a Blast Furnace).
-   Combine 4 Nether Scrap with 4 Gold Ingots in a crafting table to make a Netherite Ingot.

#### Netherite effects

-   Netherite items float in lava. So you don't lose all your gear after that unplanned lava bath.
-   Netherite items have higher enchantment value than diamond (but not as high as gold).
-   Netherite tools work faster and last longer than diamond.
-   Netherite weapons do more damage than diamond.
-   Netherite armor have higher toughness and durability than diamond.
-   Netherite armor gives you knockback resistance, so you barely get knocked back at all when hit by arrows and such.
-   And it looks cool!

### Soulsand Valley

Soulsand Valleys can now be found in the Nether!

-   An open space made mostly of Soul Sand and Soul Soil
-   Basalt pillars span from floor to ceiling
-   Fossile remains of unknown creatures from the past litter the valley
-   Ash falls through the air
-   A light blue glow envelopes the valley
-   Beware of Skeletons here

### Sounds

-   Ghasts sounds are now heard at shorter range
-   Updated block sounds for Bone Blocks, Netherrack, Soul Sand, Netherwart, Nether Bricks and Quartz Ore

### Warped Forest

Warped Forests can now be found in the Nether!

-   Warped nylium carpets the cave floor with all kinds of strange new vegetation
-   Huge Warped Fungi make up the "trees" of this forest, with Shroomlights lighting up the forest floor
-   A dark blue fog covers the forest!
-   Warped spores swirl through the air
-   The Warped Forests are strange, but also the least hostile place of Nether

### World Generation

-   The old Nether biome is now called Nether Wastes
-   Made shipwrecks and ocean ruins a bit less common, so you get more excited when you find one!

## Technical changes in 20w06a

-   Added a `locatebiome` command

### Commands

#### locatebiome

New command that locates a specified biome. Useful in creative mode when you're looking for a specific biome and don't want to fly around randomly searching for it. Syntax: `locatebiome <biome>` Parameters:

-   `biome` - The id of the biome to find

### Particles

-   New particle types: ash, crimson\_spore, soul\_fire\_flame and warped\_spore
