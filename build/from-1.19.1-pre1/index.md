# Minecraft 1.19.1 Pre-Release 1

The first pre-release for 1.19.1 is now available. This release contains a few bugfixes, an increased cooldown for Allay duplication, and it also contains a new UI if you have been banned for violating the Minecraft [Community Standards](https://www.minecraft.net/community-standards). ​ On the topic of community standards and the recent introduction of the chat reporting feature, we’re working on creating a help article that aims to add some context surrounding the functionality. ​ All of this said, if everything goes as planned, we plan to release the update next Tuesday on June 28th.

-   Allay duplication now has a 5-minute cooldown
-   Along with the support for reporting chat, reported players can now be banned from online play and Realms after moderator review
-   The game will show a notice screen on startup if you have been banned from online play
    -   The reason for the ban is shown as well as how long the ban is valid for
