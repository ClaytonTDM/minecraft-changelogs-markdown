### Advancements

#### New triggers

##### `started_riding`

-   Triggered when player starts riding a vehicle or entity starts riding vehicle currently ridden by player
-   Conditions:
    -   `player` - either a player that started riding or one of boat passengers

##### `lightning_strike`

-   Triggered when lighting finishes (i.e. entity disappears)
-   Triggers for any player on server
-   Conditions
    -   `player` - player for which this trigger runs
    -   `lightning` - predicate for lightning entity
    -   `bystander` - predicate for one of the entities in certain area around strike not hurt by it

##### `using_item`

-   Triggered for every tick of using items (like crossbows, spyglass, fishing rods, etc)
-   Conditions
    -   `player` - players that uses item
    -   `item` - item being used

#### Changed triggers

##### `effects_changed`

-   Added `source` triggers that matches entity that triggered the change
-   Might be empty when:
    -   there is no entity (for example, effect gained from beacon)
    -   the effect is self-applied
    -   effect is removed

#### Changed predicates

##### Item predicate

-   `item` field expended to `items`, now accepting array of item types

##### Block predicate

-   `block` field expended to `blocks`, now accepting array of block types

##### Entity predicate

-   `passenger` - new sub-predicate for passenger directly riding this vehicle (if present, must match one or more)
-   `stepping_on` - location predicate for block entity is currently standing on
-   `lightning_bolt` - sub-predicate valid only for lightning bolt entity

##### Player predicate

-   `looking_at` - entity currently viewed by player
    -   uses same line-of-sight rules as attacking mobs
    -   actual detection radius might be changed in future

#### Lightning bolt

-   `blocks_set_on_fire` - range check for of blocks set on fire by this entity
-   `entity_struck` - predicate for entities struck by this lightning (if present, must match one or more)

### Performance metrics reporting

These will be saved to a zip file in `debug/profiling/<yyyy-MM-dd_HH.mm.ss-[levelname]-[version]>.zip` and could be used for performance regression analysis if included in bug reports.

The exact metrics, output format, and names are susceptible to change between versions. Our plan is to continue iterating on which metrics to capture.

#### Client F3+L shortcut

Pressing F3+L while in the game will start a recording for 10 seconds capturing metrics such as tick durations, used heap sizes and other more detailed stats.

Pressing F3+L before the 10-second limit will end the recording early.

This shortcut is always available to clients, even on multi-player servers where it will record client-side performance.

#### Dedicated Server perf start/stop command

`perf start` will start a recording for 10 seconds capturing metrics such as tick durations, used heap sizes and other more detailed stats.

`perf stop` before the 10-second limit will end the recording early.

We're now releasing 1.16.5 Release Candidate 1, which addresses two critical stability issues. If no further critical issues are found, we plan to release 1.16.5 on Friday. We hope to release another Caves & Cliffs snapshot next week.

Happy mining!

---

We have now released 1.16.4 Release Candidate 1. If no further critical issues are found, we expect this version to be the full release of 1.16.4 on Thursday.

## Changes in 1.16.4 Release Candidate 1

-   Added an option to hide matched names

### Hide matched names

-   Some servers send chat messages in non-standard formats. With this option on, the game will attempt to apply chat hiding anyway by matching the text in messages

## Fixed bugs in 1.16.4 Release Candidate 1

-   [MC-202614](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-202614) Search function in social interactions screen only finds names that begin with the letters that you typed in

---

Time for another pre-release! This time around we've fixed some issues with the new social interactions screen and we've also fixed some crashes.

In case you haven't heard, yesterday we announced that Mojang accounts will be migrating into Microsoft accounts. With this pre-release, we are preparing for that by having the game understand the settings and block-list of Microsoft accounts. You can read more about that over [here](https://www.minecraft.net/article/java-edition-moving-house), and you can find answers to questions you might have in the [FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/articles/360050865492). The FAQ will be continuously updated.

We aim to release 1.16.4 sometime during next week.

## Changes in 1.16.4 Pre-release 2

-   Players blocked in your Microsoft account are now also blocked in the game
-   A button to open a link to the Accessibility Guide can now be found in the Accessibility Options screen

### Social Interactions

-   The status of a player is now listed below their name on the Social Interactions screen
-   A new tab is available to filter by Blocked players in the Social Interactions screen
-   Chat from blocked players is always hidden
-   Realms invites from blocked players are hidden
