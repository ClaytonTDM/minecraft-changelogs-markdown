---

An absolutely shocking snapshot arrives! This snapshot adds some new functionality to Copper, some general tweaks, a fancy new way of getting performance metrics, and a bunch of bugfixes.

Happy mining!

## New Features in 21w11a

-   Lightning rods can now, for the very first time ever, be waterlogged
-   New functionality for applying and removing wax from copper
-   Bonemealing rooted dirt now grows hanging roots underneath

### Waxing Copper and Oxidization

-   Right click with honeycomb on copper blocks to wax them
-   Use honeycomb in a dispenser to wax copper blocks
-   Axes can scrape off wax and oxidation of copper blocks
-   Lightning strike hitting copper will clean its oxidation

## Changes in 21w11a

-   Waxed copper blocks can be crafted into 4 copper ingots
-   Tweaked the cave sizes
-   Slightly increased the frequency of diamond ore blobs
-   Hanging roots block now renders randomly offset
-   Breaking a Big Dripleaf stem now drops a Big Dripleaf block
-   Moss blocks can be crafted with cobblestone or stone bricks to make the mossy versions of those blocks
-   The facing direction of Small Dripleaf blocks is now determined by which direction the player is facing when placing it
-   Fully-grown Amethyst Clusters now drop 4 Amethyst Shards (or more with Fortune) when mined with a pickaxe, and drop 2 Amethyst Shards when broken by hand, piston, or other means

## Technical Changes in 21w11a

-   Added F3+L shortcut to generate and persist performance metrics from in-game

### In-game client metrics reporting

Pressing F3+L while in the game will start a recording for 10 seconds capturing metrics such as tick durations, used heap sizes and other more detailed stats. These will be saved to a zip file in `debug/profiling/<yyyy-MM-dd_HH.mm.ss>.zip` and could be used for performance regression analysis if included in bug reports.

The exact metrics, output format and names are susceptible to change between versions, and our plan is to continue iterating on which metrics to capture.

A truly fabulous snapshot enters the arena! This snapshot brings fundamental changes to our rendering pipeline with the introduction of the brand new tech that is OpenGL Core 3.2. On top of that, we're finally introducing the Lush Caves biome. However, as with the Dripstone Caves, this is only available through creating a custom world.

There's an important note about this snapshot for those of you with older computers: With the introduction of OpenGL Core 3.2 there is a chance Minecraft Java will no longer run on computers that do not meet the [minimum system requirements](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360035131371-Minecraft-Java-Edition-system-requirements-). Computers that meet the [minimum system requirements](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360035131371-Minecraft-Java-Edition-system-requirements-) should not be affected.

## New Features in 21w10a

-   Added Lush Caves underground biome!
-   Added Cracked Deepslate Bricks and Cracked Deepslate Tiles
-   There is now an Infested variant of Deepslate found in the underground
-   While they will not generate in the world by default, Deepslate versions of copper, emerald and coal ores have been added for use by creators of maps and data packs

### Lush caves biome

The Lush Caves underground biome now exists for use in single-biome worlds. It does not yet generate in other world types.

-   Moss covers the floors and ceilings
-   Spore Blossoms grow from the ceiling and drip particles
-   Contains clay pools with dripleaf plants grow out of them
-   Contains azalea bushes and flowering azalea bushes
-   The azalea tree loves to have its roots in lush caves, so if you find an azalea tree (either overground or in a cave) you know there is a lush cave beneath you
-   Cave vines with glow berries grow from the ceiling and light up the caves

## Changes in 21w10a

-   Cobbled Deepslate can now be smelted into Deepslate.
-   Deepslate can now be placed along any axis
-   Lightning rods can now be waterlogged
-   Fossils in the deepest part of the underground generate with deepslate diamond ore instead of coal ore
-   Some ore textures have been updated

### Ore distribution

Overworld ore generation has been tweaked.

-   More emeralds in mountains
-   More lapis
-   Less copper, gold, and redstone
-   Smaller diamond blobs, but slightly more frequent. Less diamond ore overall though
-   Less iron, and it generates lower down
-   Reduced air exposure for coal

## Technical Changes in 21w10a

-   The game now runs using OpenGL 3.2 core profile
-   The maximum size that slimes can be summoned with is now 128
-   The `give` command can only give up to 100 stacks of items at a time (e.g. 6400 stone or 100 iron swords)

### OpenGL

Rendering is now using OpenGL 3.2 core profile. All fixed function rendering has been replaced with shader based rendering.

#### Shaders

Shaders are now included for all supported render states. Any shader except for the `blit` shader can also be replaced in resource packs. For now replacing these shaders is **not officially supported** and the way it works may change in the future.

The current rendering engine uses a system similar to the post processing shader pipeline. There are some differences between both system that cater to the slightly different requirements.
