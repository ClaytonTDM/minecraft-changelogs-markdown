# Minecraft Snapshot 25w02a

It's the first snapshot Wednesday of 2025, and we have some fun new features to kick off the new year. This snapshot adds new ambient features to the game, including wildflowers, leaf litter, and falling leaves. Pigs are getting two new variants: you may venture into the colder biomes to find the cold pig, or head for sunnier spots to meet its counterpart â€“ the warm pig! Lodestones are also becoming easier to craft, making them more accessible in the early game. Now you'll only need an iron ingot with your chiseled stone bricks.

## New Features

-   Lodestones can now be found as loot at Ruined Portals in the Overworld or Nether

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 62
-   The Resource Pack version is now 47

## Data Pack Version 62

-   Changes to commands
-   Updated data format of Text Components
-   `structure_block` in the `load` mode has now a new option: `Strict Placement`
    -   If set to `false`, the blocks in the placed structure will not trigger block updates, block entity side effects, or shape updates
-   The `Owner` field of tamed animals is no longer restricted to referencing Players
-   Updated data format of equipment drop chances in entity data
-   Added data-driven registry for pig variants
-   Added `pig` entity sub-predicate for matching pig variants

### Commands

-   Text Components in commands such as `/tellraw` or `/title` are now specified with SNBT instead of JSON
-   Text Style in the `/scoreboard` command when specifying the `styled` number format is also now specified with SNBT instead of JSON
-   The behavior of `setblock` and `fill` commands have changed in how they handle block entity data:
    -   If the block entity data is not specified, and the existing block has data, the block entity data will be preserved
    -   If the block entity data is specified, the block entity data will be set to the specified value
    -   To clear the block entity data explicitly, you must now specify the block entity data as `{}`
    -   The operation is now successful if either the block state changed or the block entity data changed
-   `fill`, `clone`, `setblock` and `place template` accept a new option: `strict`
    -   If specified, the command will place blocks as-is without triggering block updates and shape updates
-   The `replace` option in the `fill` command is no longer terminal, and can be followed with additional options
-   New syntax for commands to use the new `strict` option, and more flexible use of `replace`:
    -   `fill <from> <to> <block> keep`
    -   `fill <from> <to> <block> [replace <filter>]? [strict|destroy|hollow|outline]?`
    -   `clone [from <sourceDimension>]? <begin> <end> [to <targetDimension>]? <destination> [strict]? [[replace|masked|filtered <filter>] [force|move|normal]?]?`
    -   `setblock <pos> <block> [destroy|keep|replace|strict]?`
    -   `place template <template> [<pos> [<rotation> [<mirror> [<integrity> [<seed> [strict]?]?]?]?]?]?`

### Text Component Data Format

-   Text Components are no longer stored as JSON wrapped by a string
-   The format itself is the same as before, but inlined directly into the outer structure
-   For example, the item component `minecraft:custom_name="{\"text\":\"Renamed item\"}"` will become `minecraft:custom_name={text:'Renamed item'}`
-   This includes Text Components passed as arguments to commands such as `/tellraw` or `/title`
    -   For example, `/tellraw @s "\"text\":\"Hello world\""` may become `/tellraw @s {text:'Hello world'}`
-   Note: in the case where Text Components are embedded in NBT, no distinction exists between boolean and integer types
    -   To pass boolean arguments to translations, you must use the string form
-   For Text Components with the `nbt` type and `interpret` set to `true`, Text Components will be parsed from the given NBT directly rather than converting to string and parsing as JSON
-   The format of hover and click events has been updated

#### Hover Events

-   The `hoverEvent` field has been renamed to `hover_event`
-   The legacy `value` field (which was parsed from a rendered text component) is no longer supported
-   For the `show_text` action:
    -   `contents` field has been renamed to `text`
    -   e.g. `{action:'show_text',contents:'Hello world'}` becomes `{action:'show_text',text:'Hello world'}`
-   For the `show_item` action:
    -   The `contents` field has been inlined
    -   e.g. `{action:'show_item',contents:{id:'minecraft:stick',count:2}}` becomes `{action:'show_item',id:'minecraft:stick',count:2}`
    -   If contents was specified only as an item id, it is replaced with the full format and inlined
    -   e.g. `{action:'show_item',contents:'minecraft:stick'}` becomes `{action:'show_item',id:'minecraft:stick'}`
-   For the `show_entity` action:
    -   The `contents` field has been inlined
    -   The `id` field has been renamed to `uuid`
    -   The `type` field has been renamed to `id`
    -   e.g. `{action:'show_entity',contents:{id:[I;0,0,0,0],type:'minecraft:pig'}}` becomes `{action:'show_entity',uuid:[I;0,0,0,0],id:'minecraft:pig'}`

#### Click Events

-   The `clickEvent` field has been renamed to `click_event`
-   For the `open_url` action:
    -   The `value` field has been renamed to `url`
    -   The click event will no longer parse if not a valid URI with either `https://` or `http://` schemes, instead of simply not working
    -   e.g. `{action:'open_url',value:'https://minecraft.net'}` becomes `{action:'open_url',url:'https://minecraft.net'}`
-   For the `run_command` action:
    -   The `value` field has been renamed to `command`
    -   The click event will no longer parse if the command contains disallowed characters, instead of simply not working
    -   It is no longer required that the specified `command` field has a `/` prefix
    -   e.g. `{action:'run_command',value:'/say Hi'}` becomes `{action:'run_command',command:'/say Hi'}`
-   For the `suggest_command` action:
    -   The `value` field has been renamed to `command`
    -   The click event will no longer parse if the command contains disallowed characters, instead of simply not working
    -   e.g. `{action:'suggest_command',value:'/help'}` becomes `{action:'suggest_command',command:'/help'}`
-   For the `change_page` action:
    -   The `value` field has been renamed to `page`
    -   The `page` value now requires a positive integer instead of a string
    -   e.g. `{action:'change_page',value:'1'}` becomes `{action:'change_page',page:1}`
-   The `copy_to_clipboard` format is unchanged

    -   Format: map between equipment slot type and chance value
        -   Valid equipment slots: `head`, `chest`, `legs`, `feet`, `mainhand`, `offhand`, `body`

    -   e.g. `"result": {"id": "minecraft:stick", "count": 3, "components": {"!minecraft:damage": {}, "minecraft:enchantment_glint_override": {}}}`
-   The field can still be defined as before as an inline item id (e.g. `"result": "minecraft:stick"`)

Sharpen your pickaxes, another snapshot is here! In today's snapshot we have a bunch of component improvements coming your way, Resin Clumps can be waterlogged now, and Rabbits can finally roam free again. Furthermore, there's a whole swarm of other bug fixes.

## Changes

-   Wither Skeletons no longer have Bows as their preferred weapon
-   Creakings will now persist when a world is reloaded
-   Mining speed and blast resistance of creaking hearts is doubled
-   Resin sounds have been adjusted to be softer
-   Resin Clump block can be placed on any full face of a neighboring block

        -   default value is `""`, which means "root" locale (a set of defaults, including English names)
    -   `time_zone` - optional value describing time zone
        -   If not present, defaults to timezone set on client
        -   Examples:

We're back in the shipping room to serve you the first snapshot release for Minecraft: Java Edition 1.21.4! It's coming in hot with some new pale goodies in the form of Eyeblossoms and Resin, two new additions to the Pale Garden biome. You'll also find that leaves will now fall from the Pale Oak trees in said biome, something we hope will crank up the eerie atmosphere even further. In addition to that, this release is also bringing a collection of technical updates and bug fixes.

Happy mining!

## New Features

The `winter_drop` is no longer an experiment.

### Added Eyeblossoms

Eyeblossoms are new flowers that generate in the Pale Garden biome. Unique features:

-   They exist in two variants: Closed and Open Eyeblossom
-   Eyeblossoms transition between the two variants based on the time of day
    -   During the night, Eyeblossoms will become Open
    -   During the day, they will become Closed
    -   In dimensions that do not have a day/night cycle, they will remain as-is
    -   When transitioning, flowers will emit a particle effect
-   Eyeblossoms planted on the ground will communicate with each other, helping each other to open or close
-   Open Eyeblossoms have glowing eyes during the night
-   Eyeblossoms can be obtained by bonemealing the grass in the Pale Garden biome
-   Bees get poisoned when they touch Eyeblossoms
-   Bees can be tempted by Eyeblossoms, but they get poisoned on player interaction instead of typical breeding/growing behaviour
-   Suspicious Stew made from Eyeblossom will have Blindness or Nausea effect depending on the variant
-   Gray or Orange Dye can be crafted from Closed and Open Eyeblossoms respectively
-   Wandering Trader can sell Open Eyeblossoms

### Added Resin Clump, Block of Resin, Resin Brick, and a family of Resin Bricks blocks

-   Attacking a Creaking will cause its Creaking Heart to exude 2 to 3 Resin Clumps
-   Resin Clump spawns on the sides of Pale Oak Logs that are close, and are connected to the Creaking Heart
-   Creaking Heart is on cooldown and cannot produce more Resin Clumps for 5 seconds after an attack
-   Resin Clump can be used as a material for armor trimming
-   Block of Resin is a storage block for Resin Clumps
-   Resin Clumps can be smelted into Resin Brick items
-   Resin Brick items can be crafted into Resin Bricks, Resin Brick Slabs, Resin Brick Stairs, Resin Brick Walls, and then Chiseled Resin Bricks
-   Resin Clump and Resin Block does not require a tool and are mined instantly
-   The proper tool for Resin Bricks family of blocks is a pickaxe
-   Resin Clumps can be found in the Woodland Mansion chest loot

## Changes

-   The panorama has been updated
-   Sword is no longer efficient to break Moss Carpet. The proper tool for Moss Carpet remains the Hoe
-   Bees are now withered on player interactions with Wither Roses instead of typical breeding/growing behavior

### Required tools for drops

> **Developer's Note**: _We made it so any block that drops when its support is broken will also drop when mined with any tool. It seemed unfair that breaking a block directly could destroy it if it was possible to obtain it with any tool just by breaking the block below!_

-   The following blocks that require support now always drop when broken with any tool: Bell, Lantern, Soul Lantern, all Copper Doors, Iron Door, Heavy Weighted Pressure Plate, Light Weighted Pressure Plate, Polished Blackstone Pressure Plate, and Stone Pressure Plate
-   The Brewing Stand now drops when broken with any tool
-   The Ender Chest now drops Obsidian when broken with an incorrect tool, instead of dropping nothing

### Pale Garden

-   Pale Garden has no music and if a player enters the biome while music is playing, the music will fade out

### Creaking Heart

-   Creaking Heart can be obtained by using a Silk Touch enchanted tool
-   Creaking Heart can be crafted with a Resin Block and Pale Oak Logs
-   Naturally placed Creaking Hearts drop 20-24 experience when broken by a player, with or without silk touch
-   Breaking a Creaking Heart block will drop a 1-3 Resin Clumps, and it is affected by Fortune enchantment

### Pale Oak Tree

-   Pale Oak Leaves have a chance to spawn leaf particles if exposed on the bottom side
-   Player grown Pale Oak trees grow without any decorations
-   Naturally generated Pale Oak trees have Pale Hanging Moss hanging from the foliage, Pale Moss patches on the ground, and Creaking Heart blocks can generate in them
-   Wandering Trader can sell Pale Oak Saplings

### Pale Moss Block

-   Wandering Trader can sell a Pale Moss Block

### Pale Hanging Moss

-   Pale Hanging Moss breaks instantly when mined
-   Pale Hanging Moss requires shears or silk touch tools to be obtained
-   Wandering Trader can sell Pale Hanging Moss

### Creaking mob

-   Creaking melee attacks deal 3 points of damage (1.5 hearts)
-   Illagers are scared of Creaking and will run away from them

The following changes apply for naturally spawning Creaking:

-   Creaking reacts only to damage caused by mobs and projectiles, by swaying in place
-   Creaking ignores Cactus, Sweet Berry Bushes and Powder Snow damage and can now walk through/over them
-   Creaking has a twitching animation
-   Is fire-resistant
-   Creaking Heart decides to remove or replace the connected Creaking when:
    -   It turns day
    -   The Creaking is too far away from the Creaking Heart
    -   A player intersects with the Creaking for a few seconds

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 58
-   The Resource Pack version is now 43
-   Removed the `winter_drop` feature flag and built-in data pack

## Data Pack Version 58

-   `trail` particle has a new required field: `duration`
    -   Indicates, in ticks, how long the particle will take to fly from the start to the target
-   `simple_block` feature type has a new optional field: `schedule_tick`
    -   If set to `true`, the block will be scheduled to tick
-   biome effects have a new format for `music` using a weighted list
    -   The list can be empty indicating no music should play in this biome
-   biome effects have a new optional field: `music_volume`
    -   The game will smoothly transition between the current music volume and the new volume when entering the biome

      "music": [
        {
          "data": {
            "max_delay": 24000,
            "min_delay": 12000,
            "replace_current_music": false,
            "sound": "minecraft:music.overworld.forest"
          },
          "weight": 1
        }
      ],
      "music_volume": 1.0,
    

-   Item blocks with `minecraft:block_entity_data` component will now set block entity data only if `id` tag matches type of placed block entity
    -   Additionally, a warning will be added to item tooltip if placing such item might directly or indirectly lead to command execution with high permission level

### Commands

-   Suggestions will now be shown for attribute modifier IDs existing on the target in the `attribute` command

#### `attribute` Command

New subcommand to reset the base value of an attribute to its default value for the target entity. If the attribute does not exist on the entity, the command will fail.

Syntax:

    attribute <target> <attribute> base reset 
    

Parameters:

-   `target`: The entity to update the attribute for
-   `attribute`: The attribute ID to update

### TNT Minecart Data

-   The `TNTFuse` field of TNT Minecarts has been renamed to `fuse`
-   Addeded optional field `explosion_speed_factor` that controls the amount of added damage depending on the speed of the Minecart
    -   Default value: `1.0`

### Text Components

Added optional `shadow_color` style field to Text Components, which overrides the shadow properties of text.

-   Format:
    -   A packed integer ARGB value (e.g. `-1`)
    -   An array of RGBA values (e.g. `[1, 1, 1, 1]`)
-   If specified as `0`, the shadow will never be displayed for this text
-   If specified as a non-zero value, the shadow will always be displayed with this color

## Resource Pack Version 43

    -   `chiseled_resin_bricks`
