# Minecraft Snapshot 25w31a

Oh, how we have yearned for the shipping room! We're back with our first snapshot release of the season, bringing you a big bundle of features from our third game drop of the year. Test the copper golem and copper chest for a tidier, livelier base, and watch your helper oxidize and turn into a statue, complete with adorable, redstone signal-emitting poses. Build functional decor using the brand-new shelves and try out copper weapons, tools and armor. To top it off, this release also includes copper horse armor and oxidizing lightning rods, in addition to a slew of bug fixes and technical changes.

Happy mining!

-   Added Shelf

### Copper Chest

-   Copper Chests is a new type of chest that has waxed and oxidized variants
-   Copper Chests oxidizes over time and can be waxed like other Copper blocks
-   Copper Chests can be crafted using a Chest and Copper Ingots

### Copper Golem

-   Copper Golem is a new mob which can be spawned by placing a Jack o'Lantern or Carved Pumpkin on top of a Copper block
-   Copper Golem oxidize over time and can be waxed like Copper blocks
-   If the Copper Golem has fully oxidized and is not waxed it will turn into a Copper Golem Statue Block

    -   A Copper Golem turned into a Copper Golem Statue will keep its name if named with a Name Tag
-   Copper Golem can help with sorting items into Chests
-   Interacting with the Copper Golem with an empty hand will make it drop its carried item

#### Copper Golem Item Sorting

-   If the Copper Golem is not holding an item, it will look for nearby Copper Chests to try to pick up an item
    -   The Copper Golem will look in any oxidized and waxed Copper Chest variant to pick up items
    -   It can pick up at most 16 items in a stack at a time
    -   Any item in a Copper Chest can be picked up
-   If the Copper Golem is holding an item, it will look for nearby Chests to try to place the item in
    -   The Copper Golem will look in Chests and Trapped Chests to try to place items
    -   It can place an item in a Chest if it's empty, or if it contains the same type of item that it is holding in its hand
-   The Copper Golem will visit at most 10 Chests or Copper Chests in sequence to try to pick up or place an item
-   If no matching chest is found the Copper Golem will idle for 7 seconds before trying again
-   The search area for chests from the Copper Golem's position is horizontally 32 blocks and vertically 8 blocks

### Copper Golem Statue Block

-   The Copper Golem Statue Block is a new type of decorative block which has waxed and oxidized variants
-   The Copper Golem Statue Block oxidizes over time and can be waxed like Copper blocks
-   The pose of the block can be changed by interacting with it
-   If the Copper Golem Statue Block has no oxidation when interacted with using an Axe the block will turn into a Copper Golem

-   Added Copper Horse Armor
    -   Has the same loot table and chance of generating as Iron Horse Armor
    -   Armor toughness: 4

### Shelf

-   The Shelf is a new type of decorative block which comes in the following variants:
    -   Oak
    -   Spruce
    -   Birch
    -   Jungle
    -   Acacia
    -   Dark Oak
    -   Mangrove
    -   Cherry
    -   Pale Oak
    -   Bamboo
    -   Crimson
    -   Warped
-   The Shelf can be crafted from six matching blocks of any Stripped Log, Stripped Stem or Block of Stripped Bamboo, filling the top and bottom row
    -   This recipe produces 6 Shelves
-   The Shelf can store up to 3 item stacks:
    -   Interacting with any of the 3 slots on its front swaps the player's main hand item with the content of that slot
    -   The Shelf displays all items it contains in front of it, similar to an Item Frame
-   While a Shelf is powered by Redstone, its front texture changes to reflect that it's powered; when placed next to each other, up to 3 powered Shelves will connect
    -   Interacting with a single powered Shelf swaps all its contents with the 3 rightmost items in the player's hotbar
    -   Interacting with two connected Shelves swaps their contents with the 6 rightmost items in the player's hotbar
    -   Interacting with three connected Shelves swaps their contents with all items in the player's hotbar
    -   It does not matter which of the connected Shelves the player interacts with

### Accessibility

-   The "Attack/Destroy" and "Use Item/Place Block" keybinds are now toggleable, meaning they can be set to either "Hold" or "Toggle" in the Controls screen
-   Added "Invert Mouse X" option to the Mouse Settings screen, which inverts the mouse x-axis
-   Added "Sprint Window" option to the Controls screen, which represents the time window in ticks where double-tapping the forward key activates sprint

## Changes

-   Monster Spawn Eggs now have a tooltip warning when the difficulty is set to Peaceful
    -   The mob no longer spawns for one tick when an attempt is made to use the Spawn Egg
-   The debug screen was reworked to be less cluttered and more configurable
-   Changes to world loading and the "Spawn Chunks"
-   A dimension that has any player activity, forceloaded chunks, active portals, or Ender Pearls in flight will be considered "active" and will keep processing chunks and entities
    -   Previously, this would only apply if a player was in the dimension or a chunk was forceloaded

### World Loading and Spawn Chunks

-   The concept of fixed "Spawn Chunks" has been removed
-   The game will ensure that the following chunks are fully loaded before the player joins or the server starts, in the same way as spawn chunks formerly were:
    -   Chunks loaded by the `forceload` command
    -   Chunks active due to portal activity
    -   Ender Pearls thrown in Singleplayer (Singleplayer only)
    -   The small area of chunks around the player (Singleplayer only)
    -   Chunks required to assign the global world spawn (World creation only)
-   The world loading screen now shows the chunks that the player is about to be placed into, rather than chunks loaded around world spawn
-   The loading screen additionally now includes a progress bar
    -   This progress bar accounts for all kinds of chunk loading as mentioned above

> **Developerâ€™s Note:** _Spawn chunks incur a memory and performance cost for all players and have outlived their initial technical purpose of keeping the spawn area ready for players to quickly join into._

> _However, we also want to recognise that spawn chunks have enabled a multitude of clever contraptions and farms throughout the years, so simply removing them without having other mechanics in the game enable these designs was never an option._

> _We believe that the niche held by spawn chunks has now been filled by alternative methods of chunk loading, such as using portals or ender pearls, particularly with the changes in this snapshot to how the game loads these chunks before the world starts ticking._

### Sounds

-   Happy ghast is now audible from 64 blocks
-   Sounds for chests now plays at a lower volume
-   The volume at which a sound is played at now respects the sound source volume value
-   The "Voice/Speech" sound source has been rephrased to "Narrator/Voice"

### UI

#### Debug Screen

-   The debug screen is accessible by pressing F3, as before
-   It can now be accessed from everywhere in the game, not only when in a game world
-   It now displays less information by default
-   Added a new Debug Options screen which can be opened by pressing F3 + F5
    -   It can be used to configure which debug information should be displayed
    -   For each item you can choose if it should be turned off, visible when the debug screen (F3) is open, or it should always be visible, even when the debug screen is closed
    -   Some debug features that were previously available, like chunk border rendering or entity hitbox rendering, can now be toggled through this debug options screen
    -   Some debug features that were not previously available to the community, like Octree visualization, are now accessible through the debug options screen
    -   The state of the debug options screen is saved between the launches of the game
    -   The debug options screen has the following preset profiles:
        -   `Default` resets everything to the default state
        -   `Performance` shows simple performance metrics, including the FPS meter always visible on screen

> **Developer's Note**: _Previously the information gathering every frame to render the F3 screen had a significant performance cost. So opening the screen to check you FPS noticably dropped the FPS. Now checking your FPS in `Performance` profile should not affect game performance._

### Accessibility

-   A button leading to the Controls screen has been added to the Accessibility Settings screen
    
    -   The "Auto-Jump" option, as well as the "Sneak" and "Sprint" toggles have been removed from the Accessibility Settings screen
-   The "Show Subtitles" option has been rephrased to "Closed Captions" to more accurately describe what it does
    
-   Dye Colors now have updated icons
    
    -   The goal with these is to enhance visual cohesion across the dye set while maintaining distinct shapes to support colorblind accessibility

### Performance Improvements

-   Entity rendering order was improved for significantly better performance
    -   Youâ€™ll notice much smoother gameplay in areas with lots of mobs, like mob farms
    -   FPS wonâ€™t improve much if most of your lag comes from things other than entities, like playing with high render distance while not being near many mobs

> **Developer's Note**: _This change is quite big, and we would not be surprised if we introduced some ordering issues with this. For example, some part of some mob rendering too early or too late and is not visible or is visually broken. Please play around with this and report the bugs you encounter!_

## Technical Changes

-   Pack versions now have minor versions
-   The Data Pack version is now 82.0
-   The Resource Pack version is now 65.0

### Pack Formats

-   The pack versions for data packs and resource packs now have minor versions
    -   A minor version increment of the game's pack version is backwards-compatible, meaning all packs made for previous iterations of the same major version will keep working
-   Packs can set compatibility requirements on minor versions in case they rely on resources introduced in a minor version

#### Pack Metadata

The pack.mcmeta format has been updated:

-   The `supported_formats` field has been removed
    -   If your pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack < 82, resource pack < 65), it is still required
    -   Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed
-   The `pack_format` field is now optional
    -   If your pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack < 82, resource pack < 65), it is still required
-   Added required field `min_format` - specifies the minimum version supported
    -   A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g `[74, 1]`
    -   Specifying a single integer is interpreted as that major version, e.g. `74` is the same thing as `[74, 0]`
    -   Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone
-   Added required field `max_format` - specified the maximum version supported
    -   A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g `[74, 1]`
    -   Specifying a single integer is interpreted as any minor version, i.e. the minor version is `0x7fffffff`
    -   Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone
-   For overlay entries:
    -   The `formats` field has been removed
        -   If your pack includes any overlay range that includes a pack version with the previous format (data pack < 82, resource pack < 65), it is still required for all overlay definitions
        -   Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed
    -   Added required field `min_format` and `max_format` with the same formats the fields above with the same name for the `pack` section

## Data Pack Version 82.0

### Commands

-   The `summon` command now fails when trying to summon monsters while the difficulty is set to Peaceful

### Game Rules

-   Removed `spawnChunkRadius` game rule

### Data Components

#### `blocks_attacks` Item Component

-   If the damage reduced in an attack is `0`, for example by `angle` threshold not matching, the item can no longer get disabled in the attack, nor cause knockback due to blocking

### Loot Tables

-   Added `minecraft:entity_interact` loot table type which takes the following parameters:
    -   `target_entity`, the entity being interacted with
    -   `interacting_entity`, the optional entity that is interacting with the `target_entity`
    -   `tool`, the tool used to interact with `target_entity`
-   Added `minecraft:block_interact` loot table type which takes the following parameters:
    -   `block_state`, the block state of the block entity being interacted with
    -   `block_entity`, the optional block entity being interacted with
    -   `interacting_entity`, the optional entity that is interacting with the `block_state`
    -   `tool`, the optional tool used to interact with `block_state`
-   Fields that specify a target entity in a loot table, such as `entity_properties.entity`, can additionally target the `target_entity` and `interacting_entity` parameter types
-   Added `charged_creeper/root` loot table for drops when an entity is killed by a Charged Creeper
    -   This loot table dispatches on the mob that was killed, to the following loot tables:
        -   `charged_creeper/piglin`
        -   `charged_creeper/creeper`
        -   `charged_creeper/skeleton`
        -   `charged_creeper/wither_skeleton`
        -   `charged_creeper/zombie`
    -   Once any mob killed drops an item from this loot table, other mobs killed by the same Creeper will not drop from this loot table
-   Added `brush/armadillo` loot table for drops when an Armadillo is brushed
-   Added `gameplay/turtle_grow` loot table for drops when a Turtle grows into an adult
-   Added `harvest/beehive` loot table for drops when a Beehive or Bee Nest is harvested using Shears
-   Added `harvest/cave_vine` loot table for drops when a Cave Vine with Glowberries is harvested by interacting with it
-   Added `carve/pumpkin` loot table for drops when a Pumpkin is carved using Shears

### World Generation

-   The `initial_density_without_jaggedness` field in `noise_settings` definitions has been replaced with a `preliminary_surface_level` field
    -   `initial_density_without_jaggedness` was a 3D density function that was used to determine an approximate surface level by scanning for the first point with a density greater than `0.390625`
    -   `preliminary_surface_level` is a 2D density function that should produce the y-level of the approximate surface
    -   The `minecraft:find_top_surface` density function can be used to replicate the previous scanning

#### Density Functions

##### Added `minecraft:find_top_surface`

-   Approximates the topmost surface of a given density function
-   It scans from an upper bound to a lower bound to find the point at which the density changes from negative to positive
    -   The upper bound should be as close to the actual surface for best performance
    -   The upper bound should never be lower than the actual surface

Fields:

-   `density` - density function to approximate the surface of
-   `upper_bound` - 2D density function providing the highest possible y-value
-   `lower_bound` - integer, lowest possible y-value
-   `cell_height` - positive integer defining the grid resolution on which to scan

##### Added `minecraft:invert`

-   Resolves to `1/argument`

Fields:

-   `argument` - density function

#### Jigsaw Structures

-   The `max_distance_from_center` field may now specify a different restriction on the vertical axis from horizontal
    -   This can be specified by an object with fields:
        -   `horizontal` - required integer between `1` and `128`
        -   `vertical` - optional integer between `1` and `4096` (default: `4096`)
        -   e.g: `"max_distance_from_center": { "horizontal": 20, "vertical": 500 }`
    -   The previous format of a single inline value specifying both horizontal and vertical distance is still supported

### Tags

#### Block Tags

-   Added `#copper_chests` - all Copper Chest blocks
-   Added `#copper` - all Copper blocks
-   Added `#incorrect_for_copper_tool` - all blocks which will not drop items with a copper tool
-   Added `#copper_golem_statues` - all Copper Golem Statue blocks

#### Item Tags

-   Added `#copper_chests` - all Copper Chest block items
-   Added `#copper` - all Copper block items
-   Added `#copper_tool_materials` - all copper tool materials
-   Added `#repairs_copper_armor` - all items which repair copper armor
-   Added `#copper_golem_statues` - all Copper Golem Statue block items

### Shaders & Post-process Effects

> **Developer's Note**: _Although it is possible in Resource Packs, overriding Core Shaders is considered as unsupported and not an intended Resource Pack feature. These shaders exist as part of the internal implementation of the game, and as such, may change at any time as the game's internals evolve. We understand that overriding Core Shaders is used for very cool Resource Pack features, many of which lack supported alternatives. We would like to provide better, supported alternatives in the future._

#### Changes to Full Screen Passes

-   The following vertex shaders have been removed, and replaced by `core/screenquad.vsh`:
    -   `core/blit_screen.vsh`
    -   `post/blit.vsh`
    -   `post/blur.vsh`
    -   `post/invert.vsh`
    -   `post/sobel.vsh`
    -   `post/screenquad.vsh`
-   Vertex shaders for post-processing effects, as well as lightmap generation and full screen blits are no longer are passed the `Position` attribute, and instead must assign vertex coordinates by `gl_VertexID`
-   These passes furthermore are only executed with 3 vertices, instead of a full quad

-   The Resource Pack version is now 61
-   "Command Syntax" report now contains information about required permission level

## Data Pack Version 77

-   New optional fields `can_be_sheared` and `shearing_sound` have been added to the `equippable` item component
-   Added a way to display very simple dialogs to users
-   Added `custom` - a new `click_event` action type for text components
-   Users will now be prompted for confirmation before executing a command from the `run_command` click action in books and chat if the command can't be parsed or requires elevated permissions (i.e. higher than 0)

### Dialogs

-   Added a way to display simple modal dialogs to a user
-   Dialogs are stored in a `minecraft:dialog` registry, but can also be defined inline
-   Dialogs are an experimental feature
-   To avoid user confusion, dialog screens are marked with a warning sign next to the title
    -   Clicking on this warning leads to a dialog that explains to user that this screen is provided by custom content
    -   It also gives user an option to leave current world to avoid them being locked in infinite loop of dialogs
-   Dialogs can be displayed by server in `play` and `configuration` connection phases
    -   However, only inline registries are allowed in `configuration`, since registries are not yet available in that phase
-   Dialogs always close after user selects any action
-   Dialogs by default will also close after Escape key is pressed
    -   When this happens, dialog will run action specific to dialog type described as "exit action" below
    -   This behavior is configurable
-   When dialog screen is closed, game goes back to previously displayed non-dialog screen or back to gameplay
    -   That means that new dialogs always replace already opened ones, if any
-   Dialogs screens will pause the game in singleplayer mode
-   Dialogs can be configured to be accessible from Pause menu
    -   This replaces and expands "Server Links" button added in previous versions
-   Most dialogs follow a common layout, however exact contents depend on type:
    -   Header with title and warning button
    -   Body elements (labels, inputs, buttons and submit actions), scrollable if needed
    -   Optional footer, contains main buttons and submit actions

> **Developer's Note**: _Dialogs are not supposed to fully describe any in-game UI, but just to allow custom content to display simple messages and get input from users. This feature is intentionally limited to match that use case._

-   This method will build a custom server click action using a provided macro template and send it to the server (same as `minecraft:custom` click event)
-   Macro will be expanded with values from input
    -   Inputs not used in macro will be ignored, while macro parameters not matching any inputs will be replaced with an empty string

Fields:

-   `template` - a string with a macro template to be used as a payload
-   `id` - namespaced ID

###### `minecraft:custom_form`

-   This method will build a custom server click action from all values and request the server to run it (same as `minecraft:custom` click event)
-   Format:
    -   keys are separated from values with horizontal tabulation (`U+0009`) character
    -   key-value entries are separated with line feed (`U+000A`) character
    -   If characters `U+0009` and `U+000A` are present in any key or value, they will be escaped to `;;t;;` and `;;n;;`

Fields:

-   `id` - namespaced ID

##### Built-in dialogs

The built-in datapack contains some custom dialogs to provide customization of specific screens used by client

###### `minecraft:server_links`

-   Replacement for previously existing "Server Links" screen
-   Meant to simplify migration for servers that used this feature previously

###### `minecraft:custom_options`

-   Shows contents of `minecraft:pause_screen_additions` tag (see below)
-   Lets user select a specific dialog if this tag contains multiple entries
-   Note: Since this tag is meant for interoperability, any content that replaces this dialog should be careful to not hide other dialog providers

#### Dialog Command

-   New command has been added to show dialog to clients

Syntax:

-   `dialog show <targets> <dialog>` - show dialog to player(s)
    -   `<targets>` - player name, UUID or a player selector
    -   `<dialog>` - a namespaced ID from `minecraft:dialog` registry or inline dialog value as described above
    -   Returns number of players in `targets` argument
-   `dialog clear <targets>` - clean dialog for player(s), if they have any visible
    -   `<targets>` - player name, UUID or a player selector
    -   Returns number of players in `targets` argument

#### Pause Screen Configuration

-   A data pack can request some of the available dialogs to be accessible from Pause screen
-   This feature replaces "Server Links" button and is placed on Pause screen according to the same rules
-   Buttons leading to dialogs exposed in this way will use label described in `external_title` field
-   This feature is configured by `minecraft:pause_screen_additions` dialog tag:
    -   If this tag is not specified or is empty but the server has sent `server_links` packet, tag will be handled as if it contained `minecraft:server_links` dialog
        -   Note: this matches previous Server Links feature behavior
        -   If this dialog is removed, the tag remains empty
    -   If this tag is still empty, button is not visible ("Send Feedback" and "Report Bugs" buttons are visible instead)
    -   If this tag has a single element, Pause screen button will lead directly to this dialog
    -   If this tag has multiple elements, Pause screen button will lead to `minecraft:custom_options` which (by default) lets user select one of the tag elements
        -   If this dialog is removed, button is not visible

### Text Components

#### Click Events

-   New click action `minecraft:custom` has been added
    -   When user clicks a component with this click action, client will send a dedicated packet `minecraft:custom_click_action` to a server
    -   The intended use is as an alternative for `run_command` to be used by modded servers without worrying about having to add custom commands
    -   This packet has no functionality on vanilla servers
    -   Fields:
        -   `id` - namespaced ID
        -   `payload` - optional string field

#### Dialog Click Event

-   New action `show_dialog` has been added
    -   When user clicks this component, a dialog will be opened for them
    -   Fields:
        -   `dialog` - a namespaced ID from `minecraft:dialog` registry or inline dialog value as described above

### Attributes

#### Ghasts `flying_speed` attribute

-   Ghasts now have a `flying_speed` attribute that affects their flying speed

### Data Components

#### `equippable` Item Component

-   Added new optional field: `can_be_sheared` (boolean)
    -   If `true`, players can use Shears to remove this equippable item from a target mob by right-clicking, provided all other shearing conditions are satisfied
    -   If not specified, it defaults to `false`
-   Added new optional field: `shearing_sound` (sound event)
    -   It's a sound event that plays when the equippable item is sheared
    -   If not specified, it defaults to the `item.shears.snip` sound event

## Resource Pack Version 61

### UI Sprites

-   Added `icon/music_notes` and `toast/now_playing` sprites

Take aim for this snapshot! It's a bit smaller this week, and you might want to train a bit more to learn the new projectile mechanics! And while you are here, why not enjoy some misty peaks at a distance!

## Changes

-   Projectiles target tolerance margin now changes over time
-   Fog was tweaked for improved atmospheric perspective
-   It now becomes foggier when it rains
-   The test framework will no longer try to restart running tests after a server restart

### Projectile Targeting

-   Projectiles now have a target tolerance margin that changes over time
    -   Previously, all projectiles had a fixed 0.3 blocks target tolerance margin
    -   Now, all projectiles start with no margin for the first two ticks of their flight
    -   After that, the target margin will expand by 0.05 blocks per tick until it reaches the previous 0.3 blocks margin
    -   This allows for better precision close to the shooting player or entity, while still allowing for some collision leeway when the projectile is further away

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 76
-   `--quickPlaySingleplayer` command line argument can now be used without an identifier to launch into the last played world

## Data Pack Version 76

-   The scale attribute for the Happy Ghast now has a limit of `1.0`

### Entity Data

#### `tnt`

-   The entity that primed the TNT is now stored in an optional `owner` field (UUID of Living entity)

#### `vex`

-   The owner of a Vex is now stored in an optional `owner` field (UUID of Mob)

## Resource Pack Version 60

-   Panorama textures must now all be the same size, and square
-   Sounds for the Dried Ghast Block have been changed

### UI Sprites

-   The Mob Effect atlas has been removed, and sprites in the `textures/mob_effect/` folder are now included within the GUI atlas
    -   This means Mob Effect sprites now support GUI sprite scaling properties

### Shaders & Post-process Effects

#### Shader fog changes

-   The fog is now split into environmental and render-distance-based
-   Previously both those concepts were mixed in the same uniforms
-   Environmental fog is supposed to represent the "fogginess" of the environment the player is in: lava, water, and now also atmosphere
-   Render distance fog is supposed to obscure the border of visible terrain
-   Environmental fog uses spherical distance to determine its intensity, render distance fog uses cylindrical distance
-   The resulting fog value for any given vertex is the maximum of both

#### `Fog` Uniform Block

-   `FogStart` was renamed to `FogRenderDistanceStart` and now represents the render distance fog start
-   `FogEnd` was renamed to `FogRenderDistanceEnd` and now represents the render distance fog end
-   `FogEnvironmentalStart` is new and represents the start of environment-based fog
-   `FogEnvironmentalEnd` is new and represents the end of environment-based fog
-   `FogShape` was removed. Render distance fog is now cylindrical and environmental for is spherical

### Sound Events

-   `block.dried_ghast.hit` has been removed
