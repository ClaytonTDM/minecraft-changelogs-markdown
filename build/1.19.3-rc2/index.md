We're now releasing the second (and hopefully last) release candidate for Minecraft 1.19.3, fixing a few critical bugs. If there are no major issues following this release candidate, no further changes will be done before the full release.

With this release candidate, we are reverting a behavior change for translation strings due to a prevalent but unsupported use case. Expect this behavior to be changed in the future to provide a supported alternative.

Happy mining!
