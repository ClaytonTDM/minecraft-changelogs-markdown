# Minecraft 1.19 Pre-Release 2

A recent change made it possible for more types of mobs to spawn inside Nether Portals, which caused them to instantly change dimensions after spawning. We will not be making any further changes to this before the release of 1.19, but our intent for the future is to prevent most mobs from spawning in Nether Portals and the ones that do will not immediately travel through the portal. Expect to see these changes in a coming version.

## Changes in 1.19 Pre-release 2

â€‹

-   If the Warden is stuck in a liquid, it will angrily despawn instead of digging
-   Reverted using `generic equip` sound when equipping blocks in the head slot

# Minecraft 1.18.2 Pre-Release 1

We're now releasing the first pre-release for Minecraft 1.18.2. This pre-release introduces the possibility for data packs to customize cave generation and to add new custom structures to worlds.

If everything goes as expected, we aim to release this version on February 28th.

Happy mining!

## Changes in 1.18.2 Pre-release 1

-   Users running Minecraft in a 32-bit environment will receive a warning in the main menu about the upcoming end of 32-bit environment support

## Technical Changes in 1.18.2 Pre-release 1

-   The data pack version is now 9
-   It is now possible to add custom structures in experimental datapacks
-   `locate` and `locatebiome` commands now support tags (prefix with `#` to distinguish from normal ids)
-   The `locate` command parameter is now a configured structure rather than a structure type. For instance, you can now use `/locate village_desert` or `/locate shipwreck_beached`
-   A lot of the cave generation is now configurable through data packs

### Configurable caves

-   A new registry was added for Density functions (caves are created by combining those together)
-   Noise settings got a new field `noise_router` (and lost a couple of flags), see `worldgen/noise_settings` folder in the worldgen report
-   Noise router wires data-driven parts of the cave generation with the rest of the code

### Configured Structures and Structure Sets

The game now generates and stores data-driven configured structures.

-   Experimental datapacks can add new structure sets
-   The `feature` field in location predicates now references a configured feature
-   The `exploration_map` loot table function `destination` field is now a configured feature tag id
-   The `exploration_map` loot table function no longer automatically sets the display name of the map

#### Side effects

Some gameplay oddities have been affected by this change.

-   Dolphins will now more accurately pick the closest structure regardless of type
-   Bastion Remnant bounding boxes are now slightly more accurate to the shape of the structure

## Fixed bugs in 1.18.2 Pre-release 1

-   [MC-3524](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-3524) Structure related mobs do not spawn in flat type world generation
-   [MC-146854](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-146854) Player movement favors x axis when in a corner

-   [MC-210612](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-210612) Strongholds do not generate in certain customized worlds despite /locate saying otherwise
-   [MC-241288](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-241288) Support for custom structures has been removed
-   [MC-244137](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-244137) The option "level-seed" is not present in server.properties by default
-   [MC-248532](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-248532) Elytra firework particle spawns on the wrong hand when dual wielding fireworks
