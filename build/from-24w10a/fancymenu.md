# Minecraft Snapshot 24w10a

Woah, another snapshot day of the Wednesday variant! Today we are releasing 24w10a, featuring new Wolf Variants, some new Data Pack features, and lots of bug fixes.

Happy mining!

## New Features

-   Added variants of Wolves

### Wolf variants

-   New Wolf variants have been added
-   The variant is determined by the biome they spawn in
    -   Pale Wolf - The familiar Wolf variant that now spawns in the Taiga biome, with a default pack size of 4
    -   Woods Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Forest biome. This will be the dominant Wolf variant that you will be able to find in the Overworld, since the Forest biome is very common
    -   Ashen Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Snowy Taiga biome
    -   Black Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Old Growth Pine Taiga biome, in smaller packs of 2 to 4
    -   Chestnut Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Old Growth Spruce Taiga biome, in smaller packs of 2 to 4
    -   Rusty Wolf - A variant that spawns in a new location for wolves - the Sparse Jungle biome, in smaller packs of 2 to 4
    -   Spotted Wolf - A variant that spawns in a new location for wolves - the Savanna Plateau biome, in larger packs of 4 to 8
    -   Striped Wolf - A variant that spawns in a new location for wolves, the Wooded Badlands biome, in larger packs of 4 to 8
    -   Snowy Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Grove biome. A rare type, that always walks alone
-   Adjusted spawning conditions for Wolves, allowing them to spawn on Coarse Dirt and Podzol blocks

## Changes

-   Adjusted passive mobs spawning in Grove biome to only include Rabbits, Foxes and Wolves
-   Button tooltips will no longer appear when hovering outside the containing element

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 34

## Data Pack Version 34

-   Recipe results can now specify component data
-   Added new entity predicate field `slots`, for matching item slots
-   Added slot names for ranges, like `container.*`
-   Added `execute if|unless items` to check and count items
-   Banner Patterns are now data-driven
-   Changes to Item Stack Component formats
-   Player Head blocks now store a `custom_name` tag, which will be copied to and from the item form when broken or placed
-   The `SkullOwner` and `ExtraType` fields in Player Head blocks have been replaced with a `profile` field, with the same format as the item component
-   For now, the `count` field on Item Stacks is always stored again, even if `1`
    -   If the field is missing in data, will still fall back to `1`

### Recipes

-   Recipe types `crafting_shaped`, `crafting_shapeless`, `stonecutting` and `smithing_transform` now accept `components` for the `result` item stack
-   The `result` field for recipe types `smelting`, `blasting`, `smoking` and `campfire_cooking` is now an item stack format without a count, which means you'll need to specify an object with an `id` field
    -   This `result` now also accepts `components` data

### Predicates

#### `slots` entity sub-predicate

-   New entity field `slots` allows to check single or multiple slots on any entity
-   The field contains a map of slot names (same as ones used in `item` commands) to item predicate
-   For slot ranges, only one slot needs to match for whole entry to pass

Example:

    {
        "condition": "minecraft:entity_properties",
        "entity": "this",
        "predicate": {
            "slots": {
                "container.*": {
                    "items": "dirt"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    

### Slot names

-   Slot names (used in `item` commands and `slots` entity predicates) now include slot ranges
-   Unless specified, existing commands can still only work on single slots
-   New slot names:
    -   `container.*` - contains `container.0` to `container.53`
    -   `hotbar.*` - contains `hotbar.0` to `hotbar.8`
    -   `inventory.*` - contains `inventory.0` to `inventory.26`
    -   `enderchest.*` - contains `enderchest.0` to `enderchest.26`
    -   `villager.*` - contains `villager.0` to `villager.7`
    -   `horse.*` - contains `horse.0` to `horse.14`
    -   `weapon.*` - contains `weapon.mainhand` and `weapon.offhand`
    -   `armor.*` - contains `armor.head`, `armor.chest`, `armor.legs`, `armor.feed`, `armor.body`
    -   `player.cursor` - item held by player on screen
        -   Note: this information is not available in creative mode
    -   `player.crafting.0` - `player.crafting.3`, `player.crafting.*` - player's crafting slots
        -   Note: this includes only player's inventory crafting slots. Crafting table (or any other slots on other screens) are not included

#### `execute if|unless items`

-   `execute if|unless items <source> <slots> <item_predicate>` command can be used to count items
    -   `<source>` is the same as one used in `item` command, i.e.
        -   `block <x> <y> <z>`
        -   `entity <target>` (selector can return multiple entities)
    -   `<slots>` can accept single slot (like `container.0`) or a range (like `container.*`)
    -   `<item_predicate>` is the same as item predicate in `clear` command
-   If used alone, it will return total number of items in stacks that match predicates

### Banner Patterns

-   Banner Patterns will now be loaded into a dynamic registry from data packs (`data/<namespace>/banner_pattern/<id>`)
    -   These entries have two fields:
        -   `asset_id` (namespaced string) is used to resolve texture locations
            -   e.g. `custom:pattern` resolves to `assets/custom/textures/entity/banner/pattern.png`, `assets/custom/textures/entity/shield/pattern.png`
        -   `translation_key` (string) is a translation key prefix
            -   e.g. `block.minecraft.banner.custom.pattern` resolves to `block.minecraft.banner.custom.pattern.<dye color>`

### Item Stack Components

-   The `minecraft:profile` component no longer requires the `name` field to be present
-   Some additional Item Stack Components now support alternative, simple definitions:
    -   `minecraft:profile` can be defined as string player name (e.g. `profile="jeb_"`)
    -   `minecraft:dyed_color` can be defined as an integer rgb color (e.g. `dyed_color=16711680`)
    -   `minecraft:attribute_modifiers` can be defined as a direct list of modifiers (e.g. `attribute_modifiers=[{type:'generic.scale',uuid:[1,2,3,4],name:'Big!',amount:1.0,operation:'add_multiplied_base'}]`)
    -   `minecraft:potion_contents` can be defined as a single potion id (e.g. `potion_contents="invisibility"`)
    -   `minecraft:enchantments` and `minecraft:stored_enchantments` can be defined as an inline map of enchantment id to level (e.g. `enchantments={sharpness:1}`)
    -   These are only an alternative for defining the values, they will always be stored in their full formats
-   All container blocks now use the `minecraft:container` component when in item form, not just Shulker Boxes
-   The `minecraft:lodestone_target` component has been renamed to `minecraft:lodestone_tracker`
    -   The `pos` and `dimension` fields have been moved into a `target` object
    -   The `target` field is optional, and if not present, the compass will spin
-   The maximum number of lore and fireworks entries has been raised to 256

Hello! Here is a slightly bigger than usual snapshot with a lot of technical changes, refreshed UI, another iteration of Wolf Armor, and tweaks to new features.

Since the initial release of the Wolf Armor, we have been working on improving it to increase its protection, usability and add customization. For protection there is a new approach to armor, which considers the player's need to quickly see the state of the armor without using UI elements, and the ability to act quickly to help their pet wolf if needed. Please try it out and let us know what you think over at the feedback site: [Let's talk about Wolf Armor!](https://aka.ms/wolfarmorfeedback)

## Experimental Features

### Bogged

-   The Bogged drops 2 mushrooms (either both red/brown or one of each) when sheared
-   Updated Bogged texture and model

### Wind Charge

-   Removed randomness from the radius of both Breeze- and player-shot Wind Charges

### Vault

-   Additional changes to the Vault texture to even further distinguish from Trial Spawners

## Changes

-   Changes to Wolf Armor
-   The game's UI has been updated with a fresher look
-   Ctrl+Picking a renamed block (such as a Chest) in Creative Mode will now give a renamed item

### Wolf Armor

-   The Wolf Armor will protect the wolf from most damage sources until the armor loses all durability and breaks
-   Wolf Armor shows signs of increased breakage as durability goes down
-   Players can repair the Wolf Armor with Armadillo Scutes while it is equipped on the Wolf
-   Wolf armor can be dyed in similar fashion to Leather Armor
-   The Wolf's owner can now repair Wolf Armor on a Wolf

### UI

The UI has been updated to sport a fresher look and to be more consistent when it comes to the layout of different UI elements, all while retaining the essence and feel of the old screens.

As always, we're eager to hear your thoughts and opinions on further improvements or changes. Let us know what you think over at the [dedicated feedback site](https://aka.ms/JavaUIFeedback).

-   The menu background dirt texture has been replaced by a darkened background
    -   The dirt texture has been moved to the build-in Programmer Art Resource Pack
    -   Outside the game, the menu Panorama is displayed across all screen
    -   In the game, the world will be visible across all screens
    -   Paired with the darkened background is a blur
        -   The strength of the blur can be configured in Accessibility Settings
        -   In-game screens such as containers and books are not affected by these changes
-   Screen elements such as titles and buttons are positioned more consistently across different screens
-   The Player and World Backups screens in Realms have been updated
-   Lists now have clearer borders at the top and bottom
-   After defeating the Ender Dragon and entering the End Portal, the End Poem and credits are now displayed with a background based on the animated End Portal effect

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 33
-   The Resource Pack version is now 28
-   `playsound` command can now be used without specifying the player (assuming `@s`) and without specifying the mixer (assuming `master`)
-   In single player, when errors occur during loading or saving of chunks a warning will be shown in a toast
-   Trying join a single player world with less than 64 MB free disk space will show a warning screen
    -   Additionally, a warning toast will be shown periodically while in game

## Data Pack Version 33

-   Added `minecraft:bypasses_wolf_armor` for damage sources that can not be absorbed by Wolf Armor
-   Loot table entry with id `loot_table` now also accepts inline loot tables
-   Unstructured NBT data attached to stacks of items (`tag` field) has been replaced with structured 'components'

### Loot Tables

Loot table entry `loot_table` (which returns all items from provided nested loot table) now has the following syntax:

-   `value` - can be either:
    -   namespaced id - reference to another named loot table
    -   full loot table (same format as in standalone file)

### Item Stack Components

We are making some large changes to how Item Stack-specific properties are stored and represented in this snapshot, replacing the current NBT 'tag' with structured components.

This change has been made in order to:

-   Improve performance in cases where the game needs to frequently look up some property of an item (e.g. Armor Trims rendering every frame)
-   Validate item properties at load time, enabling easier identification of invalid data in commands and data packs
    -   This should avoid any 'silent' breakages in commands specifying custom item data for any potential future format changes
-   Continue to evolve the game to enable the creation of dynamic content

We understand that this is a significant breaking change for many datapacks and custom maps which will require significant effort to upgrade.

We do however believe that this builds critical foundations for future extensibility. We have taken care to ship these changes all at once, with the hope that this avoids future incremental changes requiring many small updates to packs.

The current NBT 'tag' has existed for quite some time, and we are aware that a lot of clever techniques have been developed with this for commands and data packs.

Although we have made our best effort to identify these cases, some of these techniques rely on undocumented or undefined behavior with certain tag configurations.

We want to ensure that no functionality is lost without a suitable alternative, but due to the undocumented nature of these techniques, we have very likely not caught everything!

We hope to address any regressions over the remaining course of this snapshot cycle.

With such a large change, we deeply value your feedback! You can share your thoughts on these changes over at the feedback site: [Let's talk about Item Stack Components!](https://aka.ms/ItemStackComponentsFeedback).

-   Unstructured NBT data attached to stacks of items (`tag` field) has been replaced with structured 'components'
    -   This data is parsed and validated when the item is loaded
    -   This should improve performance in certain scenarios (e.g. Armor Trim rendering) when item data was frequently compared or requested and parsed
    -   Custom data can still be stored in the `minecraft:custom_data` component
-   Item types (e.g. `minecraft:stick`) hold a set of default components on an item that individual item stacks can override
-   The format of serialized items and items in data packs has been updated for consistency and to support components
-   Item syntax in commands has been updated to support components
-   When advanced tooltips are enabled (F3+H), the number of components will be displayed instead of number of tags
-   Default component values for items are now listed in `items.json` generated in `reports` directory
-   The `ignoreTags` field on villager trades has been removed and replaced by a component predicate on damage
-   Block definitions are now added to `blocks.json` report (note: those definitions are not used yet and present only for informational purposes)
-   If the `key_item` field of Vault block is not present, the Vault cannot be unlocked

### Commands

-   Commands such as `/give`, `/item`, `/loot`, and `/clear` have updated item syntax
-   Components can now be specified after the item name in square brackets
    -   Components are assigned with an `=` (e.g. `wooden_pickaxe[damage=23]`)
    -   Components are comma-separated (e.g. `netherite_hoe[damage=5,repair_cost=2]`)
-   Component types will be autocompleted, but values themselves will not
-   Values will however be validated, and the command will fail to parse if the component is improperly specified
    -   e.g. `/give @s wooden_pickaxe[damage=-34]` is not valid
-   The pre-existing NBT syntax (`{...}`) is rewired to set or match the `minecraft:custom_data` component
    -   e.g. `/give @s stick{foo:'bar'}` is equivalent to `/give @s stick[custom_data={foo:'bar'}]`
    -   If both `[...]` and `{...}` are specified, `[...]` must be ordered before `{...}`
-   Item predicate arguments (in `/clear`) have new semantics with respect to matching components and custom data
    -   Every specified component must be present on the target item, and have an exactly equal parsed value
    -   Components with defaults (e.g. `damage=0` by default) will be assumed to exist on the target item if not specified
        -   As such, `/clear @s diamond_pickaxe[damage=0]` will match only undamaged Diamond Pickaxes
        -   On the other hand, `/clear @s diamond_pickaxe` will match any Diamond Pickaxe, irrespective of damage
    -   Exact matching of component values applies even for the `minecraft:custom_data` component
    -   However, using the `{...}` custom data syntax will use pre-existing NBT partial match behaviour
        -   This requires that all tags specified in the predicate are present on the target item, but additional ones may be ignored
        -   Lists in the target must contain all items specified in the predicate, but additional may be present and order is ignored
-   Modifier operations in the `/attribute` command have been renamed:
    -   `add` -> `add_value`
    -   `multiply_base` -> `add_multiplied_base`
    -   `multiply` -> `add_multiplied_total`

### Item Stack Format

-   Along with format changes due to components, the structures of item stacks on disk and in data packs have been updated for consistency
-   Previous `id` (string) and `Count` (byte) fields have been replaced with `id` (namespaced string) and `count` (integer) fields
    -   This format is additionally applied to the `icon` field in advancements, items in chat component hover events, and the `result` field in smelting recipes (`result` and `count` are no longer inlined)
-   The `count` field is optional (defaults to `1`), and no longer stored if default
    -   Stack size is now limited to the maximum stack size of the item
-   The `tag` field has been removed, and any remaining contents will end up in the `minecraft:custom_data` component when upgrading
-   A new `components` field stores all components attached to an item
    -   Format: map of component id to component value (varies by component id)
        -   e.g. `{..., components: {'minecraft:damage': 12}}`
        -   Components with a `!` prefix (e.g. `"!minecraft:damage": {}`) will cause this component to be removed
    -   Components equal to their default value will not be stored
-   The item stack format no longer represents empty stacks (`air` item, or `count` 0)
    -   Instead, in places that support it, the field should be ommitted
    -   In some cases, such as lists of stacks (e.g. `HandItems` in living entities), an empty map (`{}`) is used to represent empty stacks

### Other Format Changes

-   Tipped Arrows no longer store their applied potion effects
    -   This is instead fetched from their held `item`
-   Area Effect Clouds now store potions in the same format as the `minecraft:potion_contents` component in a `potion_contents` field:
    -   `Potion` -> `potion_contents.potion`
    -   `Color` -> `potion_contents.custom_color`
    -   `effects` -> `potion_contents.custom_effects`
-   Banners now store applied patterns in the same format as the `minecraft:banner_patterns` component in a `patterns` field:
    -   `Patterns[].Pattern` (string short id) -> `patterns[].pattern` (string pattern registry id)
    -   `Patterns[].Color` (integer dye id) -> `patterns[].color` (string dye name)
-   Beehive format has also been updated:
    -   `Bees[].EntityData` -> `bees[].entity_data`
    -   `Bees[].TicksInHive` -> `bees[].ticks_in_hive`
    -   `Bees[].MinOccupationTicks` -> `bees[].min_ticks_in_hive`
    -   `FlowerPos` -> `flower_pos`
-   Villager Trades can be configured to accept only undamaged items by selecting for `'minecraft:damage': 0`
    -   By default, if no components are specified, any item will be accepted (similar to `components` field in item predicates)

### Loot Item Functions

-   Added `minecraft:set_components` function
    -   Adds or replaces the given component on the input item
    -   `conditions`: list of conditions (default: `[]`):
        -   Conditions to check before applying the function
    -   `components`: map of component id to component value (format varied by id)
        -   Components with a `!` prefix (e.g. `"!minecraft:damage": {}`) will cause this component to be removed
-   Added `minecraft:copy_components` function
    -   Copies components from a specified source onto an item
    -   This is now used in the Vanilla pack in place of the `minecraft:copy_name` and `minecraft:copy_nbt` functions
    -   `conditions`: list of conditions (default: `[]`):
        -   Conditions to check before applying the function

    -   These now apply to the `minecraft:custom_data` component of the target item
-   `minecraft:set_attributes` function has been updated
    -   The modifier `slot` field now supports `any`, `armor`, and `hand` values
    -   The modifier `operation` values have been renamed:
        -   `addition` -> `add_value`
        -   `multiply_base` -> `add_multiplied_base`
        -   `multiply_total` -> `add_multiplied_total`

### Predicate Formats in Loot Tables & Advancements

-   Item predicate format has been updated:

Poof! Here's snapshot 24w06a with the new experimental Wind Charge item and optimizations for Hoppers... among other changes!

We'd love to get your feedback on the new Wind Charge feature over at the official feedback site: [Let's talk about Wind Charges!](https://aka.ms/mcwindchargefeedback)

We've also made a change so that a hopper will no longer try to pick up item entities if there is a full block placed above it. This will improve performance for many redstone builds, but will break some machines that relied on glitching items into a block above a hopper.

Happy parkouring!

## Experimental Features

### Wind Charge

-   Become the Breeze! Using a Wind Charge will fire off a wind charge projectile similar to the Breeze's
-   A Wind Charge fired by a player will grant 10% more knockback than a Breeze's, but have a much smaller area of impact
-   Just like the projectile fired by the Breeze, Wind Charges fired by the player also deal damage if they hit an entity directly
-   The Breeze drops between 4-6 Wind Charges when killed
-   There is a half-second cooldown after each use
-   Wind Charges can be fired from a dispenser
-   Players that launch themselves with a wind charge only accumulate fall damage below the y-level of where they collided with the wind burst

### Vault

-   Tweaked the texture of Vaults to make them easier to distinguish from Trial Spawners

## Changes

-   Final tweaks to Armadillo
-   Updates to Tamed Wolves health and damage
-   Added option to use Japanese variants of CJK characters
-   Hoppers will no longer try to pick up item entities if there is a full block placed above it

### Armadillo

-   Armadillos do not panic when damaged but roll up instead, and hide their head and feet
-   Armadillos peek out to see if “the coast is clear” before unrolling
-   New animations and sounds for rolling up and unrolling + the peek out animation

With these changes the Armadillo work is done for now, and we are switching our attention to the Wolf Armor instead.

### Tamed Wolves health and damage

-   Tamed Wolves now have 40 health points (20 hearts) instead of 20 health points (10 hearts)
-   They no longer take half of the damage from most environmental sources like they used to do
    -   In most cases this change will make no difference given the health boost, but now they can withstand more damage from players and arrows
-   Feeding a Wolf now heals twice as many health points

### Japanese font variants

-   New option has been added to select Japanese variants for some CJK characters
-   Replacement glyphs come from Japanese version of Unifont font
-   New option is included in new "Font Settings" menu, accessible from "Language" menu
-   Default value of this option is based on system locale language setting
-   "Force Unicode" button has been moved to "Font Settings"

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 31
-   The Resource Pack version is now 26
-   Improved hopper performance
-   Added JFR (Java Flight Recorder) events for individual chunk reads (`minecraft.ChunkRegionRead`) and writes (`minecraft.ChunkRegionWrite`)
-   Maximum length of a command in a function (including macro expansions) can no longer exceed 2,000,000 characters
-   Reduced amount of data sent by the server during login by reusing parts of the vanilla datapack

## Data Pack Version 31

-   Potion effect amplifiers are restricted between 0 and 255 again
    -   The former behavior of effects such as Jump Boost, Levitation, and Mining Fatigue over 127 has been replaced with new attributes
-   Added `generic.gravity` attribute that controls blocks/tick^2 acceleration downward
-   Added `generic.safe_fall_distance` attribute to control the fall distance after which the entity will take fall damage
-   Added `generic.fall_damage_multiplier` attribute to multiply overall fall damage amount
-   Renamed `horse.jump_strength` to `generic.jump_strength`, and now applies to all entities
    -   This controls the base impulse from a jump (before jump boost or modifier on block)
-   Added `player.block_break_speed` attribute that acts as a multiplier over block breaking speed for players
-   All block positions are now stored as an array of 3 integers instead of a map of `X`, `Y`, and `Z`
-   `FlowerPos` and `HivePos` in Bees have been renamed to `flower_pos` and `hive_pos`
-   `FlowerPos` in Beehives has been renamed to `flower_pos`
-   `BeamTarget` in End Crystals has been renamed to `beam_target`
-   `Leash` in all leashable entities has been renamed to `leash`
-   `PatrolTarget` in patrolling mobs has been renamed to `patrol_target`
-   `ExitPortal` in End Gateways has been renamed to `exit_portal`
-   `WanderTarget` in Wandering Traders has been renamed to `wander_target`

### Tags

#### Block Tags:

-   Added 'minecraft:blocks;;_;;wind;;_;;charge;;_;;explosions' for blocks not impacted by the explosion when hit by Wind Charge.

## Resource Pack Version 26

-   Added font variant filters to font providers

### Font variant filters

-   Every glyph provider can now be enabled or disabled based on certain set of variants
-   Available variants are currently hardcoded and controlled by font options menu
    -   Current variants:
        -   `uniform` - wired to "Force Uniform" button
        -   `jp` - wired to "Japanese Glyph Variants" button
-   Filters are defined in section called `filter`, available for every glyph provider
    -   Keys in that object are variant names (for example `uniform`)
    -   Glyph provider will be included only when value in filter matches actual value of variant in key
