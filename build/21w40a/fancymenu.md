**We still highly recommend backing up your world before loading it in this snapshot.**

## Changes in 21w40a

-   World generation tweaks
-   Changes to mob spawning
-   Copper Ore now drops 2-5 (from 2-3) Raw Copper items
-   In the Stonecutter, a Block of Copper can be converted to four Cut Copper
-   A bunch of biome variant with similar features but different shapes have been merged into one, since the shape is controlled independently now
-   Renamed some biomes

### World Generation

-   Updated ore distribution to make branch mining deep down more rewarding. [Updated ore distribution chart](TODO)
    -   For example, added more unexposed diamonds
    -   Iron ore now generates above 80, with more iron ore as you go higher
    -   Extra gold generates below height -48
-   Non-cave biomes no longer change with height - so no more savannas in the sky and things like that
-   Tweaked the relative size of some biomes to match 1.17 a bit closer.
-   Increased the average size of most biomes (this also means biomes aren't in the same places as before)
-   Fixed some aquifer issues (a side effect of this is that aquifers are in different places now compared to last snapshot)
-   Slightly increased the frequency of underwater magma
-   Increased the amount of dungeons, especially below height 0
-   Gravel now generates below height 0
-   Villages are slightly more spread out
-   Removed water lake features, Aquifers provide local water levels

### Mob Spawns

-   Axolotls now only spawn in water, above clay blocks, in lush caves
-   Glowsquids now only spawn in water blocks, under height 30
-   Cod, Salmon, Pufferfish, Tropical Fish, Squid and Dolphins now only spawn in water from height 50 to height 64
-   Tropical Fish now also spawn in lush caves at any height
-   Zombies once again spawn in dripstone caves - drowned can also spawn there however
-   Goats no longer spawn in stony peaks

## Technical Changes in 21w40a

-   Optimized AI for Axolotls, Goats, Hoglins, Zoglins, Piglins, Piglin Brutes and Villagers
-   Bedrock layers generate dependent on the world seed now
