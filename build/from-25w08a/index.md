# Minecraft Snapshot 25w08a

We're adding some new, fun and cute features in this week's snapshot. Spawn eggs just got cuter with new textures looking more like the mobs they spawn. Wolves are becoming even more unique with their own individual sounds. When a wolf spawns, it will get one of seven personalities, unrelated to their variant or biome. From cute to grumpy, each wolf will bark, growl, pant, whine, and express themselves in their own unique way. To top it all off, leaf litter will now look even better with new colors and we have made some tweaks to what color of sheep spawns in different biomes.

Have fun exploring!

## New Features

-   Added new sound variants for Wolves
-   Overhauled the visuals of each Spawn Egg to improve readability and accessibility

### Farm Animal variants

#### Sheep wool color in warm and cold biomes

-   Reverted the change from last week that allowed Blue, Light Blue, Cyan, Yellow, Orange and Red Sheep to spawn naturally in different biomes

-   Pink Sheep will still be very rare and able to spawn anywhere where Sheep can spawn

### Leaf Litter

### Spawn Egg visuals overhaul

-   Each Spawn Egg now has their own unique visual which captures the personality and character of the mob it spawns
-   Each egg visual varies in shape to reflect the in-world size of the mob it spawns
    -   For example, smaller mobs tend to have a smaller Spawn Egg

### Wolf Sounds Variants

-   Added 6 new Wolf sound variants with unique ambient, hurt, death, growl, whine, and pant sounds
    -   The new sounds are part of variants that are called `big`, `cute`, `puglin`, `angry`, `grumpy` and `sad`
    -   The original Wolf sounds now are used for the variant called `classic`
    -   Every Wolf will have a random sound variant assigned to it from the 6 new variants and the original one
    -   The sound variant is not related to the texture variant

Frogday on a Thursday, who thinks of that?! In this week's snapshot we are updating trades for wandering traders and cartographers. We have also introduced new, biome-based spawn rules for sheep. It's time to go out and explore the world! Mojang's bug-tracker Mojira is migrating to the cloud and during the process bug reporting is unavailable. The new platform will soon be up and running, ready for players to log in, create accounts, and most importantly â€“ report bugs! During the downtime, try to keep the bug alive and report it once Mojira is back!

![Cartographers now sell maps to structures in different biomes (villages in Desert, Plains, Savanna, Snowy Plains or Taiga, the Swamp Hut in a Swamp or the Jungle Temple in a Jungle). Cartographers in different biomes will have a different selection of these maps, available at Apprentice level. The previously existing maps to Trial Chambers and Ocean Monuments are available at Journeyman level. Colored banners are sold at Expert level and the range is different in different biomes. A Woodland Mansion map is guaranteed at Master level along with the globe banner pattern.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/25w07acartographertrades.jpg)

### Shaders & Post-process Effects

> **Developer's Note**: _Although it is possible in Resource Packs, overriding Core Shaders is considered as unsupported and not an intended Resource Pack feature. These shaders exist as part of the internal implementation of the game, and as such, may change at any time as the game's internals evolve. We understand that overriding Core Shaders is used for very cool Resource Pack features, many of which lack supported alternatives. We would like to provide better, supported alternatives in the future._

-   Shader program definitions for core shaders and post-processing effects as JSON files have been removed
-   The shader programs themselves are still available and can be overridden
-   The post-processing effects are still configurable as JSON

#### Post-process Effect Definitions

-   The field `program` was replaced with `vertex_shader` and `fragment_shader`
    -   `<namespace>:<path>` will resolve to `assets/<namespace>/shaders/<path>.<vsh|fsh>`
-   `type` is now a required field for each `uniform`
    -   Possible values are currently `int`, `ivec3`, `float`, `vec2`, `vec3`, `vec4`, `matrix4`
-   `values` in each `uniform` is now optional
    -   Leaving it unset is not recommended and is used for runtime configuration of the blur effect
-   Leaving a uniform unspecified results in undefined behavior, you must specify each one that will be used by the shaders

### Item rendering

#### Item Display

-   `firstperson_lefthand` and `thirdperson_lefthand` transforms are now rendered the same as when held in hand

#### Item Entity

-   When on ground, model size is now taken into account when determining hovering motion
    -   That means that models should never clip into the block below, no matter what size they are
-   Positioning of items in an item stack on ground now depends on model size and model type
    -   If model depth (Z coordinate) is below 1/16th of a block, item is rendered as flat stack of items
    -   Otherwise model is rendered as a cluster of items offset in all directions around center
    -   Previously, flat stack rendering happened only for models with `builtin/generated` parent

This week we have been contemplating existential questions like "What came first; the cold chicken or the blue egg?". It's time for the cold chicken and the warm chicken to make their way into snapshot 25w06a together with their respective colorful egg. In addition, pink cactus flowers and dry grass will now decorate deserts and badlands.

## New Features

-   Added Warm and Cold Chicken variants
-   Added Short Dry Grass and Tall Dry Grass
-   Added Cactus Flower block which can grow on Cactus blocks

### Farm Animal variants

-   Warm and cold variants have been added for Chicken
-   Existing Chicken variant has been renamed to temperate
-   The variant is determined by the biome they spawn in
-   Warm and cold biomes are the same for all animals with variants (i.e. Chicken, Pig, Cow)
-   Two new Egg items have been added for the warm and cold Chicken variants
    -   Blue Egg - The Egg that is laid by and can hatch cold Chicken variant
    -   Brown Egg - The Egg that is laid by and can hatch warm Chicken variant
-   Already existing Egg is laid by and can hatch temperate Chicken variant

### Short and Tall Dry Grass

-   Added two new types of grass: Short Dry Grass and Tall Dry Grass
-   Both are one block high, which makes Tall Dry Grass differ from Tall Grass which is two blocks high
-   Both generate in the Desert and Badlands
-   Both can be placed on types of Sand, Terracotta and Dirt blocks like the Dead Bush
-   Both can be bone mealed
    -   Using Bone Meal on Short Dry Grass grows it into a Tall Dry Grass
    -   Using Bone Meal on Tall Dry Grass places a neighbouring Short Dry Grass next to the block if possible
-   Both can be used in the Composter
-   Sheep can eat both to regrow its wool
-   Both can be used as fuel for smelting

### Cactus Flower

-   Cactus Flower is a new type of flower which has a chance of generating on cactuses in Deserts and Badlands

-   Cactus Flowers have a chance of growing on Cactus blocks
    -   If a Cactus is one or two blocks high the Cactus Flower has a 10% chance to grow instead of the Cactus getting higher
    -   If a Cactus is three blocks or higher the Cactus Flower has a 25% chance to grow
    -   Cactus Flowers will only grow if they have space on all four sides
-   Cactus Flowers can be used in the Composter
-   A Cactus Flower can be used to craft 1 Pink Dye

## Changes

-   Any block in the simulation distance of a player or loaded by another source of chunk loading (such as Ender Pearls) may now receive random ticks, instead of just 8 chunks around players
    -   For example: if a chunk is loaded by an Ender Pearl or is in the spawn chunks, crops are able to grow, Ice can melt, Snow can fall, and a Cauldron can be filled by rain
    -   Mob spawning, Lava spreading fire, and Lightning strikes still occur in the previous radius of 8 chunks around players
-   Fire will no longer burn or spread if no player is within 8 chunks
-   Tooltips for Fireworks and Crossbows now show a compact form of multiple repeated stars or projectiles that are identical

### Firefly Bush

-   This feature is experimental
-   Fields in file:
    -   `model` - one of: `normal`, `cold`
    -   `asset_id` - namespaced id for this variant asset, resolves to `assets/<namespace>/textures/<path>.png`
    -   `spawn_conditions` - field described in uniform variant selection above

## Resource Pack Version 51
