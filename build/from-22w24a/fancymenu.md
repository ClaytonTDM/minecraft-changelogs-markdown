# Minecraft Snapshot 22w24a

New snapshot! We're now heading towards 1.19.1, which will add Allay duplication, the ability to report chat, and, of course, fix a few bugs.

On the topic of chat reporting, we want everyone to feel safe and welcome in Minecraft, which is why we have community guidelines in place. If you feel unsafe, uncomfortable, or concerned that someone is breaking our [Community Guidelines](https://www.minecraft.net/community-standards) or the [Xbox Community Standards](https://www.xbox.com/legal/community-standards), you can soon report this in-game. Of course, it will also be possible to report incidents over at the [Report a Concern](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=4416074743565) page.

We are looking for feedback regarding the Chat Reporting feature. For now, any reports made during the testing period may not be actioned on.

Enjoy!

## New Features in 22w24a

-   Added Allay duplication
-   Added Player Chat Reporting

### Allay

-   Allays will dance to a Record playing in a Jukebox
-   If the Allay is handed an Amethyst Shard while dancing it will duplicate
    -   Duplication has a 2.5 minute cooldown

### Player Chat Reporting

It is now possible to report a player for sending abusive messages in the game chat.

A reporter is required to select the individual chat messages that contain the objectionable content, as well as the category of the report, this is to provide the best context for our moderation team to take action.

Accessed via the social interactions screen (default keybind is P).

-   The social interactions screen is now available via the Pause screen when in a multiplayer game
-   Multiple chat messages can be selected for reporting
-   The category of the chat report can be selected from a list of Chat Report Categories
-   Additional comments can be entered to provide more details and information regarding the report

# Minecraft 1.19 Pre-Release 2

A recent change made it possible for more types of mobs to spawn inside Nether Portals, which caused them to instantly change dimensions after spawning. We will not be making any further changes to this before the release of 1.19, but our intent for the future is to prevent most mobs from spawning in Nether Portals and the ones that do will not immediately travel through the portal. Expect to see these changes in a coming version.

## Changes in 1.19 Pre-release 2

​

-   If the Warden is stuck in a liquid, it will angrily despawn instead of digging
-   Reverted using `generic equip` sound when equipping blocks in the head slot

# Minecraft Snapshot 22w19a

Thursday snapshot! Apart from some bugfixes and some changes to fancy tags and commands, we're introducing "chat preview" as a way to cryptographically sign chat messages that have been dynamically styled by servers. And for this snapshot only, we've left in our testing option `test-rainbow-chat` in `server.properties`, which can be set to true together with the new `previews-chat` option for testing. If this is something that interests you, and especially if you run a server, we would love your feedback on it.

Enjoy!

## Changes in 22w19a

-   Warden and Iron Golems now make sure to spawn above something solid

## Technical Changes in 22w19a

-   Servers can now enable Chat Preview, which displays a server-controlled preview above the chat edit box
-   Changes to the locate and place commands
-   Point of Interest tags

### Chat Preview

-   Servers can enable Chat Preview by setting `previews-chat=true` in `server.properties`
-   When enabled, a server-controlled preview appears above the chat edit box, showing how the message will look when sent
-   This can be used by servers to preview messages with styling applied, such as emojis or chat coloring
-   Chat Preview sends chat messages to the server as they are typed, even before they're sent
    -   The server then sends back the styled preview in real time
    -   This allows servers to apply dynamic message stylings while still allowing chat to be securely signed
-   A warning screen is shown on the client when joining a server with Chat Preview, and it can be globally disabled in Chat Settings
-   Dynamic chat styling can also be controlled by the server, although this is only signed when Chat Preview is enabled
    -   Clients can prefer to always show the original, signed message by enabling "Only Show Signed Chat" in Chat Settings

### Commands

-   Added template sub-command to `place`;;-;;command
-   `locate` command moved to `locate structure`, `locatebiome` moved to `locate biome`
-   Added `locate poi <type: point_of_interest_type>`
-   Servers will now also send an additional icon and MOTD packet after a player has connected
    -   This allows servers with `enable-status=false` to set an icon and MOTD for players that successfully connect

**Place template**

The `place`;;-;;command can now also place templates at a given location. Syntax: `place template <template> [pos] [rotation] [mirror] [integrity] [seed]`

-   `place template` works like using the load button in the UI for a structure block

Parameters:

-   `template`: The namespaced id of a template ("structure block file") to load and place
-   `rotation`: The rotation to apply (if omitted, `none` is used)
-   `mirror`: The mirroring to apply (if omitted, `none` is used)
-   `integrity`: The structure integrity value between 0 and 1
-   `seed`: The seed to use for the randomized degradation when integrity is less than 1

### Point of Interest types

-   Removed `unemployed` and `nitwit` `point_of_interest_type`s
-   Added tag `point_of_interest_type/acquirable_job_site` for all job sites seeked by Villagers with `none` profession
-   Added tag `point_of_interest_type/village` for PoI that are part of Village
-   Added tag `point_of_interest_type/bee_home` for all PoI targeted by Bees
