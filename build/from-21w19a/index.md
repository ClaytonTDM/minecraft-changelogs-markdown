# Minecraft Snapshot 21w19a

Now with twice as much Java version.

Starting with this snapshot, Candles, Bundles, and Sculk Sensors are only accessible through commands. We do not feel that they are at the quality we want for Part 1 of the Caves & Cliffs release. To keep trying these features out in survival mode, use the Preview data pack!

## Changes in 21w19a

-   The maximum length of item names in the anvil UI has been increased from 35 to 50
-   Made geodes significantly rarer
-   Unfinished items (Sculk Sensor, Bundle and Candles) have been removed from the creative inventory
-   Recipes for unfinished items (Bundle, Candles) have been removed

## Changes to the Caves & Cliffs Preview

Download the [updated datapack](https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/a6b56d6f14869646eb8d399e99a0149bdd954490/CavesAndCliffsPreview.zip).

-   The pack now includes recipes related to bundles and candles

## Technical changes in 21w19a

-   Upgraded to Java 16
-   Added `mineable/axe`, `mineable/hoe`, `mineable/pickaxe` and `mineable/shovel` block tags. Blocks with these tags can be destroyed more quickly with the matching tool.
-   Added `needs_stone_tool`, `needs_iron_tool` and `needs_diamond_tool` block tags. If a block requires the correct tool to drop, these tags determine which tier of that tool is required.
-   Changed the syntax of the `/item` command

### Java 16

Minecraft now uses a more recent version of Java. If you are using a default setup the Launcher will download and install the correct version. If you are using a custom Java setup or a third-party launcher, you will need to ensure that your Java installation is version 16 or above.

### Item command

New syntax:

-   `/item replace <target> with <item stack> [<count>]` - same as old `replaceitem`
-   `/item replace <target> from <source> [<modifier>]` - copies item for source to target(s), optionally applying modifier
-   `/item modify <target> <modifier>` - modifies item (without copying)

For example, `/item replace block ~ ~ ~ container.0 from entity @s enderchest.0` will copy first item from player's enderchest to first slot of container player is currently standing on.

Hey-hoo! Will you look at that! It's Wednesday once again, which means we get to share updates about all the Minecraft bits and bobs. This week, we're distributing an ore distribution Snapshot for all you lovely Snapshot connoisseurs to feast upon. Enjoy!

## Changes in 21w18a

-   Infested Blocks are no longer instantly destroyed, and instead have half the destroy time of their non-infested counterpart.
-   Screaming goats will use their ram attack more often than other goats will

-   Reduced copper spawning a bit, to compensate for large ore veins
-   Large ore veins are slightly more rare and slightly smaller on average. But the size varies a lot so you can still find huge ones.
-   Increased chance of finding raw ore blocks in ore veins
-   Cave carvers generate below y 0 in ocean biomes (they didn't before, it was an accident)
-   Increased the minimum size of noodle caves and carvers, to make them easier to traverse and less likely to break up into fragments.
-   Noodle caves no longer generate above y 30, so the surface should be less riddled with holes.
-   Removed deepslate blobs above y 0
-   Extended the vertical range of the smaller blobs of iron ore, to make it possible to find iron in caves near the surface.
-   Slightly reduced the amount of normal-sized iron blobs, to compensate for large ore veins and the increased range of smaller blobs.

-   Large Ore Veins have been tweaked
-   Added thinner, squigglier, and more claustrophobic variant of spaghetti caves

### Large Ore Veins

Snapshot 21w16a introduces some changes to azaleas and dripstone. On top of that, we've tweaked the textures of raw ores. There are also a few additions to the Caves & Cliffs preview datapack.

## New Features in 21w16a

-   Azalea and Flowering Azalea can now be bonemealed to get an Azalea Trees
-   Added dripstone growth

### Dripstone growth

-   If a stalactite is hanging from a dripstone block with a water source above, it will slowly grow both the stalactite from above and a stalagmite from below
-   Growth speed is random but very slow, a single growth step can take several minecraft days
-   A stalactite will only grow up to 7 blocks long
-   A stalactite will only cause stalagmite growth if the floor or stalagmite below is within 10 blocks
-   If the stalactite tip is inside water it won't drip, and therefore won't trigger any growth
-   If the stalagmite tip is inside water it won't receive drops, and therefore won't be grown by a dripping stalactite. Same thing if there is any fluid between the two tips
-   A stalagmite or stalactite will never grow into a fluid

## Changes in 21w16a

-   Tweaked the texture of raw ores and raw ore blocks

-   Aquifers below height 0 will sometimes be lava aquifers instead of water aquifers
-   Ore veins can now spawn underground

### Ore veins

-   Ore veins are large, rare, snake-like underground ore formations
-   Copper veins form above height 0 and are mixed with granite
-   Iron veins form below height 0 and are mixed with tuff

## Technical Changes in 21w16a

-   Users who previously permanently declined server resource packs will now still be shown the pack prompt if the pack is mandatory (instead of being immediately disconnected)
-   The statistic for play time has been renamed to `play_time`
-   There is now a statistic for "Time with World Open" (`total_world_time`) that also includes time when the game was paused
