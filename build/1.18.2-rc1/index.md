We’re now releasing the first (and hopefully only) release candidate for Minecraft 1.18.2. This release candidate fixes two world generation bugs that could cause a server to stop running. If there are no major issues following this release, no further changes will be done before the full release, which is planned for February 28th. ​ Happy mining!

# Fixed Bugs in 1.18.2 Release Candidate 1

-   [MC-244682](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-244682) Some custom dimensions settings can cause the server to stop running, but not crash
-   [MC-248764](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-248764) Some worldgen datapacks can kill the internal server (possibly related to density functions)
