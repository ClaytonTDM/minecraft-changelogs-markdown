-   The hydration level is not preserved when mined
-   Makes sounds and shows particles depending on its hydration level
-   The Dried Ghast block emits a vibration frequency of 11 when its block state changes

#### Ghastling Mob

-   The Ghastling is a young version of the Happy Ghast mob
-   Spawns from a Dried Ghast block that has continuously been waterlogged for about 20 minutes
-   After spawning, the Ghastling will try and follow:
    -   Players within a 16-block radius or
    -   An adult, non-aquatic passive mob or some of the neutral mobs within a 16-block radius
-   If no player or suitable mob is close around, the Ghastling will idle around within 32 blocks from its home position where it spawned or was last interacted with
    -   It will reset its home position if it is moved more than 16 blocks away from the border of its home position
-   Can be tempted and fed using Snowballs
-   Will grow up into a Happy Ghast after about 20 minutes, or faster if fed Snowballs

#### Happy Ghast Mob

-   Can be equipped with a Harness and then be mounted by up to four players
-   Tempted by Snowballs and Harness
    -   The Happy Ghast can only be tempted with a Harness when it has no harness equipped
-   Slowly regenerates health, with regeneration speeding up during rain, snow or when flying at the same height as clouds
-   The first player that mounts the Happy Ghast will control it, sitting above it in the front seat
    -   When controlled, the goggles of the Happy Ghast flip down to cover its eyes
-   Players mounting after the first player are placed in slots on each side of it, starting clockwise from the first player
-   Pressing the sneak key dismounts the player on top of the Happy Ghast
-   If the Happy Ghast detects players standing on top of it, it ceases all movement and rotates to the closest cardinal direction
    -   This happens regardless of whether it has a Harness equipped or not
-   When mounted on the Happy Ghast, the third-person camera is further away from the player
-   When there are no players mounted or walking on the Happy Ghast, it starts its roaming behavior
    -   If players dismount midair, the Happy Ghast will descend towards the ground before it starts roaming
    -   The roaming behavior is similar to the Ghastling, except for the radius being 64 blocks
    -   When wearing a Harness, the Happy Ghast roams closer to the home position, within a 32 block radius
    -   When leashed, the Happy Ghast has a roaming distance of 10 blocks
    -   The Happy Ghast will try to stay close to blocks when roaming
-   Cannot be bred
-   Cannot enter boats
-   Has no panic behavior when taking damage

### Locator Bar

The Locator Bar is a new UI element that displays the direction of other players in the world.

-   If another player is in the world (and that player is not hiding) the Locator Bar will display in the same area as experience bar
    -   When experience is gained the experience bar will appear
    -   If there are no other players in the world the experience bar will display as normal
-   Facing other players within a 120 degree range will display those players as colored indicators on the Locator Bar
    -   Other players that are above/below the screen will also display an up/down arrow together with their indicator
    -   The indicator will change to different sized icons depending on how far away the other Player is
    -   Colored indicators are randomized for each player
        -   Operators can modify the colors of indicators with the `/waypoint` command
            -   e.g.: `/waypoint modify @s color red` to set an indicator to red
        -   Players on a team will override their default indicator color with their team color
-   Players can hide by crouching, wearing a mob head or a Carved Pumpkin, or using a Potion of Invisibility
-   Players in Spectator Mode are not visible on the Locator Bar
    -   However, spectators are visible to each other
-   The Locator Bar can be toggled off by setting the `locatorBar` game rule to `false`

### Projectile Targeting

-   The target tolerance margin of projectiles now changes over time
    -   Previously, all projectiles had a target tolerance margin of 0.3 blocks
    -   Now, all projectiles start with no margin for the first two ticks of their flight
    -   After that, the target margin will expand by 0.05 blocks per tick until it reaches the previous 0.3 blocks margin
    -   This allows for better precision close to the shooting player or entity, while still allowing for some collision leeway when the projectile is further away

### Splash Potions

-   Splash Potions distance to affected entities now depends on the closest distance between the entity hitbox and the splash potion hitbox where it landed
    -   This means that if an entity is hit directly by the splash potion, it will receive the full effect of the potion
    -   If the entities are grouped together, they will receive the same effect strength

## Technical Changes

Prints the current version information on the server side.

-   Takes no arguments
-   Available in singleplayer or for server operators

#### Added `datapack create`

Creates a new empty directory data pack for the current world.

-   The supported pack version is always equal to one supported by the game
-   Available only to server owners
-   Syntax: `datapack create <id> <name>`
    -   `id` - new pack name, must be a valid directory name
    -   `name` - text component to be placed in `description` in `pack.mcmeta`

#### Modified `playsound`

-   Added new category `ui`
    -   Sounds in this category will continue playing when paused, similarly to `music`

#### Added `waypoint`

This is a new command for querying and modifying waypoints.

    waypoint list
    
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> color <color>
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> color hex <hex-color>
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> color reset
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> style <waypoint_style/resource>
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> style reset
    

Arguments:

-   `entity-selector`: For selecting entities that are transmitting as waypoints (see `waypoint_transmit_range` attribute)
-   `color`: Overrides the Locator Bar icon color for this waypoint
-   `hex <hex-color>` arguments are in web format (RRGGBB)
    -   Red is either `hex F00` or `hex FF0000`
    -   Cornflower blue is `hex 6495ED`
-   `style`: For changing the icon spriteset and selection distances
    -   `set <waypoint_style/resource>` changes the style to a specific asset under `waypoint_style/` (see Waypoint Styles section below)
    -   `reset` will restore the default icon behavior of the Locator Bar

### Waypoint Broadcasting

The Locator Bar works through a server-controlled Waypoint system. Waypoints are received by Players, and connections between Waypoints and Players are managed by the multiplayer server.

-   By default, all Players transmit a Waypoint from themselves, and all Players receive all Waypoints
-   Individual Players can have their transmission and receive ranges controlled by the `waypoint_transmit_range` and `waypoint_receive_range` attributes

### Dialogs

-   Added a way to display simple modal dialogs to a user
-   Dialogs are stored in a `minecraft:dialog` registry, but can also be defined inline
-   Dialogs are an experimental feature
-   To avoid user confusion, dialog screens are marked with a warning sign next to the title
    -   Clicking on this warning leads to a screen that explains to user that this screen is provided by custom content
    -   It also gives the user an option to leave the current world to avoid them being locked in an infinite loop of dialogs
    -   If a new dialog is received by the client while warning screen is visible, it will not replace it, but when user clicks the "Back" button, the new dialog will be restored instead
-   Dialogs can be displayed by server in `play` and `configuration` connection phases
    -   However, only inline registries are allowed in `configuration`, since registries are not yet available in that phase
    -   Additionally, `run_command` click event is not available in `configuration` phase
-   Dialogs by default will close after the Escape key is pressed
    -   When this happens, dialog will run action specific to dialog type described as "exit action" below
    -   This behavior is configurable
-   When the dialog screen is closed, the game goes back to previously displayed non-dialog screen or back to gameplay
    -   That means that new dialogs always replace already opened ones, if any
-   Dialogs can be configured to be accessible from Pause menu
    -   This replaces and expands the "Server Links" button added in previous versions
-   New key bind called "Quick Actions" has been added to allow accessing content-configured dialogs
-   Most dialogs follow a common layout, however exact contents depend on type:
    -   Header with title and warning button
    -   Body elements, scrollable if needed:
        -   messages and items
        -   inputs
        -   actions buttons
    -   Optional footer, contains main buttons and submit actions

> **Developer's Note**: _Dialogs are not supposed to fully describe any in-game UI, but just to allow custom content to display simple messages and get input from users. This feature is intentionally limited to match that use case._

![An example of a custom Dialog screen.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/1.21.6customdialogscaled.jpg)

        -   only available if `pause` is `false` to avoid locking the game in single-player mode
    -   `wait_for_response` - replace the current dialog with a "Waiting for Response" screen
        -   this option is intended to prevent users from sending multiple actions on laggy connections
            -   servers are expected to eventually replace this screen with a new dialog
        -   to avoid accidental locking, a "Back" button will become active after 5 seconds
            -   clicking this button will continue as if the dialog was closed (i.e., game returns to the previous non-dialog screen, if any)

-   `initial` - initial contents, default: `""` (empty)
-   `max_length` - maximum length of the text input, positive integer with default of 32
-   `multiline` - if present, allows users to input multiple lines, optional object with fields:
    -   `max_lines` - if present, limits maximum lines, optional positive integer
    -   `height` - height of input, optional integer in range `1` to `512`
        -   If this field is omitted, but `max_lines` is present, the height will be chosen to fit the maximum number of lines (but can't exceed `512`)
        -   If this and `max_lines` are both omitted, it will default to a height that fits 4 lines

###### `minecraft:boolean`

-   A plain checkbox with a label
-   Output values:
    -   As template substitution: `on_true` when checked, `on_false` when unchecked
    -   As tag: `1b` when checked, `0b` when unchecked

Fields:

-   `label` - a text component to be displayed to the right of control
-   `initial` - an initial value, default: `false` (i.e., unchecked)
-   `on_true` - a string value to send when control is checked, default: `true`
-   `on_false` - a string value to send when control is unchecked, default: `false`

###### `minecraft:single_option`

-   Output values:
    -   As template substitution: contents of `id` field of currently selected option
    -   As tag: a string tag with contents of `id` field of currently selected option

Fields:

-   `label` - a text component to be displayed on the button
-   `label_visible` - if `true`, label will be incorporated into button text, default: `true`
-   `width` - width of the button, integer from `1` to `1024` (inclusive) with default: `200`
-   `options` - a list of objects with fields:
    -   `id` - a string value to send on submit
    -   `display` - a text component to display on button, optional (if not present, `id` is used)
    -   `initial` - an optional boolean flag that selects initial option (only one option can have this be set to `true`)
    -   Additionally, the list might also contain a plain string - in that case it's equivalent to a single entry with field `id` set to that string and other fields set to default

###### `minecraft:number_range`

-   A slider for picking a numeric value out of some range
-   Sends currently selected value
-   Output values:
    -   As template substitution: text representation of current value

#### Actions

Dialogs have at least one action, presented to the user as a button. After every action dialog will always evaluate contents of `after_action` field (see above).

Fields:

-   `label` - a button label, text component
-   `tooltip` - an optional text component to display when the button is hovered or focused
-   `width` - the width of the button, integer from `1` to `1024` (inclusive) with default `150`
-   `action` - an action to perform when the button is clicked, optional object with fields:
    -   `type` - value from `minecraft:dialog_action_type` registry
    -   `<type-specific>` - see below, depends on `type`

##### Static Dialog Action Types

All existing `click_event` actions (except for `open_file`) are included as dialog action types.

Uses same format as `click_event` on text components (but with `action` replaced with `type`) For example, when using `show_dialog`, the entry for action button will look like this:

    {
        "label": "some label",
        "action": {
            "type": "show_dialog",
            "dialog": "some:id"
        }
    }
    

##### `minecraft:dynamic/run_command` Action Type

-   This action will build a `run_command` event using a provided macro template
-   The macro will be expanded with string values from inputs
    -   For example, if the macro template is `some_command $(some_input)`, the string value from input with `key` of `some_input` parameter will be used for the template expansion
    -   Inputs not used in macro will be ignored, while macro parameters not matching any inputs will be replaced with an empty string

Fields:

-   `template` - a string with a macro template to be interpreted as a command

###### `minecraft:dynamic/custom` Action Type

-   This method will build a `minecraft:custom` event using all input values
-   All input contents will be sent together inside a compound tag, with tag value of each input put under id from `key` field of that input
-   Additional static fields can be added to payload

Fields:

-   `additions` - fields to be added to payload, optional compound tag
-   `id` - namespaced ID

##### Built-in Dialogs

The built-in datapack contains some custom dialogs to provide customization of specific screens used by the client.

###### `minecraft:server_links`

-   Replacement for the previously existing "Server Links" screen
-   Meant to simplify migration for servers that previously used this feature

###### `minecraft:custom_options`

-   Shows contents of `minecraft:pause_screen_additions` tag (see below)
-   Allows the user to select a specific dialog if this tag contains multiple entries
-   Note: Since this tag is meant for interoperability, any content that replaces this dialog should be careful not to hide other dialog providers

#### Dialog Command

-   New command has been added to show dialog to clients

Syntax:

-   `dialog show <targets> <dialog>` - show dialog to player(s)
    -   `<targets>` - player name, UUID or a player selector
    -   `<dialog>` - a namespaced ID from `minecraft:dialog` registry or inline dialog value as described above
    -   Returns the number of players in `targets` argument
-   `dialog clear <targets>` - clean dialog for player(s), if they have any visible
    -   `<targets>` - player name, UUID or a player selector
    -   Returns the number of players in `targets` argument

#### Pause Screen Configuration

-   A data pack can request some of the available dialogs to be accessible from Pause screen
-   This feature replaces the "Server Links" button and is placed on Pause screen according to the same rules
-   Buttons leading to dialogs exposed in this way will use label described in `external_title` field
-   This feature is configured by `minecraft:pause_screen_additions` dialog tag:
    -   If this tag is not specified or is empty but the server has sent `server_links` packet, the tag will be handled as if it contained `minecraft:server_links` dialog
        -   Note: this matches previous Server Links feature behavior
        -   If this dialog is removed, the tag remains empty
    -   If this tag is still empty, the button will not be visible ("Send Feedback" and "Report Bugs" buttons are visible instead)
    -   If this tag has a single element, the pause screen button will lead directly to that dialog
    -   If this tag has multiple elements, the pause screen button will lead to a `minecraft:custom_options` dialog which (by default) lets user select one of the tag elements
        -   If this dialog is removed, the button is will not be visible

#### Quick Actions Key Bind

-   A new key bind has been added that allows users to access a set of dialogs
-   Default key: `G`
-   This feature is configured by `minecraft:quick_actions` dialog tag
    -   If this tag is empty, the key bind will do nothing
    -   If this tag has a single element, the key bind will open that dialog
    -   If this tag has multiple elements, the key bind will lead to `minecraft:quick_actions` dialog which (by default) lets user select one of the tag elements
        -   If this dialog is removed, the key bind will do nothing
-   This option is intended for use in custom content and by servers, so this tag is empty in the Vanilla pack

### Text Components

#### Click Events

-   Users will now be prompted for confirmation before executing a command from the `run_command` click action in books and chat if the command can't be parsed or requires elevated permissions (i.e., higher than 0)

##### Added `minecraft:custom`

-   A new click action called `minecraft:custom` has been added
    -   When user clicks a component with this click action, the client will send a dedicated packet `minecraft:custom_click_action` to a server
    -   The intended use is as an alternative for `run_command` to be used by modded servers without worrying about having to add custom commands
    -   This packet has no functionality on Vanilla servers
    -   Fields:
        -   `id` - namespaced ID
        -   `payload` - optional tag field

##### Added `minecraft:show_dialog`

-   A new action called `show_dialog` has been added
    -   When user clicks this component, a dialog will be opened for them
    -   Fields:
        -   `dialog` - a namespaced ID from `minecraft:dialog` registry or inline dialog value as described above

### Game Rules

#### Added `locatorBar`

-   Default is `true`: enabling the Locator Bar
-   Changing to `false` will remove all existing Waypoints from all players

### Attributes

#### Added `camera_distance`

-   Default value: `4.0`
-   Modifies the distance at which the camera is placed away from the player or spectated entity when in a third-person view
-   If the entity being ridden has a larger `camera_distance` attribute, that distance will be used
-   This distance is multiplied by the `scale` attribute to get a final target camera distance

#### Added `waypoint_transmit_range` and `waypoint_receive_range`

-   Default: `0.0`, Minimum: `0.0`, Maximum: `60000000.0`
    
-   Players have a default transmission and reception range of 60,000,000
    
-   Mobs with a transmission range above zero will send waypoint packets to nearby receivers that are within that range
    
-   Similarly, receivers only receive waypoints that are inside their reception range (and receive nothing if that range is zero) Examples:
    
-   `/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_transmit_range base set 0` will prevent a player from transmitting (hiding them)
    
-   `/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_transmit_range base set 80` will only let a player transmit up to 80 blocks (hiding them from players further than that)
    
-   `/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_receive_range base set 0` will prevent a player from receiving (turns off their Locator Bar)
    
-   `/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_receive_range base set 120` will only let a player see Locator Bar dots that are within 120 blocks (hiding all players further than that)
    

#### Changed `flying_speed`

-   The `flying_speed` attribute now also applies to Ghasts and Happy Ghasts

### Data Components

#### `equippable` Item Component

-   Added a new optional field: `can_be_sheared` (boolean)
    -   If `true`, players can use Shears to remove this equippable item from a target mob by right-clicking, provided all other shearing conditions are satisfied
    -   If not specified, it defaults to `false`
-   Added a new optional field: `shearing_sound` (sound event)
    -   It's a sound event that plays when the equippable item is sheared
    -   If not specified, it defaults to the `item.shears.snip` sound event

#### `attribute_modifiers` Item Component

-   Added an optional `display` field to `attribute_modifiers` entries
    -   There are 3 `display` types:
        -   `default` - Current behavior of showing the calculated attribute modifier values on the tooltip
        -   `hidden` - Does not show the attribute modifier entry
        -   `override` - Replaces the shown attribute modifier text
            -   Contains a single field `value` for the text contents to show for this attribute modifier entry

#### `painting/variant` Item Component

-   No longer accepts inline variants

### Entity Data

-   Added the `home_pos` and `home_radius` fields to all mobs
    -   Mobs with set home position will limit their pathfinding to stay within the indicated area
    -   Some mobs, such as Bats, Slimes, Magma Cubes, Phantoms and Ender Dragons may ignore it
    -   Interacting with leashes or riding may change the home position of the mob

#### `area_effect_cloud`

-   The `Particle` field has been renamed to `custom_particle`, and now always functions as an exact override for the default colored `entity_effect` particle
    -   The field will not be written if no override is specified
    -   The color will no longer be inherited from the potion contents when specifying the `entity_effect` or `tinted_leaves` particle types

#### `tnt`

-   The entity that primed the TNT is now stored in an optional `owner` field (UUID of Living entity)

#### `vex`

-   The owner of a Vex is now stored in an optional `owner` field (UUID of mob)

### Advancements

Added `minecraft:player_sheared_equipment` trigger

-   Can Trigger when a player shears off a shearable equipment from an Entity
-   Conditions:
    -   `item` - Item that is sheared
    -   `entity` - The entity that was sheared

### Tags

#### Block Tags

-   Added `#triggers_ambient_desert_dry_vegetation_block_sounds` - blocks that can trigger ambient desert dry vegetation sounds to play from blocks above
-   Added `#happy_ghast_avoids` - blocks that Happy Ghasts avoid getting close to
-   `#plays_ambient_desert_block_sounds` has been renamed to `#triggers_ambient_desert_sand_block_sounds`

### Waypoint Styles

These define custom icons to be displayed on the Locator Bar and are within the `waypoint_style/` asset directory.

-   `near_distance` and `far_distance` are optional and default to the values `128` and `332` respectively
    -   `far_distance` distance must be greater than `near_distance`
-   `sprites` is a list of at least one sprite IDs within the prefix of `hud/locator_bar_dot/` (the directory `textures/gui/sprites/hud/locator_bar_dot`)
-   An example "bowtie" waypoint style is provided and accessible via the command:
    -   `/waypoint modify <entity-selector> style set bowtie`
-   When the distance to the waypoint is less than `near_distance`, the first sprite in the list will be selected
-   When the distance to the waypoint is greater than `far_distance`, the last sprite in the list will be selected
-   Between this range, sprites will be selected based on the linear progress between the near and far distances

### Sounds

-   Changed location on the sounds for Glow Squid, Squid, Guardian, Horse, Rabbit and Pufferfish from `entity` folder to the `mob` folder
-   Added `entity/leashknot/break` for when a Lead snaps
-   The following sounds have been renamed:

    -   `item.saddle.unequip`

### UI Sprites

-   The mob effect atlas has been removed, and sprites in the `textures/mob_effect/` folder are now included within the GUI atlas
    -   This means mob effect sprites now support GUI sprite scaling properties
-   Added `icon/music_notes` and `toast/now_playing` sprites

### Font

#### Unifont

-   Updated Unifont to 16.0.03
-   Added previously omitted Unifont glyphs for Private Use Areas
    -   Those glyphs are loaded as a separate sub-font `minecraft:include/unifont_pua` and are not included in any normally used font
    -   Characters in those areas are managed by Under-CSUR (Under-ConScript Unicode Registry), which adds various scripts not present in official Unicode set, like Tengwar or Sitelen Pona

#### `unihex` Font Provider

-   The `size_overrides` field is now optional (defaults to empty list)

### Equipment Assets

-   Added new `happy_ghast_body` layer type, rendering in the body slot of the Happy Ghast

### Item Models

-   Item model definitions now have a boolean field `oversized_in_gui` which is `false` by default
    -   If `true`, the item model will be allowed to be bigger than its item slot
    -   If `false`, the item model will be clipped to the item slot size when being rendered in gui
    -   This ability of items being rendered outside their slots should not be considered officially supported, it was temporarily restored as an exception since many servers are relying on it
    -   At some point in the future we hope to replace it with an officially supported way of achieving similar functionality
-   Introduced new item model `minecraft:player_head` to handle player profile texture loading and rendering
-   Removed support for `minecraft:profile` from `minecraft:head`

#### `minecraft:player_head` Special Model Type

-   Renders a player head
-   Uses profile from `minecraft:profile` component to load a texture. Renders a default texture until the profile texture is fully loaded
-   No fields

#### `minecraft:head` Special Model Type

-   No longer supports profile from `minecraft:profile` component to load a player texture
-   Renders a default player texture when `kind` is `player` and no texture override is supplied
-   Fields remain unchanged

### Block Models

-   `elements[].rotation.angle` value in block models is no longer limited to multiplies of `22.5` degrees and can now be any angle from `-45` to `+45`

### Shaders & Post-process Effects

> **Developer's Note**: _Although it is possible in Resource Packs, overriding Core Shaders is considered as unsupported and not an intended Resource Pack feature. These shaders exist as part of the internal implementation of the game, and as such, may change at any time as the game's internals evolve. We understand that overriding Core Shaders is used for very cool Resource Pack features, many of which lack supported alternatives. We would like to provide better, supported alternatives in the future._

-   All built-in uniforms are now uniform blocks instead of opaque loose uniforms
-   Custom uniforms provided to post-process shaders are now uniform blocks
-   Uniform definitions inside json files are now per-block

#### Post-process Effect Definitions

-   Entries in the `targets` map have been expanded to support new properties
    -   New optional boolean field: `persistent` (default: `false`)
        -   If `true`, this render target will be persistent across frames
        -   The contents of the target will be cleared when the screen is resized
    -   New optional field: `clear_color` (default: `[0, 0, 0, 0]`)
        -   Format: integer ARGB value, or float array in order `[R, G, B, A]`
        -   When this target is created or cleared, it will be filled with this color
-   The `uniforms` values is now a list-per-block, instead of a global list
    -   e.g. `uniforms: { "UniformBlockName": [ { "type": "vec2", "value": [...] } ] }`
        -   The order of uniforms in a block **must** match the order in the shader
-   `name` as part of a uniform definition is no longer used
    -   We encourage setting it to help keep the json file organized/readable, but the game won't use it
-   `value` as part of a uniform definition replaces the old `values`, and the type depends on the `type` field
    -   This field is required
    -   `"type": "int"` needs `"value": 123` (a single int)
    -   `"type": "float"` needs `"value": 123.4` (a single float)
    -   `"type": "vec2"` needs `"value": [1.2, 3.4]` (two floats)
    -   `"type": "vec3"` needs `"value": [1.2, 3.4, 5.6]` (three floats)
    -   `"type": "ivec3"` needs `"value": [1, 2, 3]` (three ints)
    -   `"type": "vec4"` needs `"value": [1.2, 3.4, 5.6, 7.8]` (four floats)
    -   `"type": "matrix4x4"` needs `"value": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0, 15.0, 16.0]` (four rows of four columns of floats)
-   We do not validate that the uniform block is valid for a given shader, giving incorrect information will cause undefined and funky behavior

#### Post-process Effect Shaders

-   Instead of every uniform being an individual opaque type, they are now grouped in uniform blocks
    -   They will be set according to the pass definition in the json file, and may be shared across both vertex and fragment shaders
-   The list of sizes (all `vec2 *Size` uniforms) are now replaced with a single `SamplerInfo` uniform block
    -   This contains, _in order_, the size of the output texture followed by the size of every input texture
    -   The order of textures in the definition file will dictate the order of samplers in this uniform
    -   For most post chains this is just `OutSize` and `InSize` as before
    -   All sizes are `vec2`

##### `post/bits.fsh`

-   Expects a `BitsConfig` of `float Resolution` and `float MosaicSize`

##### `post/blit.fsh`

-   Expects a `BlitConfig` of `vec4 ColorModulate`

##### `post/blur.vsh` and `post/box_blur.fsh`

-   Expects a `BlurConfig` of `vec2 BlurDir` and `float Radius`

##### `post/color_convolve.fsh`

-   Expects a `ColorConfig` of `vec3 RedMatrix`, `vec3 GreenMatrix` and `vec3 BlueMatrix`

##### `post/invert.fsh`

-   Expects a `InvertConfig` of `float InverseAmount`

##### `post/rotscale.vsh`

-   Expects a `RotScaleConfig` of `vec2 InScale`, `vec2 InOffset` and `float InRotation`

##### `post/spiderclip.fsh`

-   Expects a `SpiderConfig` of `vec4 Scissor` and `vec4 Vignette`

#### Shader Fog Changes

-   The fog is now split into environmental and render-distance-based fog
-   Previously both those concepts were mixed in the same uniforms
-   Environmental fog is supposed to represent the "fogginess" of the environment the player is in
    -   e.g. lava, water, and now also atmosphere
-   Render distance fog is supposed to obscure the border of visible terrain
-   Environmental fog uses spherical distance to determine its intensity, render distance fog uses cylindrical distance
-   The resulting fog value for any given vertex is the maximum of both

#### `Globals` Uniform Block

-   Available through `#moj_import <minecraft:globals.glsl>` for convenience
-   Most shaders are able to receive this uniform block, even if they don't normally use it
-   Contains `ScreenSize`, `GlintAlpha`, `GameTime` and `MenuBlurRadius` (new)
    -   `MenuBlurRadius` is the blur radius of the background when a menu is open

#### `Fog` Uniform Block

-   Available through `#moj_import <minecraft:fog.glsl>` for convenience
-   Most shaders are able to receive this uniform block, even if they don't normally use it
-   Contains `FogColor`, `FogEnvironmentalStart` (new), `FogEnvironmentalEnd` (new), `FogRenderDistanceStart` (renamed from `FogStart`), `FogRenderDistanceEnd` (renamed from `FogEnd`), `FogSkyEnd` (new) and `FogCloudsEnd` (new)
    -   `FogSkyEnd` is new and represents where the fog should end when drawing for the sky
    -   `FogCloudsEnd` is new and represents where the fog should end when drawing the clouds
    -   `FogRenderDistanceStart` is the render distance fog start
    -   `FogRenderDistanceEnd` is the render distance fog end
    -   `FogEnvironmentalStart` is new and represents the start of environment-based fog
    -   `FogEnvironmentalEnd` is new and represents the end of environment-based fog

-   Added two new types of grass: Short Dry Grass and Tall Dry Grass
-   Both are 1 block high, which means Tall Dry Grass differs from regular Tall Grass which is 2 blocks high
-   Both generate in the Desert and Badlands biomes
-   Both can be placed on types of Sand, Terracotta, Dirt blocks, and Farmland like the Dead Bush
-   Both can be bonemealed
    -   Using Bone Meal on Short Dry Grass grows it into a Tall Dry Grass
    -   Using Bone Meal on Tall Dry Grass grows a Short Dry Grass in a random adjacent space if possible
-   Both can be used in the Composter
-   Sheep can eat both to regrow their wool
-   Both can be used as fuel for smelting
-   Both are replaceable when building

### Cactus Flower

-   Cactus Flower is a new type of flower that has a chance of generating on Cactuses in Deserts and Badlands
-   Cactus Flower can be placed on Cactus blocks, Farmland, or any block which has center support at the top of the block
-   Cactus Flowers have a chance of growing on Cactus blocks instead of the Cactus growing taller
    -   If a Cactus is 1-2 blocks tall, the Cactus Flower has a 10% chance to grow
    -   If a Cactus is 3 blocks or taller the Cactus Flower has a 25% chance to grow
    -   Cactus Flowers will only grow if they have space on all four sides
-   Cactus Flowers can be used in the Composter
-   A Cactus Flower can be used to craft 1 Pink Dye

### Falling Leaf Particles

-   All Leaves blocks now have chance of spawning falling leaf particles
-   The following blocks are affected by this change:
    -   Acacia Leaves
    -   Azalea Leaves
    -   Birch Leaves
    -   Dark Oak Leaves
    -   Flowering Azalea Leaves
    -   Jungle Leaves
    -   Mangrove Leaves
    -   Oak Leaves
    -   Spruce Leaves

### New Ambient Sounds for Desert and Badlands

-   Sand, Red Sand and Terracotta of any color have a chance of playing ambient sounds when surrounded by another block in the same group on at least 3 sides, at a distance of 8 blocks
    -   `block.sand.idle` can be played in any biome
    -   `block.sand.wind` only plays when in Desert or Badlands biomes
-   Dead Bush blocks have a chance of playing ambient sounds when placed on top of two blocks that are any color of Terracotta, Sand or Red Sand blocks in any biome

## Changes

-   The main menu panorama has been updated for the "Spring to Life" drop
-   Beacons and their beams now render beyond 16 chunks, up to the client render distance
    -   To keep it easily visible at large distances, the beam is rendered thicker the further away you are
    -   The beam now renders up to 2048 blocks high, up from 1024

    > **Developer's Note**: _After consideration, we have decided to revert this fix. While we do want to revisit these mechanics in the future, it's clear that these recent fixes alone didn't quite hit the mark and caused too many negative side effects for parkour, speedbridging, and movement in general_

### Simulation Distance

-   Any block in simulation distance of a player, or loaded by another source of chunk loading such as Ender Pearls, may now receive random ticks instead of 8 chunks just around players
    -   For example: if a chunk is loaded by an Ender Pearl or is in the spawn chunks, crops are able to grow, Ice can melt, Snow can fall, and a Cauldron can be filled by rain
    -   Mob spawning, Lava spreading fire, and Lightning strikes still occur in the previous radius of 8 chunks around players
-   Fire will no longer burn or spread if no player is within 8 chunks

### Creaking and Creaking Heart

-   Creakings can now be named using Name Tags
    -   Named Creakings will persist through the day

-   Creaking Hearts correctly placed between Logs have a new dormant texture during the day
    -   Dormant Creaking Hearts cannot spawn new Creakings or Resin
-   The transition between the awake and dormant states for Creaking Hearts, as well as the transition of Eye Blossoms is now based on the fixed day time
    -   All these behaviors are no longer affected by weather or dimension brightness

### Mob Texture and Model Changes

-   The look of the temperate Cow has been slightly updated to have an extruded snout
-   The look of both Mooshroom variants have been slightly updated to have an extruded snout

-   Bubble columns produce less particles and sounds when entities are unaffected by them are inside them
-   Pale Oak Leaves and Pale Oak Saplings have an updated map color
-   Improved tooltips for the Crossbow and all container items

#### Item Tooltips

-   Crossbows will now show all charged projectiles in their tooltip instead of just the first
    -   All charged projectiles will also add their entire tooltip as a subsection, instead of only Fireworks
-   All container items with stored contents, such as a Chest picked with Ctrl+Pick Block, will now list the first 4 items in their tooltip just like Shulker Boxes

### Sound Changes

-   The volume of the narrator is now affected by the game's configured volume in the "Voice" category
-   Added new break, place, step, fall and hit sounds for Iron Blocks, Iron Bars, Iron Trapdoors, Iron Doors and Heavy Weighted Pressure Plates
-   The breaking sound for the "grass" sound type has been lowered
-   Blocks that are broken by a Piston now play their breaking sound
-   Ambient block sounds in Desert, Badlands and Pale Garden which are only used for ambience have been moved from the "Blocks" to the 'Ambient/Environment' category

### Realms World Uploads

-   Uploading a world to Realms will now enable Command Blocks by default
-   It is now possible to upload Hardcore singleplayer worlds to Realms

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 71
-   The Resource Pack version is now 55
-   A new entry point is present in the server jar: `net.minecraft.gametest.Main`
    -   Automatically starts a server and runs all available game tests
-   A new command line argument is available for the client: `--renderDebugLabels`
    -   Adds debug labels to relevant OpenGL objects, making debugging rendering easier for developers
-   Minor changes to chat network protocol

### Game Test Entry Point

This new entry point automatically starts a server, runs all available game test, and then exits.

Options:

-   `--help` - Shows usage information
-   `--packs <path>` - Set a folder of data packs to include in the world
    -   Any zip file or folder containing a `pack.mcmeta` file is included
-   `--report <path>` - Exports results in a JUnit-like XML report at the given path
-   `--tests <selection>` - Specify which tests to run with a selection - a wildcard expression matching namespace test instance IDs
    -   If omitted, or used with an empty ID, all tests will be run
-   `--universe <path>` - The path in which the test server world will be created
    -   Any existing folder will be replaced
    -   Default: `gametestserver`
-   `--verify <boolean>` - Enables test verification
    -   Runs the tests specified with `test` or `testNamespace` 100 times for each 90-degree rotation step
    -   Default: `false`

Example usage: `java -DbundlerMainClass="net.minecraft.gametest.Main" -jar server.jar --packs mytestpacks`

### Network Protocol

-   The clientbound `player_chat` packet now contains an index increasing for every message sent to the client
    -   The index starts at 0 when logging in (or is reset by configuration phase and the `login` packet)
    -   For every message, the server should increment this value by 1
    -   If this value updates in an unexpected way, the client will disconnect
    -   As the protocol requires that every chat packet reaches the client in produced order, the goal is to enable faster detection of missed/reordered chat messages for custom server developers
-   The serverbound `chat` and `chat_command_signed` packets now contain a checksum byte along with the "last seen" update
    -   This is a simple hash of the "last seen" signatures which should be reconstructed by the server, allowing quicker detection of desynchronized state
    -   This can be passed as `0` to disable the check, for compatibility with protocol translation

## Data Pack Versions 62 through 71

    -   Items in the `saddle` slot can apply attribute modifiers as with other equipment
-   Changes to `crafting_transmute`, `smithing_transform`, and `smithing_trim` recipe types
-   Trim pattern and trim material items are no longer specified in the trim registries, but instead in the recipes and items respectively

### Game Tests

![Kai is seen testing curious behaviors with the new test blocks.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/1.21.5qctest.jpg)

The Game Tests system is a new integrated system for testing aspects of the game. Each test is an asset defining some parameters for how the test gets executed, combined with a saved structure file containing a base setup.

Generally, the test framework expects to run tests in a separate superflat world.

#### Test Instances

![A game test is running, where a villagers is seen running through a maze to get to their bed.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/1.21.5villagertest.jpg)

Test instances are defined in the registry `test_instance`. They're small assets defining a test to run.

Fields:

-   `environment`: Namespaced ID of the test environment to run this test as part of
-   `structure`: The namespaced ID of the structure to use for the test
-   `max_ticks`: A positive integer representing the maximum number of ticks allowed to pass before the test is considered timed out
-   `setup_ticks`: Optional non-negative integer (default: `0`) representing a number of ticks to wait after placing the structure before starting the test
-   `required`: Optional boolean (default `true`) - whether the test is considered required to pass for the full test suite to pass
-   `rotation`: Optional rotation to apply to the test structure
    -   One of `none` (default), `clockwise_90`, `180` and `counterclockwise_90`
-   `manual_only`: Optional boolean (default `false`), set to `true` for tests that are not included as part of automated test runs
-   `sky_access`: Whether the test needs clear access to the sky
    -   By default (`false`), tests are enclosed in barrier blocks - if set to `true`, the top is left open
-   `max_attempts`: Number of attempts to run the test (default `1`)
-   `required_successes`: Number of attempts that must succeed for the test to be considered successful (default `1`)
-   `type`: The type of test - one of `block_based` and `function`

##### Function Tests

Function tests rely on built-in functions to run a test and indicate success or failure. They have one additional field:

-   `function`: The namespaced ID of the Test Function to run

See the "Using the Game Test Framework from Code" changelog section for more information.

##### Block Based Tests

Block based tests use Test Blocks in the test structure to run the test and indicate success or failure.

#### Test Environments

Test Environments are a way to group up tests and give them the right preconditions to run. A Test Environment is an asset in the `test_environment` registry. Each Test Environment definition has a `type` field that determines its setup:

-   `all_of` definitions apply the setup from several sub-definitions in the `definitions` field
-   `function` definitions use mcfunction files as setup and teardown
    -   `setup`: Optional namespaced ID of the mcfunction to use for setup, if any
    -   `teardown`: Optional namespaced ID of the mcfunction to use for teardown, if any
-   `game_rules`: definitions set any number of game rules
    -   `bool_rules`: A list of boolean game rules to set and the value to set
    -   `int_rules`: A list of integer game rules to set and the value to set
    -   Each rule is an object with two fields:
        -   `rule`: The exact name of the rule to set
        -   `value`: The value to set
    -   Game rules are reset to their default values after the test environment has completed
-   `weather` definitions sets the weather state
    -   `weather`: The weather to set - one of `clear`, `rain` and `thunder`
-   `time_of_day` definitions set a given time of day
    -   `time`: The time of day to set in number of ticks, as a non-negative integer

The game provides a single, empty Test Environment by default: `minecraft:default`.

#### Test Blocks

The Test Block is a block used for implementing a block-based tests. It has four modes:

-   `start`: Triggers a redstone pulse when the test starts
-   `log`: Logs a message to the log file when powered by redstone
-   `fail`: Fails the test when powered by redstone
-   `accept`: Completes the test when powered by redstone

Block-based tests are required to have at least one `start` block and one `accept` block in the structure.

#### The `test` Command

The `test` command is a new command used to create and run tests.

Syntax:

    test clearall [<radius>]
    test clearthat
    test clearthese
    
    test create <test> [<width>] [<height> <depth>]
    
    test locate <selector>
    
    test resetclosest
    test reseetthese
    test resetthat
    
    test pos [<variable>]
    
    test run <selector> [<numberOfTimes>] [<untilFailed>] [<rotationSteps>] [<testsPerRow>]
    test runclosest [<numberOfTimes>] [<untilFailed>]
    test runfailed [<numberOfTimes>] [<untilFailed>] [<rotationSteps>] [<testsPerRow>]
    test runmultiple <selector> [<amount>]
    test runthat [<numberOfTimes>] [<untilFailed>]
    test runthese [<numberOfTimes>] [<untilFailed>]
    
    test stop
    
    test verify <tests>
    

Parameters:

-   `radius`: The radius to clear tests within
-   `test`: The namespaced ID of a test
-   `selector`: A wildcard-enabled selector for test IDs
    -   Supports `*` and `?` for matching namespaced IDs
    -   If namespace is not supplied, defaults to `minecraft`
    -   Examples:
        -   `*:*` - matches all IDs
        -   `*` - matches everything in the `minecraft` namespace
        -   `custom:folder/*_test_?` - matches IDs in the `folder` folder of the `custom` namespace, with a prefix followed by `_test_` followed by a single valid character
-   `width`: The width of the test structure - if omitted, `5` is used
-   `height`: The height of the test structure - if omitted, the width is used
-   `depth`: The depth of the test structure - if omitted, the width is used
-   `variable`: The variable name to include in the copied code snippet
-   `numberOfTimes`: The number of times to repeat each test - if omitted, `1` is ued
-   `untilFailed`: Boolean (default `false`) noting that the test should be stopped as soon as one iteration fails
-   `rotationSteps`: Number of extra 90 degree steps to apply to the test - if omitted, `0` is used
-   `testsPerRow`: Number of tests to place per row in a grid layout - if omitted, `8` is used

##### `test clear*`

These subcommands clear the structures and blocks associated with the selected tests.

##### `test create`

This subcommand creates a test setup in the current location for the given test, preparing for a structure of the given size. This gives a starting point for creating the structure for the test.

##### `test locate`

Attempts to locate the given test. Note that only loaded chunks are searched.

##### `test reset*`

These subcommands reset the structures for the selected tests, removing any surrounding barriers and placing the structure in from scratch.

##### `test pos`

Shows the local coordinates to the block pointed at in the test. If the optional variable name is specified, this variable name is used in a code fragment obtained by clicking on the coordinates in the output message.

##### `test run*`

Runs one or more tests. If multiple tests are run at once, they are placed in a grid and run in parallel, although only up to a certain limit. Beyond that limit, tests are run in rounds where each round completes before any tests from the next round are started.

For each test, loads the given structure and runs the associated test. Each test location will have a beacon beam showcasing the test status.

-   Gray beacon = in progress
-   Red = fail (required test)
-   Orange = fail (optional test)
-   Green = success

If a test fails, the error is shown on a lectern book and an overlay.

Note that Game Tests are designed to run on standard superflat worlds. The area around each test is replaced with stone when it runs, and the running test is encased in barrier blocks.

##### `test stop`

This stops all running tests. Note that gameplay events triggered by tests may still remain.

##### `test verify*`

Verifies one or more tests by running multiple instances of the same test.

#### Test Instance Blocks

To run a test in a world, a Test Instance Block is used. This type of block represents the test as placed in the world and is used to interact with that test, to save the structure, reset or run the test.

Using the `test` command to run or create a test will also place a Test Instance Block to control that test.

#### Using the Game Test Framework from Code

The Game Test Framework can also be used from code in a more versatile manner than block-based tests. For this to work, you need to mod the game to add your test functions to the `test_function` registry (`Registries.TEST_FUNCTION`).

Hook into some startup method (pre-registry bootstrap) to add your loader - call `TestFunctionLoader.registerLoader()` with an implementation of `TestFunctionLoader`. Your implementation can then use the provided `register` consumer to register test functions with their namespaced IDs. This namespaced ID can then be referenced in a `function` type Test Instance.

A test function is a `Consumer<GameTestHelper>`, using that `GameTestHelper` instance to manipulate the world and make assertions about the state of the resulting world.

The helper can be used to summon mobs, set blocks, query for blocks and entities and assert the state of the test. Most `GameTestHelper` methods take test-local coordinates, which you can also find using `/test pos`.

Example code that might go along with a test structure with a locked hopper containing a Cod, pointed into a Furnace:

    public void furnaceSmeltsItem(final GameTestHelper helper) {
        helper.setBlock(0, 4, 0, Blocks.AIR);
        helper.succeedWhen(() -> helper.assertContainerContainsSingle(new BlockPos(0, 0, 0), Items.COOKED_COD));
    }
    

More complicated setups will often use `helper.startSequence()` to model sequences of events that must happen.

As opposed to block-based tests, function tests failing will often produce more helpful error messages including the location of whatever failed and what was expected at that location.

### Game Rules

#### `allowFireTicksAwayFromPlayer`

-   When `true`, fire and lava can spread fire outside the 8 chunk range of a player
-   Note: the fire and lava blocks must still be in simulation distance to spread
-   Default value: `false`

#### `tntExplodes`

-   When `false`, TNT will not explode and cannot be ignited
-   Default value: `true`

### Uniform Variant Selection

-   Variants that have spawn rules now use a uniform approach for selection
-   Selection process:
    -   Every variant has a field `spawn_conditions` that contains a list of entries
    -   Every entry has a condition and an integer priority
    -   Conditions for all variants for given entity type are evaluated for the position that entity is being spawned
    -   Entries with a priority lower than the maximum priority of remaining entries are removed
    -   The game randomly picks one entry out of the remaining ones
    -   If no conditions are remaining, the variant remains unchanged from default for that entity
-   Entry format:
    -   `priority` - integer
    -   `condition` - optional structure
        -   Fields:
            -   `type` - see below for values
            -   Additional fields are dependent on `type`
        -   If this field is not present, the condition is always true

#### Spawn Conditions

##### `minecraft:biome`

-   Checks if entity is spawning in specific biomes
-   Fields:
    -   `biomes` - single entry, list or a tag describing biomes

##### `minecraft:moon_brightness`

-   Checks if the current moon brightness is within a certain range
-   Fields:
    -   `range` - floating point range (a single number or an object like `{"min": 1, "max": 2}`)

##### `minecraft:structures`

-   Checks if the entity is spawning in specific structures
-   Fields:
    -   `structures` - single entry, list or a tag describing structures

-   `/setblock` and `/fill` have updated handling of block entities
-   The `horse.saddle` item slot has been renamed to `saddle`, and now supports any entity that can equip a Saddle
-   Text Components in commands such as `/tellraw` or `/title` are now specified with SNBT instead of JSON
-   Text Style in the `/scoreboard` command when specifying the `styled` number format is also now specified with SNBT instead of JSON
-   Text Component arguments in `/bossbar`, `/scoreboard` and `/team` commands are now resolved before use (in the context of entity the held in `@s`)

#### Changes to `/setblock`, `/fill`, `/clone`, and `/place`

-   The behavior of `setblock` and `fill` commands have changed in how they handle block entity data:
    -   If the block entity data is not specified, and the existing block has data, the block entity data will be preserved
    -   If the block entity data is specified, the block entity data will be set to that specified value
    -   To clear block entity data explicitly, you must now specify the block entity data as `{}`
    -   The operation is now successful if either the block state changed or the block entity data changed
-   `fill`, `clone`, `setblock` and `place template` accept a new option: `strict`
    -   If specified, the command will place blocks as-is without triggering block updates or shape updates
-   The `replace` option in the `fill` command is no longer terminal, and can be followed with additional options
-   New syntax for commands to use the new `strict` option, and more flexible use of `replace`:
    -   `fill <from> <to> <block> keep`
    -   `fill <from> <to> <block> [replace <filter>]? [strict|destroy|hollow|outline]?`
    -   `clone [from <sourceDimension>]? <begin> <end> [to <targetDimension>]? <destination> [strict]? [[replace|masked|filtered <filter>] [force|move|normal]?]?`
    -   `setblock <pos> <block> [destroy|keep|replace|strict]?`
    -   `place template <template> [<pos> [<rotation> [<mirror> [<integrity> [<seed> [strict]?]?]?]?]?]?`

### NBT Changes

-   Any interface with NBT data within the game (SNBT representation, `/data`) now supports heterogeneous lists, i.e. ones where elements are not of the same type
    -   Inserting or replacing into a list of a different type with `/data` will no longer give an error
    -   Inserting into an array type (e.g. `[I;1,2,3]`) is still type-restricted
    -   This means that the "wrapper" objects previously used to represent heterogeneous lists will no longer be observable by in-game means
-   `/data` can no longer traverse paths with an empty key (e.g. `/data get ... foo.''.bar`)
-   The NBT file format is unchanged:
    -   Heterogeneous lists are transformed before storage to bypass NBT constraints
    -   Example transform: `['a', {'b':3}]` is stored as `[{'':'a'},{'b':3}]`
    -   Existing external tools will still be able to read NBT files as before, but heterogeneous lists will be displayed in the transformed form
-   No data produced by the game has changed: objects such as Text Components were already producing heterogeneous lists in this form
-   Note: these wrapper objects may never be observed in-game, they are only relevant to developers working with the NBT file or network format directly

### SNBT Changes

-   The text format for describing object-like data in commands (like NBT, text components, predicates, etc.) has been extended
-   To simplify input of data and macro use, SNBT now also supports following operations:
    -   `bool(arg)` - converts argument to boolean
        -   if argument is a boolean value, returns value directly
        -   if argument is a number value, returns `true` if it is non-zero
    -   `uuid(str)` - converts string representation of UUID to integer array

#### Number Format

-   Either whole or fraction parts of a float number can be omitted
    -   Examples: `.1` and `1.` are valid now
-   Float numbers now use E notation
    -   Example: both `1.2e3` and `1.2E3`, `1.2E+3`, `12000e-1` are now a valid way to represent `1200.0`
-   Integer numbers can now be prefixed with `0x` to represent hexadecimal numbers and `0b` to represent binary numbers
    -   Example: `0xbad` (equal to `2989`), `0xCAFE` (equal to `51966`), `0b101` (equal to `5`)
-   Non-zero integer numbers now can't start with `0`
    -   Normally it would mean number is in base-8, but we are restricting it to avoid accidental use
-   Numbers can now contain `_` character between sequences of digits (but not at the start or the end of sequence)
    -   Example: `0b10_01`, `0xAB_CD`, `1_2.3_4__5f`, `1_2e3_4`
-   `NaN`, `Inf` or hexadecimal float representation are NOT supported
-   Implicit infinite float values (like `1e1000`) are rejected
-   Type suffixes have been extended:
    -   Integer type suffixes (`b` or `B` - byte, `s` or `S` - short, `i` or `I` - integer, `l` or `L` - long) can now be prefixed with `s` (signed) or `u` unsigned
    -   New suffixes only affect the valid range when parsing - values are still stored as signed
        -   Example: `240ub` is equal to `-16sb`, while `240sb` does not parse
    -   When a suffix is used without `u` or `s`, it defaults to signed for decimal numbers and unsigned for binary and hexadecimal numbers
    -   Note: since `b` is also a valid hexadecimal digit, byte sized hexadecimal values can only be written with a signed suffix, like `0x11ub` or `0x11sb`

#### Strings

-   Quoted strings can now use escape sequences beyond `\'`, `\"` and `\\`:
    -   Unicode escapes:
        -   `\x` - two digit escape, like `\x42`
        -   `\u` - four digit escape, like `\u2603`
        -   `\U` - eight digit escape, like `\U00002603`
        -   `\N{<name>}` - named Unicode character, like `\N{Snowman}`
    -   Built-in escape sequences:
        -   `\b` - backspace, Unicode `\x08`
        -   `\s` - space, Unicode `\x20`
        -   `\t` - horizontal tab, Unicode `\x09`
        -   `\n` - linefeed, Unicode `\u0a`
        -   `\f` - form feed, Unicode `\u0c`
        -   `\r` - carriage return, Unicode `\u0d`
-   Unquoted strings now can't start with `0-9`, `.`, `+`, `-` to avoid accidental collision with numbers

#### Number Arrays

-   Values in arrays (`[B;]`, `[I;]`, `[L;]`) without a suffix are now assumed to have suffix matching the type of the array
    
    -   Example: `[B;1,2]` is equivalent to `[B; 1b, 2b]`
-   Arrays can now also accept types smaller than the array type
    
    -   Example: `[I;1b,2s,3]` is valid and equivalent to `[I;1i,2i,3i]`

#### Lists

-   Lists now accept trailing commas
    -   Example: `[1,2,]` is valid and equivalent to `[1,2]`
    -   Only one trailing comma is allowed, and it must come after a valid element - both `[,]` and `[1,,]` are invalid

#### Compounds

-   Compounds (maps) now accept trailing commas
    -   Example: `{a:b,}`
    -   Only one trailing comma is allowed, and it must come after a valid key-value pair - both `{,}` and `{a:b,,}` are invalid

### Text Component Data Format

-   Text Components are no longer stored as JSON wrapped by a string
-   The format itself is the same as before, but inlined directly into the outer structure
    -   For example, the item component `minecraft:custom_name="{\"text\":\"Renamed item\"}"` will become `minecraft:custom_name={text:'Renamed item'}`
-   This includes Text Components passed as arguments to commands such as `/tellraw` or `/title`
    -   For example, `/tellraw @s {"text":"Hello world"}` may become `/tellraw @s {text:'Hello world'}`
-   Note: in the case where Text Components are embedded in NBT, no distinction exists between boolean and integer types
    -   To pass boolean arguments to translations, you must use the string form
-   For Text Components with the `nbt` type and `interpret` set to `true`, Text Components will be parsed from the given NBT directly rather than converting to a string and parsing as JSON
-   The format of hover and click events has been updated

#### Hover Events

-   The `hoverEvent` field has been renamed to `hover_event`
-   The legacy `value` field (which was parsed from a rendered text component) is no longer supported
-   For the `show_text` action:
    -   The `contents` field has been renamed to `value`
    -   e.g. `{action:'show_text',contents:'Hello world'}` becomes `{action:'show_text',value:'Hello world'}`
-   For the `show_item` action:
    -   The `contents` field has been inlined
    -   e.g. `{action:'show_item',contents:{id:'minecraft:stick',count:2}}` becomes `{action:'show_item',id:'minecraft:stick',count:2}`
    -   If contents was specified only as an item id, it is replaced with the full format and inlined
    -   e.g. `{action:'show_item',contents:'minecraft:stick'}` becomes `{action:'show_item',id:'minecraft:stick'}`
-   For the `show_entity` action:
    -   The `contents` field has been inlined
    -   The `id` field has been renamed to `uuid`
    -   The `type` field has been renamed to `id`
    -   e.g. `{action:'show_entity',contents:{id:[I;0,0,0,0],type:'minecraft:pig'}}` becomes `{action:'show_entity',uuid:[I;0,0,0,0],id:'minecraft:pig'}`

#### Click Events

-   The `clickEvent` field has been renamed to `click_event`
-   For the `open_url` action:
    -   The `value` field has been renamed to `url`
    -   The click event will no longer parse if not a valid URI with either `https://` or `http://` schemes, instead of simply not working
    -   e.g. `{action:'open_url',value:'https://minecraft.net'}` becomes `{action:'open_url',url:'https://minecraft.net'}`
-   For the `run_command` action:
    -   The `value` field has been renamed to `command`
    -   The click event will no longer parse if the command contains disallowed characters, instead of simply not working
    -   It is no longer required that the specified `command` field has a `/` prefix
    -   e.g. `{action:'run_command',value:'/tp @e @s'}` becomes `{action:'run_command',command:'/tp @e @s'}`
-   For the `suggest_command` action:
    -   The `value` field has been renamed to `command`
    -   The click event will no longer parse if the command contains disallowed characters, instead of simply not working
    -   e.g. `{action:'suggest_command',value:'/help'}` becomes `{action:'suggest_command',command:'/help'}`
-   For the `change_page` action:
    -   The `value` field has been renamed to `page`
    -   The `page` value now requires a positive integer instead of a string
    -   e.g. `{action:'change_page',value:'1'}` becomes `{action:'change_page',page:1}`
-   The `copy_to_clipboard` format is unchanged

### Entity Data

-   Custom data (previously present only on Marker) is now available on all entities
    -   It's exposed as a `minecraft:custom_data` component, so it can be set by spawning items and matched by predicates
    -   The component is currently stored in a field called `data`, which will be changed in the future when more proper storage for entity components is introduced
    -   It's stored only if it's non-empty
-   Updated and unified formats for storing equipment-related data on entities
-   The `Owner` field of tamed animals is no longer restricted to referencing Players
-   The `Health` and `Air` fields now default to their respective maximum value if not specified
-   The `Tags` and `FallFlying` fields will no longer be preserved if removed
-   The `FallDistance` field has been changed from float to double and is now called `fall_distance`
-   The `SleepingX`, `SleepingY`, and `SleepingZ` fields have been collected into a single `sleeping_pos` field
-   `Pos`, `Motion`, and `Rotation` values without the correct number of components (3, 3, and 2 respectively) will now be fully discarded, instead of only selecting the specified components
    -   e.g. `sleeping_pos: [I;1,2,3]`
-   Block States in the entity data of Arrows, Minecarts, Block Displays, Endermen, Falling Blocks, Primed TNT, or Piston Moving Blocks are no longer allowed to be specified as an empty object
-   Many tweaks to entity data formats of specific entities

#### Equipment Data

-   The `ArmorItems`, `HandItems`, and `body_armor_item` fields have been merged into an `equipment` field
    -   Format: map between equipment slot type and item stack
        -   Valid equipment slots: `head`, `chest`, `legs`, `feet`, `mainhand`, `offhand`, `body`, `saddle`
    -   If not specified or removed, the entity will have no equipment
    -   e.g. `equipment:{chest:{id:'minecraft:diamond_chestplate'}}`
    -   This affects all mobs and Armor Stands
    -   The armor and off-hand equipment of Players is now also stored in the `equipment` field (although items written into the Inventory using armor and off-hand slot numbers still work)
-   The data format of saddles has been unified between mobs such as Horses and Pigs, becoming a new kind of equipment slot (and stored in the `equipment.saddle` field)
    -   This is a pure rename from the previous `SaddleItem` in Horse-like mobs
    -   This also replaces the boolean `Saddle` flag from Pigs and Striders
    -   The Saddle dropping on death is now affected by the `drop_chances` field, as with other equipment slots
-   The `ArmorDropChances`, `HandDropChances`, and `body_armor_drop_chance` fields have been merged into a `drop_chances` field
    -   Format: map between equipment slot type and chance value
    -   If not specified or removed, chances will be assumed as default (`0.085f`)
    -   e.g. `drop_chances:{chest:0.1,feet:1.0}`
-   Drop chances with a default value will no longer be stored, and the `drop_chances` field is removed entirely if all defaults

#### `allay`

-   Removed redundant `CanDuplicate` field (controlled by `DuplicationCooldown`)

        -   Each entry adds to blocked damage, determined by `clamp(base + factor * dealt_damage, 0, dealt_damage)`
        -   The final damage applied in the attack to the entity is determined by `dealt_damage - clamp(blocked_damage, 0, dealt_damage)`
        -   Entry format:
            -   `horizontal_blocking_angle` - angle in degrees as a positive float (default: `90`)
                -   The maximum angle between the user's facing and the incoming attack for the block to be effective
                -   If the damage has no position, the compared angle will be assumed to be the maximum `180`
            -   `type` - damage type id, list of damage type ids, or hash-prefixed damage type tag (optional)
                -   This entry will only contribute to the blocked damage if the dealt damage type matches this field

        -   If not specified, a point of durability is removed for every point of damage blocked
        -   The final damage applied to the item is determined by: `floor(base + factor * damage_blocked)`
        -   The final value may be negative, causing the item to be repaired
        -   Format:
            -   `threshold` - non-negative float
                -   The minimum amount of damage blocked in the attack before item damage is applied to the item
            -   `base` - float
                -   Constant amount of damage applied to the item, if `threshold` is passed
            -   `factor` - float
                -   Fraction of the blocked damage that should be applied to the item, if `threshold` is passed

    -   `disabled_sound` - sound event (optional)
        -   If specified, this sound will be played when the item goes on its disabled cooldown due to an attack

#### New `potion_duration_scale` Item Component

-   When present, for items that have the `potion_contents` component, the duration of the applied effects will be scaled by this factor
-   This also applies to `custom_effects` in the `potion_contents` component, unlike the previous hardcoded scaling factor
-   If not specified, defaults to `1.0`
-   Format: non-negative float
    -   e.g. `potion_duration_scale=0.25`

#### New `break_sound` Item Component

    -   If not specified, defaults to `false`

#### Updated Tooltip Components

-   The way in which tooltips are controlled by components has been reworked
-   Individual `show_in_tooltip` fields, as well as the `hide_additional_tooltip` and `hide_tooltip` components have been replaced by a general `tooltip_display` component
-   Filled Maps without any `map_id` component no longer show an "Unknown Map" tooltip (invalid IDs will still produce this tooltip)

#### New `tooltip_display` Item Component

-   This component allows the tooltips provided specifically by any given item component to be suppressed
-   This replaces the previous `show_in_tooltip` fields, `hide_additional_tooltip` and `hide_tooltip` components
-   Format: object with fields:
    -   `hide_tooltip` - boolean (default: `false`)
        -   If true, the item will have no tooltip when hovered
    -   `hidden_components` - list of item component ids (default: `[]`)
        -   The tooltips provided by any component in this list will be hidden
        -   If that component provides no tooltip, it will have no effect

##### Removed `hide_additional_tooltip` Item Component

-   Replaced by use of the `tooltip_display` component and `hidden_components` field

    -   `minecraft:potion_contents`
    -   `minecraft:tropical_fish/pattern`
    -   `minecraft:written_book_content`
-   This additionally means that tooltips from the above listed components are no longer restricted to specific item types
-   Note: for existing items in a world with the `hide_additional_tooltip` component, any of the above listed components also present on the same item will be added to the list to hide in `tooltip_display`

##### Removed `hide_tooltip` Item Component

-   Replaced by use of the `tooltip_display` component and `hide_tooltip` field

##### `attribute_modifiers` Item Component

-   Removed `show_in_tooltip` field, replaced by `tooltip_display` component

-   This component now always uses its simplified form, with the `rgb` field inlined to top-level
    -   e.g. `dyed_color={rgb:12345}` -> `dyed_color=12345`
-   The specified color now supports the RGB array format
    -   e.g. `dyed_color=[0.5, 1.0, 0.2]`

##### `can_place_on` and `can_break` Item Components

-   Removed `show_in_tooltip` field, replaced by `tooltip_display` component
-   The `predicates` field has been inlined to top-level, and supports either a single element or list

    -   `minecraft:potion_contents` - Lingering Potion to Area Effect Cloud
    -   `minecraft:potion_duration_scale` - Lingering Potion to Area Effect Cloud

### Predicates

#### Entity Predicates

-   New optional fields have been added to entity predicates: `components` and `predicates`
    -   Their functionality and format are identical to the fields `components` and `predicates` on item predicates, but they operate on entity components
        -   When present, `components` will match exact contents of entity components
        -   When present, `predicates` will match partial contents of entity components
    -   In general, any component that is transferred from a spawning item to an entity should be available to this predicate
-   The following entity sub-predicates have been removed and replaced with a combination of the `components` predicate and entity variant components:
    -   `minecraft:axolotl`
    -   `minecraft:cat`
    -   `minecraft:fox`
    -   `minecraft:frog`
    -   `minecraft:horse`

-   Their functionality and format are identical to the fields `components` and `predicates` on item predicates, but they operate on block entity components (when present)
    -   When present, `components` will match exact contents of block entity components
    -   When present, `predicates` will match partial contents of block entity components

### Loot Functions

#### `toggle_tooltips`

-   Now supports any component id in the `toggles` map
-   Any component specified will be toggled in the `tooltip_display` component

### Recipes

#### `crafting_transmute` Recipe Type

-   The `result` field now supports specifying a count and a components patch to apply to the result
-   The components patch is applied to the final transmuted item
-   The new format is an object with fields:
    -   `id` - item id
    -   `count` - positive integer (default: `1`)
    -   `components` - a component patch object (default: empty)
    -   e.g. `"result": {"id": "minecraft:stick", "count": 3, "components": {"!minecraft:damage": {}, "minecraft:enchantment_glint_override": {}}}`
-   The field can still be defined as before as an inline item id (e.g. `"result": "minecraft:stick"`)

#### `smithing_transform` Recipe Type

-   The `base` ingredient field is no longer optional
    -   Previously, if no base ingredient was given, the recipe would parse but never be usable

#### `smithing_trim` Recipe Type

    -   As such, the trim pattern registry definition no longer specifies the item
    -   Format: trim pattern id
    -   e.g. `"pattern": "minecraft:bolt"`

### Trim Patterns and Trim Materials

-   The registry definitions for trim patterns and trim materials no longer include an `item` field
-   Instead, this mapping in patterns and materials is defined by the recipe and item components respectively

### World Generation

### Shaders & Post-process Effects

> **Developer's Note**: _Although it is possible in Resource Packs, overriding Core Shaders is considered as unsupported and not an intended Resource Pack feature. These shaders exist as part of the internal implementation of the game, and as such, may change at any time as the game's internals evolve. We understand that overriding Core Shaders is used for very cool Resource Pack features, many of which lack supported alternatives. We would like to provide better, supported alternatives in the future._

-   Shader program definitions for core shaders and post-processing effects as JSON files have been removed
-   The shader programs themselves are still available and can be overridden
-   The post-processing effects are still configurable as JSON
-   "Global" uniforms may be defined in any shader, and the game will attempt to fill it
    -   Currently, these are: `ModelViewMat`, `ProjMat`, `TextureMat`, `ScreenSize`, `ColorModulator`, `Light0_Direction`, `Light1_Direction`, `GlintAlpha`, `FogStart`, `FogEnd`, `FogColor`, `FogShape`, `LineWidth`, `GameTime`, `ModelOffset`
    -   The type of the uniform must match what it would normally be, or it'll be undefined behavior

#### Post-process Effect Definitions

-   The field `program` was replaced with `vertex_shader` and `fragment_shader`
    -   `<namespace>:<path>` will resolve to `assets/<namespace>/shaders/<path>.<vsh|fsh>`
-   `type` is now a required field for each `uniform`
    -   Possible values are currently `int`, `ivec3`, `float`, `vec2`, `vec3`, `vec4`, `matrix4`
-   `values` in each `uniform` is now optional
    -   Leaving it unset is not recommended and is used for runtime configuration of the blur effect
-   Leaving a uniform unspecified results in undefined behavior, you must specify each one that will be used by the shaders

### Item Rendering

#### Item Display

-   `firstperson_lefthand` and `thirdperson_lefthand` transforms are now rendered the same as when held in hand

#### Item Entity

-   When on ground, model size is now taken into account when determining hovering motion
    -   That means that models should never clip into the block below, no matter what size they are
-   Positioning of items in an item stack on ground now depends on model size and model type
    -   If model depth (Z coordinate) is below 1/16th of a block, item is rendered as flat stack of items
    -   Otherwise, the model is rendered as a cluster of items offset in all directions around center
    -   Previously, flat stack rendering happened only for models with `builtin/generated` parent
