### Happy Ghast

The Happy Ghast is a new mountable flying mob.

**Dried Ghast Block**

-   The Dried Ghast block is found in Nether Fossil structures and is the first stage of the Happy Ghast mob
-   Can be crafted with 1 Soul Sand block and 8 Ghast Tears
-   When waterlogged, it undergoes 3 hydration level changes over approximately 20 minutes until it spawns a Ghastling mob
-   The hydration level decreases when it is no longer waterlogged, using the same timescale
-   The hydration level is not preserved when mined
-   Makes sounds and shows particles depending on its hydration level
-   The Dried Ghast block emits a vibration frequency of 11 when its block state changes

**Ghastling Mob**

-   The Ghastling is a young version of the Happy Ghast mob
-   Spawns from a Dried Ghast block that has continuously been waterlogged for about 20 minutes
-   After spawning, the Ghastling will try and follow:
    -   Players within a 16-block radius or
    -   An adult, non-aquatic passive mob or some of the neutral mobs within a 16-block radius
-   If no player or suitable mob is close around, the Ghastling will idle around within 32 blocks from its home position where it spawned or was last interacted with
    -   It will reset its home position if it is moved more than 16 blocks away from the border of its home position
-   Can be tempted and fed using Snowballs
-   Will grow up into a Happy Ghast after about 20 minutes, or faster if fed Snowballs

**Happy Ghast Mob**

-   Can be equipped with a Harness and then be mounted by up to four players
-   Tempted by Snowballs and Harness
    -   The Happy Ghast can only be tempted with a Harness when it has no harness equipped
-   Slowly regenerates health, with regeneration speeding up during rain, snow or when flying at the same height as clouds
-   The first player that mounts the Happy Ghast will control it, sitting above it in the front seat
    -   When controlled, the goggles of the Happy Ghast flip down to cover its eyes
-   Players mounting after the first player are placed in slots on each side of it, starting clockwise from the first player
-   Pressing the sneak key dismounts the player on top of the Happy Ghast
-   If the Happy Ghast detects players standing on top of it, it ceases all movement and rotates to the closest cardinal direction
    -   This happens regardless of whether it has a Harness equipped or not
-   When mounted on the Happy Ghast, the third-person camera is further away from the player
-   When there are no players mounted or walking on the Happy Ghast, it starts its roaming behavior
    -   If players dismount midair, the Happy Ghast will descend towards the ground before it starts roaming
    -   The roaming behavior is similar to the Ghastling, except for the radius being 64 blocks
    -   When wearing a Harness, the Happy Ghast roams closer to the home position, within a 32 block radius
    -   When leashed, the Happy Ghast has a roaming distance of 10 blocks
    -   The Happy Ghast will try to stay close to blocks when roaming
-   Cannot be bred
-   Cannot enter boats
-   Has no panic behavior when taking damage

-   Can only be equipped on a Happy Ghast
-   Allows up to 4 players to mount the Happy Ghast
-   Can be removed from the Happy Ghast using Shears when no players are mounted

### Locator Bar

The Locator Bar is a new UI element that displays the direction of other players in the world.

-   If another player is in the world (and that player is not hiding) the Locator Bar will display in the same area as experience bar
    -   When experience is gained the experience bar will appear
    -   If there are no other players in the world the experience bar will display as normal
-   Facing other players within a 120 degree range will display those players as colored indicators on the Locator Bar
    -   Other players that are above/below the screen will also display an up/down arrow together with their indicator
    -   The indicator will change to different sized icons depending on how far away the other Player is
    -   Colored indicators are randomized for each player
        -   Operators can modify the colors of indicators with the `/waypoint` command
            -   e.g.: `/waypoint modify @s color red` to set an indicator to red
        -   Players on a team will override their default indicator color with their team color
-   Players can hide by crouching, wearing a mob head or a Carved Pumpkin, or using a Potion of Invisibility
-   Players in Spectator Mode are not visible on the Locator Bar
    -   However, spectators are visible to each other
-   The Locator Bar can be toggled off by setting the `locatorBar` game rule to `false`

### Projectile Targeting

-   The target tolerance margin of projectiles now changes over time
    -   Previously, all projectiles had a target tolerance margin of 0.3 blocks
    -   Now, all projectiles start with no margin for the first two ticks of their flight
    -   After that, the target margin will expand by 0.05 blocks per tick until it reaches the previous 0.3 blocks margin
    -   This allows for better precision close to the shooting player or entity, while still allowing for some collision leeway when the projectile is further away

### Splash Potions

-   Splash Potions distance to affected entities now depends on the closest distance between the entity hitbox and the splash potion hitbox where it landed
    -   This means that if an entity is hit directly by the splash potion, it will receive the full effect of the potion
    -   If the entities are grouped together, they will receive the same effect strength

## Technical Changes

### Commands

**Added `version`**

Prints the current version information on the server side.

-   Takes no arguments
-   Available in singleplayer or for server operators

**Added `datapack create`**

Creates a new empty directory data pack for the current world.

-   The supported pack version is always equal to one supported by the game
-   Available only to server owners
-   Syntax: `datapack create <id> <name>`
    -   `id` - new pack name, must be a valid directory name
    -   `name` - text component to be placed in `description` in `pack.mcmeta`

**Modified `playsound`**

-   Added new category `ui`
    -   Sounds in this category will continue playing when paused, similarly to `music`

**Added `waypoint`**

This is a new command for querying and modifying waypoints.

    waypoint list
    
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> color <color>
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> color hex <hex-color>
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> color reset
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> style <waypoint_style/resource>
    waypoint modify <entity-selector> style reset
    

Arguments:

-   `entity-selector`: For selecting entities that are transmitting as waypoints (see `waypoint_transmit_range` attribute)
-   `color`: Overrides the Locator Bar icon color for this waypoint
-   `hex <hex-color>` arguments are in web format (RRGGBB)
    -   Red is either `hex F00` or `hex FF0000`
    -   Cornflower blue is `hex 6495ED`
-   `style`: For changing the icon spriteset and selection distances
    -   `set <waypoint_style/resource>` changes the style to a specific asset under `waypoint_style/` (see Waypoint Styles section below)
    -   `reset` will restore the default icon behavior of the Locator Bar

### Waypoint Broadcasting

The Locator Bar works through a server-controlled Waypoint system. Waypoints are received by Players, and connections between Waypoints and Players are managed by the multiplayer server.

-   By default, all Players transmit a Waypoint from themselves, and all Players receive all Waypoints
-   Individual Players can have their transmission and receive ranges controlled by the `waypoint_transmit_range` and `waypoint_receive_range` attributes

### Dialogs

-   Added a way to display simple modal dialogs to a user
-   Dialogs are stored in a `minecraft:dialog` registry, but can also be defined inline
-   Dialogs are an experimental feature
-   To avoid user confusion, dialog screens are marked with a warning sign next to the title
    -   Clicking on this warning leads to a screen that explains to user that this screen is provided by custom content
    -   It also gives the user an option to leave the current world to avoid them being locked in an infinite loop of dialogs
    -   If a new dialog is received by the client while warning screen is visible, it will not replace it, but when user clicks the "Back" button, the new dialog will be restored instead
-   Dialogs can be displayed by server in `play` and `configuration` connection phases
    -   However, only inline registries are allowed in `configuration`, since registries are not yet available in that phase
    -   Additionally, `run_command` click event is not available in `configuration` phase
-   Dialogs by default will close after the Escape key is pressed
    -   When this happens, dialog will run action specific to dialog type described as "exit action" below
    -   This behavior is configurable
-   When the dialog screen is closed, the game goes back to previously displayed non-dialog screen or back to gameplay
    -   That means that new dialogs always replace already opened ones, if any
-   Dialogs can be configured to be accessible from Pause menu
    -   This replaces and expands the "Server Links" button added in previous versions
-   New key bind called "Quick Actions" has been added to allow accessing content-configured dialogs
-   Most dialogs follow a common layout, however exact contents depend on type:
    -   Header with title and warning button
    -   Body elements, scrollable if needed:
        -   messages and items
        -   inputs
        -   actions buttons
    -   Optional footer, contains main buttons and submit actions

> **Developer's Note**: _Dialogs are not supposed to fully describe any in-game UI, but just to allow custom content to display simple messages and get input from users. This feature is intentionally limited to match that use case._

![An example of a custom Dialog screen.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/1.21.6customdialogscaled.jpg)

        -   only available if `pause` is `false` to avoid locking the game in single-player mode
    -   `wait_for_response` - replace the current dialog with a "Waiting for Response" screen
        -   this option is intended to prevent users from sending multiple actions on laggy connections
            -   servers are expected to eventually replace this screen with a new dialog
        -   to avoid accidental locking, a "Back" button will become active after 5 seconds
            -   clicking this button will continue as if the dialog was closed (i.e., game returns to the previous non-dialog screen, if any)

    -   `max_lines` - if present, limits maximum lines, optional positive integer
    -   `height` - height of input, optional integer in range `1` to `512`
        -   If this field is omitted, but `max_lines` is present, the height will be chosen to fit the maximum number of lines (but can't exceed `512`)
        -   If this and `max_lines` are both omitted, it will default to a height that fits 4 lines

**`minecraft:boolean`**

    -   `initial` - an optional boolean flag that selects initial option (only one option can have this be set to `true`)
    -   Additionally, the list might also contain a plain string - in that case it's equivalent to a single entry with field `id` set to that string and other fields set to default

**`minecraft:number_range`**

-   A slider for picking a numeric value out of some range

**Actions**

Dialogs have at least one action, presented to the user as a button. After every action dialog will always evaluate contents of `after_action` field (see above).

Fields:

-   `label` - a button label, text component
-   `tooltip` - an optional text component to display when the button is hovered or focused
-   `width` - the width of the button, integer from `1` to `1024` (inclusive) with default `150`
-   `action` - an action to perform when the button is clicked, optional object with fields:
    -   `type` - value from `minecraft:dialog_action_type` registry
    -   `<type-specific>` - see below, depends on `type`

**Static Dialog Action Types**

All existing `click_event` actions (except for `open_file`) are included as dialog action types.

Uses same format as `click_event` on text components (but with `action` replaced with `type`) For example, when using `show_dialog`, the entry for action button will look like this:

    {
        "label": "some label",
        "action": {
            "type": "show_dialog",
            "dialog": "some:id"
        }
    }
    

**`minecraft:dynamic/run_command` Action Type**

-   This action will build a `run_command` event using a provided macro template
-   The macro will be expanded with string values from inputs
    -   For example, if the macro template is `some_command $(some_input)`, the string value from input with `key` of `some_input` parameter will be used for the template expansion
    -   Inputs not used in macro will be ignored, while macro parameters not matching any inputs will be replaced with an empty string

Fields:

-   `template` - a string with a macro template to be interpreted as a command

**`minecraft:dynamic/custom` Action Type**

-   This method will build a `minecraft:custom` event using all input values
-   All input contents will be sent together inside a compound tag, with tag value of each input put under id from `key` field of that input
-   Additional static fields can be added to payload

Fields:

-   `additions` - fields to be added to payload, optional compound tag
-   `id` - namespaced ID

**Built-in Dialogs**

The built-in datapack contains some custom dialogs to provide customization of specific screens used by the client.

**`minecraft:server_links`**

-   Replacement for the previously existing "Server Links" screen
-   Meant to simplify migration for servers that previously used this feature

**`minecraft:custom_options`**

-   Shows contents of `minecraft:pause_screen_additions` tag (see below)
-   Allows the user to select a specific dialog if this tag contains multiple entries
-   Note: Since this tag is meant for interoperability, any content that replaces this dialog should be careful not to hide other dialog providers

**Dialog Command**

-   New command has been added to show dialog to clients

Syntax:

-   `dialog show <targets> <dialog>` - show dialog to player(s)
    -   `<targets>` - player name, UUID or a player selector
    -   `<dialog>` - a namespaced ID from `minecraft:dialog` registry or inline dialog value as described above
    -   Returns the number of players in `targets` argument
-   `dialog clear <targets>` - clean dialog for player(s), if they have any visible
    -   `<targets>` - player name, UUID or a player selector
    -   Returns the number of players in `targets` argument

**Pause Screen Configuration**

-   A data pack can request some of the available dialogs to be accessible from Pause screen
-   This feature replaces the "Server Links" button and is placed on Pause screen according to the same rules
-   Buttons leading to dialogs exposed in this way will use label described in `external_title` field
-   This feature is configured by `minecraft:pause_screen_additions` dialog tag:
    -   If this tag is not specified or is empty but the server has sent `server_links` packet, the tag will be handled as if it contained `minecraft:server_links` dialog
        -   Note: this matches previous Server Links feature behavior
        -   If this dialog is removed, the tag remains empty
    -   If this tag is still empty, the button will not be visible ("Send Feedback" and "Report Bugs" buttons are visible instead)
    -   If this tag has a single element, the pause screen button will lead directly to that dialog
    -   If this tag has multiple elements, the pause screen button will lead to a `minecraft:custom_options` dialog which (by default) lets user select one of the tag elements
        -   If this dialog is removed, the button is will not be visible

**Quick Actions Key Bind**

-   A new key bind has been added that allows users to access a set of dialogs
-   Default key: `G`
-   This feature is configured by `minecraft:quick_actions` dialog tag
    -   If this tag is empty, the key bind will do nothing
    -   If this tag has a single element, the key bind will open that dialog
    -   If this tag has multiple elements, the key bind will lead to `minecraft:quick_actions` dialog which (by default) lets user select one of the tag elements
        -   If this dialog is removed, the key bind will do nothing
-   This option is intended for use in custom content and by servers, so this tag is empty in the Vanilla pack

### Text Components

**Click Events**

-   Users will now be prompted for confirmation before executing a command from the `run_command` click action in books and chat if the command can't be parsed or requires elevated permissions (i.e., higher than 0)

**Added `minecraft:custom`**

-   A new click action called `minecraft:custom` has been added
    -   When user clicks a component with this click action, the client will send a dedicated packet `minecraft:custom_click_action` to a server
    -   The intended use is as an alternative for `run_command` to be used by modded servers without worrying about having to add custom commands
    -   This packet has no functionality on Vanilla servers
    -   Fields:
        -   `id` - namespaced ID
        -   `payload` - optional tag field

**Added `minecraft:show_dialog`**

-   A new action called `show_dialog` has been added
    -   When user clicks this component, a dialog will be opened for them
    -   Fields:
        -   `dialog` - a namespaced ID from `minecraft:dialog` registry or inline dialog value as described above

### Game Rules

**Added `locatorBar`**

-   Default is `true`: enabling the Locator Bar
-   Changing to `false` will remove all existing Waypoints from all players

### Attributes

**Added `camera_distance`**

-   Default value: `4.0`
-   Modifies the distance at which the camera is placed away from the player or spectated entity when in a third-person view
-   If the entity being ridden has a larger `camera_distance` attribute, that distance will be used
-   This distance is multiplied by the `scale` attribute to get a final target camera distance

**Added `waypoint_transmit_range` and `waypoint_receive_range`**

-   Default: `0.0`, Minimum: `0.0`, Maximum: `60000000.0`
    
-   Players have a default transmission and reception range of 60,000,000
    
-   Mobs with a transmission range above zero will send waypoint packets to nearby receivers that are within that range
    
-   Similarly, receivers only receive waypoints that are inside their reception range (and receive nothing if that range is zero) Examples:
    
-   `/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_transmit_range base set 0` will prevent a player from transmitting (hiding them)
    
-   `/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_transmit_range base set 80` will only let a player transmit up to 80 blocks (hiding them from players further than that)
    
-   `/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_receive_range base set 0` will prevent a player from receiving (turns off their Locator Bar)
    
-   `/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_receive_range base set 120` will only let a player see Locator Bar dots that are within 120 blocks (hiding all players further than that)
    

**Changed `flying_speed`**

-   The `flying_speed` attribute now also applies to Ghasts and Happy Ghasts

### Data Components

**`equippable` Item Component**

-   Added a new optional field: `can_be_sheared` (boolean)

    -   If not specified, it defaults to `false`
-   Added a new optional field: `shearing_sound` (sound event)
    -   It's a sound event that plays when the equippable item is sheared
    -   If not specified, it defaults to the `item.shears.snip` sound event

**`attribute_modifiers` Item Component**

-   Added an optional `display` field to `attribute_modifiers` entries
    -   There are 3 `display` types:

    -   Interacting with leashes or riding may change the home position of the mob

**`area_effect_cloud`**

-   The `Particle` field has been renamed to `custom_particle`, and now always functions as an exact override for the default colored `entity_effect` particle
    -   The field will not be written if no override is specified
    -   The color will no longer be inherited from the potion contents when specifying the `entity_effect` or `tinted_leaves` particle types

**`tnt`**
