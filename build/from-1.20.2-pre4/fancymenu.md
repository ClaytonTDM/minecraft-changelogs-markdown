Another pre-release this week with minor changes and some bug fixes.

## Recipe book search revert

We received a lot of great feedback on the changes to the Recipe Book search in the last pre-release, as well as a number of bugs. As we do not have time to address this feedback so close to release, we have reverted the change for now, but we may look into this again at a later time.

# Minecraft 1.20.2 Pre-Release 1

Are you pre-pared for Pre-release 1 of 1.20.2? Moving into pre-releases means that, moving forward, you won't see any significant changes besides bug fixes and tweaks until the next snapshot cycle. It also means that we will be releasing more frequently than just Wednesdays, so keep your eyes peeled! However, Pre-release 1 brings new changes to the 'Villager Trade Rebalance' experiment, updates to Recipe Book search, command changes, and a new game rule!

Happy crafting!

## Changes

-   The Recipe Book search has been updated with the following changes:
    -   The search will only match the beginning of any word in the item's name
        -   For example, searching for "tor" will still show Torch and Redstone Torch but not Daylight Detector anymore
    -   All recipes, including those that have not been unlocked, will now show up in search results
    -   This will enable experienced players to find the recipes they are looking for (even if it hasn't been unlocked yet) without overwhelming new players
-   Updated structure icons on explorer maps sold by Cartographers
-   When villagers unlock new trades, the order of those trades in the UI is now always random instead of sometimes being deterministic

## Technical Changes

-   The data pack version is now 18
-   Client options are now sent during the configuration network phase when joining a server

### Data Pack Version 18

This data pack version removes the recently introduced `execute if function` and `return run` functionality. Flaws with those commands (see bugs [MC-264595](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-264595), [MC-264699](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-264699) and [MC-264710](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-264710)) require some substantial changes to fix, which we do not want to make close to a release.

These commands will instead be reintroduced early in the next snapshot series when we can take the time to iterate on and test them together with pack makers.

-   Removed `execute if|unless function` command form
-   Removed `return run` command form
-   Numbers used as macro arguments are now always inserted without suffixes, regardless of numeric type
-   Added game rule `enderPearlsVanishOnDeath`, controlling whether thrown ender pearls vanish when the player that threw them dies (default `true`)

## Experimental Features

### Villager Trade Rebalance Part 2

This pre-release updates the Villager Trade Rebalance experiment. This experiment has no effect on normal worlds. If you want to try these changes, you must turn on the Feature Toggle in the Experiments Menu when creating a new world. You can find more information about Feature Toggles [here](https://www.minecraft.net/article/testing-new-minecraft-features/feature-toggles-java-edition).

Thank you to everyone that has sent in their suggestions and feedback regarding the experimental trade change! We are trying out these changes to rebalance the villager trade system and make it more fair and fun for everyone. However, these changes are not yet final, and they will stay as experimental features while we continue to work on them. We appreciate your feedback on these changes. Visit [this link](https://aka.ms/VillagerTradingFeedback) to share your thoughts! We have been following the discussions about the previous Librarian and Wandering Trader updates and look forward to seeing the conversation continue.

**Cartographer**

Before now, Cartographers only sold maps to the Ocean Monument and Woodland Mansion. In this experiment Cartographers can sell seven new maps as well. These new maps each point to a different village or structure and can be used to find seven different biomes. This will help players who want to quickly find a specific location without waiting until they come across it by chance.

Cartographers from different biomes will sell a different selection of maps. Starting from one village, it will be possible to find every other village type by following maps from village to village.

Cartographers now sell 7 new maps: Desert Village Map, Jungle Explorer Map, Plains Village Map, Savanna Village Map, Snow Village Map, Swamp Explorer Map, and Taiga Village Map.

**Armorer**

The Armorer's trades have been updated with many changes.

The biggest change is that buying diamond armor now requires paying a small amount of Diamonds as well as Emeralds. This is meant to make the Armorer's diamond armor trades less useful at the start of the game when players don't have any Diamonds, while still giving a powerful advantage to advanced players who have spent some time collecting Diamonds.

Early-game players will find Armorers useful as a great source of iron armor, Shields and Emeralds.

Other changes include:

-   Most master-level Armorers buy Iron Blocks (and pay very well for them)
-   Chainmail armor is exclusively sold by the secret Jungle and Swamp Armorers
-   The Savanna Armorer sells cursed diamond armor at reduced prices
-   The Taiga Armorer can swap one piece of diamond armor for another

**Structure Loot**

Certain Enchanted Books now have a high chance of generating in some structures:

-   Ancient Cities: Mending
-   Mineshafts: Efficiency (I to V)
-   Pillager Outposts: Quick Charge (I to III)
-   Desert Temples: Unbreaking (I to III)
-   Jungle Temples: Unbreaking (I to III)

# Minecraft 1.20.1 Release Candidate 1

# Minecraft 1.20 Release Candidate 1

We are now releasing the first, and hopefully only, release-candidate for 1.20, containing two bug fixes. If all goes well, no further changes will be made before the full release of Minecraft 1.20 on Wednesday next week.

Happy crafting!

## Fixed bugs in 1.20 Release Candidate 1

-   [MC-256477](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-256477) Knowledge books can't be placed in chiseled bookshelves
-   [MC-262853](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-262853) Pitcher plant breaks and floats when growing without enough light

---

# Minecraft 1.20 Pre-release 7

Pre-release 7 for Minecraft 1.20 is now available in the Minecraft Launcher. This pre-release adds validation of symbolic links and fixes a bug.

### Changes

To improve safety, the game will now detect symbolic links used inside world directory. For a detailed explanation, check our [help article](https://aka.ms/MinecraftSymLinks).

-   If the target of a symbolic link is not on the user-configured allow-list, the game will not proceed with loading the world
    -   Note: world directory itself can still be linked
-   The list of allowed symbolic link targets is stored in file `allowed_symlinks.txt` in client or server top directory
-   The file consists of entries (one per line) with following formats allowed:
    -   Lines starting with `#` are comments and are ignored
    -   `[type]pattern`, where `type` can be `glob`, `regex` or `prefix`
        -   `prefix` matches start of path with given pattern (so for `/test` paths `/test`, `/test/` and `/test/foo.txt` would match)
        -   `regex` matches regular expression against whole path
        -   `glob` uses OS-specific path matching mechanism (for example `*.txt` would usually match files with `txt` extension)
        -   Note: paths will use OS-specific separators
    -   `pattern`, which uses default `prefix` type

## Fixed bug in 1.20 Pre-release 7

-   [MC-257778](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-257778) Bamboo Mosaic Slabs and Stairs are not in the #slabs and #stairs block and item tags

---

# Minecraft 1.20 Pre-Release 6

The sixth pre-release of the 1.20 update is here, yet again containing more bug fixes.

Happy mining!

## Technical Changes

-   `"item": "minecraft:air"` can no longer be used in datapack recipes
-   Ingredients in array form are now also allowed in `smithing_trim` and `smithing_transform` recipes on fields `template`, `base` and `addition`
    -   Those fields also allow empty arrays, which signalize that slot needs to be left empty

### Loot tables

**Random sequences**

The ID of the random sequence is now an optional field. If no sequence name is given, loot is drawn using a non-deterministic random source.

## Fixed bugs in 1.20 Pre-Release 6

-   [MC-237042](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-237042) Killing players in the sneaking state that have their sneak option set to "Toggle" in their accessibility settings, results in other players not being able to see them in this state when they respawn
-   [MC-241326](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-241326) Thomas Guimbretière's name is listed twice and misspelt in the credits

# Minecraft 1.20 Pre-release 1 

It is now time for the first Pre-release for Minecraft 1.20: The Trails and Tales update!

From now on, you should mostly see bugs being fixed. In addition to that, pre-releases don't follow the regular snapshot cadence of releasing on Wednesdays, so keep an eye out for the next pre-release.

As always, a big thank you to the community for your feedback, bugs reported, and awesome ideas throughout the snapshot series. Let the pre-releases commence!

## Changes

-   Colored Wool, Carpets and Beds can now be dyed to any other color

## Technical Changes

-   Added new damage types: `outside_border` and `generic_kill`
-   Random sequences for loot tables are now deterministic
-   Changes in `server.properties` encoding
-   `string` data sources for the `data` command now accept negative boundaries, which are interpreted as index counted from the end of the string

### Damage Types

-   Players outside the world border are now hurt by the damage type `outside_border` instead of `in_wall`
-   Forcibly removing an entity using i.e. the `/kill` command now uses damage type `generic_kill` instead of `out_of_world`

### Loot Table Random Sequences

The game now uses named random sequences to deterministically produce loot for loot tables. Each random sequence produces a unique sequence based on the world seed and sequence ID, which means a loot table will produce the same results when ran with the same parameters in the same world.

The ID of the random sequence to use for a loot table is specified in a new field called `random_sequence`.

### `server.properties`

-   File is now read in UTF-8 initially, with previous encoding (ISO 8859-1/Latin 1) as a fallback
-   File is now written with UTF-8 encoding

# Minecraft 1.19.4 Release Candidate 3

A third Release Candidate is now available for Minecraft 1.19.4, fixing one issue in preparation for the full release of Minecraft 1.19.4 tomorrow.

Happy Crafting!

-   [MC-260901](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-260901) Guardians deal thorns damage even while their spikes are retracted

# Minecraft 1.19.4 Release Candidate 1

Here is the first (and hopefully last) release candidate for 1.19.4. Unless something critical pops up, no further changes will be made for the full release, which is planned for next week.

Happy mining!

## Technical Changes

Changes to display entity interpolation:

-   interpolation always starts at the beginning on client tick
-   field `interpolation_start` is replaced with `start_interpolation`, with a different meaning
-   `start_interpolation` describes amount of ticks from the start of next client tick after receiving an update to start of interpolation
    -   for example value `0` means that interpolation will start at the beginning of next client tick after receiving the update
-   `start_interpolation` is not stored in entity data
    -   when using data commands, if interpolated value is updated, but `start_interpolation` is not present in modified tag, interpolation will continue from the time of previous update, but with new values

## Fixed bugs in 1.19.4-rc1

-   [MC-260857](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-260857) Display entities summoned with initial transformation interpolate incorrectly from default transformation during next transformation

# Minecraft 1.19.4 Pre-Release 4

Happy mining!

## Changes

## Technical Changes

### Display entities

-   When a new interpolation is started, it now starts from the current state instead of the final state

## Changes to Experimental Features
