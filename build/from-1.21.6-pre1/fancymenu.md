# 1.21.6 Pre-Release 1

Hey! This is the first pre-release of 1.21.6. From now on, you will mostly see us fixing bugs and the release schedule might include more than one pre-release per week. We are on the finish line for the second drop of the year!

## Changes

-   The Dried Ghast Block now emits a vibration frequency of 11 when its block state changes
-   Shearing Saddles, Horse Armor, and Carpets now emits a vibration frequency of 6, along with the Unequip frequency of 4
-   The Ambient Dried Ghast sounds are now adjusted under the Blocks sound option instead of the Ambient/Environment option
-   A player riding a Happy Ghast can no longer completely fly through a Happy Ghast ridden by another player

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 79
-   The Resource Pack version is now 63

## Data Pack Version 79

-   Dialogs can now configure if they pause the game and if they close after an action is taken
-   Every dialog can now have inputs and can submit information
    -   The definition of actions has been changed to accommodate that
    -   The dedicated input dialog types have been removed, since they are redundant now
    -   The order of elements is:
        -   Body
        -   Inputs
        -   Actions
-   The `minecraft:custom` click event has been expanded to carry full a NBT tag
-   A new keybind called "Quick Actions" has been added to allow accessing content-configured dialogs

### Quick Actions Keybind

-   A new keybind has been addded that allows users to access a set of dialogs
-   Default key: `G`
-   This feature is configured by `minecraft:quick_actions` dialog tag
    -   If this tag is empty, the keybind does nothing
    -   If this tag has a single element, the keybind will open this dialog
    -   If this tag has multiple elements, the keybind will lead to `minecraft:quick_actions` dialog which (by default) lets user select one of the tag elements
        -   If this dialog is removed, the keybind does nothing
-   This option is intended to be used in custom content and by servers, so this tag is empty by default

### Common Dialog fields

New fields:

-   `pause` - if the dialog screen should pause the game in single-player mode, default: `true`
-   `after_action` - an additional operation performed on the dialog after click or submit actions, default: `close`
    -   `close` - closes the dialog and returns to the previous non-dialog screen (if any)
    -   `none` - does nothing, i.e. keeps the current dialog screen open
        -   only available if `pause` is `false` to avoid locking the game in single-player mode
    -   `wait_for_response` - replace the current dialog with a "Waiting for Response" screen
        -   this option is intended to prevent users from sending multiple actions on slow connections
            -   servers are expected to eventually replace this screen with a new dialog
        -   to avoid accidental locking, a "Back" button will become active after 5 seconds
            -   clicking this button will continue as if the dialog was closed (i.e. the game returns to the previous non-dialog screen, if any)
        -   The "Waiting for Response" screen will unpause the game in single-player mode to avoid locking the game

### Dialog Types

**Changed `minecraft:multi_action`, `minecraft:server_links`, `minecraft:dialog_list`**

-   Replaced field `on_cancel` with `exit_action`, holding an optional action
    -   If `exit_action` is present, a button for it will appear in footer, otherwise the footer is not present
    -   `exit_action` is also used for the Escape action

**Removed `minecraft:simple_input_form`**

-   Since any dialog can now have inputs, this dialog can be replaced by `minecraft:notice`

**Removed `minecraft:multi_action_input_form`**

-   Since any dialog can now have inputs, this dialog can be replaced by `minecraft:multi_action` (without any specified `exit_action`)

### Input Control Types

-   To accomodate the new `minecraft:custom` click event, all inputs will now return either a string or an NBT tag, depending on context

**`minecraft:text`**

-   Output values:
    -   As template substitution: contents without modification
    -   As tag: a string tag with contents without modification

**`minecraft:boolean`**

-   Output values:
    -   As template substitution: `on_true` when checked, `on_false` when unchecked
    -   As tag: `1b` when checked, `0b` when unchecked

**`minecraft:number_range`**

-   Output values:
    -   As template substitution: text representation of current value
        -   Whole numbers will be sent without decimal point
    -   As tag: a float tag with current value

**Dialog Body Types**

Hover and click events on text components within bodies now work as expected

-   Click events are handled by the dialog screen like any other action - that means it will also run the `after_action`

### Actions

-   The format of actions has been changed due to the merging of plain and input dialogs
-   After every action the dialog will always evaluate the contents of the `after_action` field (see above)

Fields:

-   Kept fields: `label`, `tooltip`, `width`
-   New field: `action` (replaces `on_click` and `on_submit`) - an action to perform when button is clicked, optional object with fields:
    -   `type` - value from `minecraft:dialog_action_type` registry
    -   `<type-specific>` - see below, depends on `type`

**Static Dialog Action Types**

All existing `click_event` actions (except for `open_file`) are included as dialog action types.

Uses same format as `click_event` on text components (but with `action` replaced with `type`) For example, when using `show_dialog`, entry for action button will look like:

    {
        "label": "some label",
        "action": {
            "type": "show_dialog",
            "dialog": "some:id"
        }
    }
    

**`minecraft:dynamic/run_command` Action Type**

-   This action will build a `run_command` event using a provided macro template
-   The macro will be expanded with string values from all inputs
    -   For example, if the macro template is `some_command $(some_input)`, the string value from the input with `key` of `some_input` will be used for the template expansion
    -   Inputs not used in macro will be ignored, while macro parameters not matching any inputs will be replaced with an empty string

Fields:

-   `template` - a string with a macro template to be interpreted as a command

**`minecraft:dynamic/custom` Action Type**

-   This method will build a `minecraft:custom` event using all input values
-   All input contents will be sent together inside a compound tag, with tag value of each input put under id from `key` field of that input
-   Additional static fields can be added to payload

Fields:

-   `additions` - fields to be added to payload, optional compound tag
-   `id` - namespaced ID

## Resource Pack version 63

-   Added `oversized_in_gui` item model field
-   Introduced new player head special model type

### Item Models

-   Item model definitions now have a boolean field `oversized_in_gui` which is `false` by default
    -   If `true`, the item model will be allowed to be bigger than its item slot
    -   If `false`, the item model will be clipped to the item slot size when being rendered in gui
    -   This ability of items being rendered outside their slots should not be considered officially supported, it was temporarily restored as an exception since many servers are relying on it
    -   At some point in the future we hope to replace it with an officially supported way of achieving similar functionality
-   Introduced new item model `minecraft:player_head` to handle player profile texture loading and rendering
-   Removed support for `minecraft:profile` from `minecraft:head`

**`minecraft:player_head` special model type**

-   Renders a player head
-   Uses profile from the `minecraft:profile` component to load a texture. Renders a default texture until the profile texture is fully loaded
-   No fields

**`minecraft:head` special model type**

-   No longer supports profile from `minecraft:profile` component to load a player texture
-   Renders a default player texture when `kind` is `player` and no texture override is supplied
-   Fields remain unchanged

-   Added `custom` - a new `click_event` action type for text components
-   Users will now be prompted for confirmation before executing a command from the `run_command` click action in books and chat if the command can't be parsed or requires elevated permissions (i.e. higher than 0)

### Dialogs

-   Added a way to display simple modal dialogs to a user
-   Dialogs are stored in a `minecraft:dialog` registry, but can also be defined inline
-   Dialogs are an experimental feature
-   To avoid user confusion, dialog screens are marked with a warning sign next to the title
    -   Clicking on this warning leads to a dialog that explains to user that this screen is provided by custom content
    -   It also gives user an option to leave current world to avoid them being locked in infinite loop of dialogs
-   Dialogs can be displayed by server in `play` and `configuration` connection phases
    -   However, only inline registries are allowed in `configuration`, since registries are not yet available in that phase
-   Dialogs always close after user selects any action
-   Dialogs by default will also close after Escape key is pressed
    -   When this happens, dialog will run action specific to dialog type described as "exit action" below
    -   This behavior is configurable
-   When dialog screen is closed, game goes back to previously displayed non-dialog screen or back to gameplay
    -   That means that new dialogs always replace already opened ones, if any
-   Dialogs screens will pause the game in singleplayer mode
-   Dialogs can be configured to be accessible from Pause menu
    -   This replaces and expands "Server Links" button added in previous versions
-   Most dialogs follow a common layout, however exact contents depend on type:
    -   Header with title and warning button
    -   Body elements (labels, inputs, buttons and submit actions), scrollable if needed
    -   Optional footer, contains main buttons and submit actions

> **Developer's Note**: _Dialogs are not supposed to fully describe any in-game UI, but just to allow custom content to display simple messages and get input from users. This feature is intentionally limited to match that use case._

**Dialog Description Format**

-   Dialogs are stored in `minecraft:dialog` registry that can be provided by a datapack

Fields:

-   `type` - one of dialog types from `minecraft:dialog_type` registry

**Built-in dialogs**

The built-in datapack contains some custom dialogs to provide customization of specific screens used by client

**`minecraft:server_links`**

-   Replacement for previously existing "Server Links" screen
-   Meant to simplify migration for servers that used this feature previously

**`minecraft:custom_options`**

-   Shows contents of `minecraft:pause_screen_additions` tag (see below)
-   Lets user select a specific dialog if this tag contains multiple entries
-   Note: Since this tag is meant for interoperability, any content that replaces this dialog should be careful to not hide other dialog providers

**Dialog Command**

-   New command has been added to show dialog to clients

Syntax:

-   `dialog show <targets> <dialog>` - show dialog to player(s)
    -   `<targets>` - player name, UUID or a player selector

**Pause Screen Configuration**

-   A data pack can request some of the available dialogs to be accessible from Pause screen
-   This feature replaces "Server Links" button and is placed on Pause screen according to the same rules
-   Buttons leading to dialogs exposed in this way will use label described in `external_title` field
-   This feature is configured by `minecraft:pause_screen_additions` dialog tag:
    -   If this tag is not specified or is empty but the server has sent `server_links` packet, tag will be handled as if it contained `minecraft:server_links` dialog
        -   Note: this matches previous Server Links feature behavior
        -   If this dialog is removed, the tag remains empty
    -   If this tag is still empty, button is not visible ("Send Feedback" and "Report Bugs" buttons are visible instead)
    -   If this tag has a single element, Pause screen button will lead directly to this dialog
    -   If this tag has multiple elements, Pause screen button will lead to `minecraft:custom_options` which (by default) lets user select one of the tag elements
        -   If this dialog is removed, button is not visible

### Text Components
