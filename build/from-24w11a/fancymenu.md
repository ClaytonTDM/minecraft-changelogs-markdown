# Minecraft Snapshot 24w11a

Oh look, it's a rare case of snapshot Thursday! This week we're expanding your arsenal with a smashing new weapon, the Mace! Use this weapon's special smash attack while leaping from a high place and watch your enemies get knocked back. The longer you fall, the harder you hit – but make sure you time it right! Your fall damage is only negated if you land the blow. Craft this new weapon by combining a Breeze Rod with the Heavy Core, a new item you can find by unlocking Trial Chamber Vaults.

As usual, we invite you to share your thoughts about this new feature over at the feedback site: [Let's talk about the Mace!](https://aka.ms/mcmacefeedback)

Alongside this hefty new mob swatter, we're also bringing you new chambers and variations to Trial Chambers, updated loot tables for Vaults, new Pottery Sherds, Armor Trims and Banner Patterns—as well as the usual slew of bug fixes and polish.

Happy mace-ing!

## Experimental Features

-   Added the Mace
-   Added Breeze Rod
-   Added Heavy Core
-   Added 2 new Armor Trims
-   Added 3 new Pottery Sherds
-   Added 2 new Banner Patterns
-   Updated Vault loot table
-   Updated Trial Chambers

## Blocks

### Heavy Core

-   A mysterious, dense block which can be combined with a Breeze Rod to craft a brand-new weapon: the Mace!

## Items

### Breeze Rod

-   An item dropped by the Breeze that can be crafted into 4 Wind Charges, or used with the Heavy Core to craft the Mace

### Mace

-   A new heavy weapon to smash your enemies!
-   Leverage the weight of this new weapon to deal additional damage the farther you fall before hitting your target
    -   Try it out by jumping down toward your target, and hit them before you hit the ground
    -   Successfully striking a target in this way will negate any damage accumulated from the fall, similar to how a Wind Charge works
    -   Other entities near the struck enemy will be knocked back by the immense force of the Mace
-   Using a Mace will decrease its durability like any other weapon; repair it with Breeze Rods at an anvil
-   Players can use a Mace in combination with Wind Charges to launch up and deliver devastating smash attacks on their enemies

## Mobs

### Breeze

-   Drops 1-2 Breeze Rods when killed by a player
    -   The number of Breeze Rods dropped is affected by looting enchantments

-   Flow can be duplicated using a Breeze Rod

### Trial Chambers

-   Added new chambers and variations, with new challenges

    -   Remade chamber;;_;;3, and renamed it to "pedestal"
-   Added Flow, Guster, and Scrape Pottery Sherds to the Decorated Pots in the decor structure pool
-   Trial Spawners will now appear more frequently in the corridors
-   Changed the layout of the blocks around the Vaults
-   The loot tables of Vaults in Trial Chambers have been updated to address some inventory management issues
    -   You will now get no more than 1 unstackable item per Vault
    -   You will more often get rewards which can stack together
    -   Horse Armor and Saddles have been removed from the loot table

-   Status effect particle colors are no longer blended into one particle color
    -   All active visible status effect particles are now rendered separately
    -   The frequency of emitting status effect particles has been lowered to clutter the screen less
-   Updated the wolf armor crack textures
-   Menu background blur has been updated to look better and be more performant

### Wolf variants

When summon in other ways (e.g. using the Spawn Egg or using the `summon` command), the variant selection follows the natural spawning biome rules with the following extensions:

-   Rusty Wolf: will be selected in all Jungle biomes, including Jungle and Bamboo Jungle Biomes
-   Spotted Wolf: will be selected in all Savanna biomes, including Savanna and Windswept Savanna Biomes
-   Striped Wolf: will be selected in all Badlands biomes, including Badlands and Eroded Badlands Biomes

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 35
-   The Resource Pack version is now 29

## Data Pack Version 35

-   Removed `any` entity sub-predicate
-   Component-specific item predicate properties have been moved to separate field `predicates`
-   Added slot name `contents` for single-slot entities like item frames and item displays
-   Contents of `item` entity can now be accessed through `contents` slot name
-   Added new loot functions

### Predicates

**Item sub-predicate**

-   Some fields from item predicate have been moved to a map in an optional field `predicates`
-   The new field is similar to the `components` field on item stacks
-   This was done to simplify addition for future predicates and to allow sub-predicates to more closely resemble names of components they match
-   The following fields have been moved:
    -   `enchantments` - field moved to sub-predicate `minecraft:enchantments`
    -   `stored_enchantments` - field moved to sub-predicate `minecraft:stored_enchantments`
    -   `potions` - field moved to sub-predicate `minecraft:potion_contents`
    -   `custom_data` - field moved to sub-predicate `minecraft:custom_data`
-   `durability` field has been expanded to `minecraft:damage` predicate:
    -   This check now works for any item that has `minecraft:damage` component
    -   An item that does not have a `minecraft:damage` component can never match
    -   To check for unbreakable items, query value of `minecraft:unbreakable` component
    -   Fields:
        -   `damage` - optional bounds for value of `minecraft:damage` component
        -   `durability` - optional bounds for durability (max damage minus value of `minecraft:damage`)
-   Predicates `minecraft:enchantments`, `minecraft:stored_enchantments`, `minecraft:potion_contents` and `minecraft:damage` require matching component to exist on item
    -   That means that, for example, matching for empty enchantment list will not pass on items without `minecraft:damage` component
    -   Note: some components, like `minecraft:enchantments` have default values, so they will always match

**Example:**

Before:

    "item": {
      "enchantments": [
        {
          "enchantment": "minecraft:silk_touch",
          "levels": {
            "min": 1
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    

After:

    "item": {
      "predicates": {
        "minecraft:enchantments": [
            {
              "enchantment": "minecraft:silk_touch",
              "levels": {
                "min": 1
              }
            }
          ]
      }
    }

# Minecraft Snapshot 24w10a

Woah, another snapshot day of the Wednesday variant! Today we are releasing 24w10a, featuring new Wolf Variants, some new Data Pack features, and lots of bug fixes.

Happy mining!

## New Features

-   Added variants of Wolves

### Wolf variants

-   New Wolf variants have been added
-   The variant is determined by the biome they spawn in
    -   Pale Wolf - The familiar Wolf variant that now spawns in the Taiga biome, with a default pack size of 4
    -   Woods Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Forest biome. This will be the dominant Wolf variant that you will be able to find in the Overworld, since the Forest biome is very common
    -   Ashen Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Snowy Taiga biome
    -   Black Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Old Growth Pine Taiga biome, in smaller packs of 2 to 4
    -   Chestnut Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Old Growth Spruce Taiga biome, in smaller packs of 2 to 4
    -   Rusty Wolf - A variant that spawns in a new location for wolves - the Sparse Jungle biome, in smaller packs of 2 to 4
    -   Spotted Wolf - A variant that spawns in a new location for wolves - the Savanna Plateau biome, in larger packs of 4 to 8
    -   Striped Wolf - A variant that spawns in a new location for wolves, the Wooded Badlands biome, in larger packs of 4 to 8
    -   Snowy Wolf - A variant that spawns in the Grove biome. A rare type, that always walks alone
-   Adjusted spawning conditions for Wolves, allowing them to spawn on Coarse Dirt and Podzol blocks

## Changes

-   Adjusted passive mobs spawning in Grove biome to only include Rabbits, Foxes and Wolves
-   Button tooltips will no longer appear when hovering outside the containing element

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 34

## Data Pack Version 34

-   Recipe results can now specify component data
-   Added new entity predicate field `slots`, for matching item slots
-   Added slot names for ranges, like `container.*`
-   Added `execute if|unless items` to check and count items
-   Banner Patterns are now data-driven
-   Changes to Item Stack Component formats
-   Player Head blocks now store a `custom_name` tag, which will be copied to and from the item form when broken or placed
-   The `SkullOwner` and `ExtraType` fields in Player Head blocks have been replaced with a `profile` field, with the same format as the item component
-   For now, the `count` field on Item Stacks is always stored again, even if `1`
    -   If the field is missing in data, will still fall back to `1`

### Recipes

-   Recipe types `crafting_shaped`, `crafting_shapeless`, `stonecutting` and `smithing_transform` now accept `components` for the `result` item stack
-   The `result` field for recipe types `smelting`, `blasting`, `smoking` and `campfire_cooking` is now an item stack format without a count, which means you'll need to specify an object with an `id` field
    -   This `result` now also accepts `components` data

### Predicates

**`slots` entity sub-predicate**

-   New entity field `slots` allows to check single or multiple slots on any entity
-   The field contains a map of slot names (same as ones used in `item` commands) to item predicate
-   For slot ranges, only one slot needs to match for whole entry to pass

Example:

    {
        "condition": "minecraft:entity_properties",
        "entity": "this",
        "predicate": {
            "slots": {
                "container.*": {
                    "items": "dirt"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    

### Slot names

-   Slot names (used in `item` commands and `slots` entity predicates) now include slot ranges
-   Unless specified, existing commands can still only work on single slots
-   New slot names:
    -   `container.*` - contains `container.0` to `container.53`
    -   `hotbar.*` - contains `hotbar.0` to `hotbar.8`
    -   `inventory.*` - contains `inventory.0` to `inventory.26`
    -   `enderchest.*` - contains `enderchest.0` to `enderchest.26`
    -   `villager.*` - contains `villager.0` to `villager.7`
    -   `horse.*` - contains `horse.0` to `horse.14`
    -   `weapon.*` - contains `weapon.mainhand` and `weapon.offhand`
    -   `armor.*` - contains `armor.head`, `armor.chest`, `armor.legs`, `armor.feed`, `armor.body`
    -   `player.cursor` - item held by player on screen
        -   Note: this information is not available in creative mode
    -   `player.crafting.0` - `player.crafting.3`, `player.crafting.*` - player's crafting slots
        -   Note: this includes only player's inventory crafting slots. Crafting table (or any other slots on other screens) are not included

**`execute if|unless items`**

-   `execute if|unless items <source> <slots> <item_predicate>` command can be used to count items
    -   `<source>` is the same as one used in `item` command, i.e.
        -   `block <x> <y> <z>`
        -   `entity <target>` (selector can return multiple entities)
    -   `<slots>` can accept single slot (like `container.0`) or a range (like `container.*`)
    -   `<item_predicate>` is the same as item predicate in `clear` command
-   If used alone, it will return total number of items in stacks that match predicates

### Banner Patterns

-   Banner Patterns will now be loaded into a dynamic registry from data packs (`data/<namespace>/banner_pattern/<id>`)
    -   These entries have two fields:
        -   `asset_id` (namespaced string) is used to resolve texture locations
            -   e.g. `custom:pattern` resolves to `assets/custom/textures/entity/banner/pattern.png`, `assets/custom/textures/entity/shield/pattern.png`
        -   `translation_key` (string) is a translation key prefix
            -   e.g. `block.minecraft.banner.custom.pattern` resolves to `block.minecraft.banner.custom.pattern.<dye color>`

### Item Stack Components

-   The `minecraft:profile` component no longer requires the `name` field to be present
-   Some additional Item Stack Components now support alternative, simple definitions:
    -   `minecraft:profile` can be defined as string player name (e.g. `profile="jeb_"`)
    -   `minecraft:dyed_color` can be defined as an integer rgb color (e.g. `dyed_color=16711680`)
    -   `minecraft:attribute_modifiers` can be defined as a direct list of modifiers (e.g. `attribute_modifiers=[{type:'generic.scale',uuid:[1,2,3,4],name:'Big!',amount:1.0,operation:'add_multiplied_base'}]`)
    -   `minecraft:potion_contents` can be defined as a single potion id (e.g. `potion_contents="invisibility"`)
    -   `minecraft:enchantments` and `minecraft:stored_enchantments` can be defined as an inline map of enchantment id to level (e.g. `enchantments={sharpness:1}`)
    -   These are only an alternative for defining the values, they will always be stored in their full formats
-   All container blocks now use the `minecraft:container` component when in item form, not just Shulker Boxes
