Hi everyone! We're back with yet another snapshot for 1.20.5, which includes a collection of technical changes, bug fixes and a new experimental feature for Trial Chambers, the Vault Block!

We're very interested in hearing your feedback on this new feature over at the feedback site: [Let's talk about Vaults!](https://aka.ms/mcvaultsfeedback)

Happy looting!

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 30
-   The Resource Pack version is now 25
-   Added a reserved region file compression id for third-party servers to use for custom compression implementations
-   Added an option to not compress region files
-   Allowed server operators to view dedicated server TPS debug chart

### Region file compression algorithm

-   Added a third value to the dedicated server configuration property `region-file-compression`:
    -   `none` does not compress the data. Consumes significantly more space and requires significant time to read and write, even though CPU is used less. Might make sense together with filesystem level compression

### Reserved compression id for third-party servers

-   Compression id `127` can now be used for custom implementations of region file compression
-   When used, the version id must be followed by a namespaced string representing the custom algorithm used

## Data Pack Version 30

-   Potion effects stored in items or entities will no longer encode their default values
    -   `amplifier`: `0`
    -   `duration`: `0`
    -   `ambient`: `false`
    -   `show_particles`: `true`
-   Added `body_armor_item` and `body_armor_drop_chance` to all entities that currently have `HandItems` and `ArmorItems`, and handle the same way as `HandItems` and `ArmorItems`
-   Handling of Horses `ArmorItem`, Llamas `DecorItem`, and Wolf's `armor` has been changed to use `body_armod_item` and `body_armor_drop_chance` instead
-   In commands, removed `horse.armor` slot argument, and added instead `armor.body` slot argument, applicable now to all mobs
-   Added `vault_connection` particle
-   Added Vault block with a variety of NBT elements which can be configured for custom content
    -   `config`
        -   `loot_table` The loot table that will be ejected upon being unlocked
            -   Default value: `"minecraft:chests/trial_chambers/reward"`
        -   `activation_range` The range any player who hasn't unlocked the Vault must be within for it to open its keyhole
            -   Default value: `4`
        -   `deactivation_range` The range all viable players must be outside of for the Vault to close its keyhole
            -   Default value: `4.5`
        -   `key_item` An itemstack that is required to unlock the Vault
            -   NBT and stack count is used for comparison
            -   Default value: `"minecraft:trial_key"`
        -   `override_loot_table_to_display` An optional loot table which will be used for displaying items inside the cage instead of results from the config's `loot_table`
            -   Default value: No value
    -   `shared_data`
        -   `connected_particles_range` The range players who have not unlocked the Vault must be within before particles will flow from them
            -   Default value: `4.5`

## Resource Pack Version 25

-   The unused attributes array in core shader definitions has been removed
-   The unused `position_color_normal` and `position_tex_lightmap_color` shaders have been removed
-   The `position_tex_color_normal` shader (only used by clouds) has been replaced by `rendertype_clouds`
-   The `IViewRotMat` uniform has been removed, and the `Position` attribute for entities is now in (camera relative) world space
-   Light direction uniforms are no longer premultiplied by the view matrix
-   Added texture and model files for Vault block
-   Changed texture for the Trial Key item
-   Added texture and particle file for `vault_connection` particle

## Experimental Features

-   Added Vault block

### Vault

-   A block that holds locked treasure and loot - find the right key to eject its rewards
    -   Found throughout Trial Chambers, containing the structures' most valuable loot
    -   Vaults in Trial Chambers require a Trial Key to be unlocked
-   Can be unlocked by an unlimited amount of players
    -   After a player has unlocked a Vault, they cannot unlock that Vault again
    -   If a player has not unlocked that Vault before, an orange stream of particles will flow from the player to the Vault when nearby
-   Has a keyhole that will be open or closed depending on the players nearby
    -   If any nearby player has not unlocked that Vault, the keyhole will be open
    -   If all nearby players have unlocked that Vault, the keyhole will be closed
-   Within its cage, it will cycle through and display items which are possible to eject from its loot table
-   The rewards it ejects are randomized from its loot table each time it is unlocked
-   Cannot be crafted or obtained in Survival, and does not drop anything when mined
-   Explosion-resistant and cannot be moved
-   Vaults currently reuse the same loot table that reward chests previously used in the Trial Chambers
    -   This loot table is temporary and will be completely revised as development continues

### Trial Key

-   Updated texture to reflect new Vault visuals

## Fixed bugs in Snapshot 24w05a

-   [MC-225170](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-225170) Normal matrix scaling broken in some situations
-   [MC-260099](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-260099) Sniffer's snout shading changes during sniffing
-   [MC-264821](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-264821) The fog on armor worn by entities occurs too early
-   [MC-267922](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-267922) Wolf armor loses custom display name and other NBT when equipped

Hello again! Here is another snapshot bringing you some Armadillo changes, experimental feature changes, and a bunch of technical changes. We have some server-side performance improvements and improved debug tools along with a new `transfer` command. Enjoy!

## Changes

-   Armadillo now also rolls up when it detects a mob, or a player that has attacked it recently
-   When an Armadillo is in rolled up state, its shell will protect it, and reduce the damage dealt to it, even allowing it to fully resist weak attacks
-   Renamed "Allow cheats" to "Allow commands"

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 29
-   Added an option to use a faster region file compression algorithm on dedicated servers
-   Introduced changes to optimizing worlds
-   Improved server TPS debug chart
-   Reduced time needed to generate explorer maps to buried treasures

### Region file compression algorithm

-   Added a dedicated server configuration property `region-file-compression` with 2 possible values:
    -   `deflate`, the default option. Uses the old algorithm
    -   `lz4` uses LZ4 algorithm, which requires less CPU time to compress and decompress but uses more disk space
-   Changing the compression algorithm will not automatically recompress the world
    -   New or updated chunks will use the newly configured algorithm, but the old ones will stay in the previous format

### World optimizing changes

-   Optimizing singleplayer worlds and running dedicated server with `forceUpgrade` now also upgrades contents of `entities` and `poi` directories of the world
-   New `recreateRegionFiles` dedicated server startup parameter
    -   It will trigger world optimization similar to `forceUpgrade`, but will also rewrite all the chunks independently of whether they have been upgraded
    -   This will create fresh and defragmented region files
    -   Using this parameter after changing the `region-file-compression` server property will recompress all region files in the new format

### Improved the server TPS debug chart

-   As before, it is accessible by pressing `F3 + 2` in a Singleplayer world
-   The bottom dark red section of the chart displays the time spent during the main logic of the server tick. It is equivalent to the value diplayed in the old chart
-   The light brown section displays time spent on running scheduled tasks
-   The purple section displays time spent executing all other code during the tick
-   The top light green (or yellow or red depending on lag) section displays time spent idling, waiting for next tick
-   The `min`, `avg`, `max` aggregate values are based on the sum of the first 3 sections

## Data Pack Version 29

-   Added the `transfer` command

### `transfer` Command

New command that triggers a transfer of a player to another server. Only exists on dedicated servers.

Syntax:

`transfer <hostname> [<port>] [<players>]`

Parameters:

-   `hostname`: String describing the hostname of the server to connect to
-   `port`: Integer denoting the port number of the server to connect to - if omitted, 25565 is used
-   `players`: The players to transfer - if omitted, `@s` is used

## Experimental Features

### Breeze

-   Breeze is now aggressive toward Iron Golems in addition to players
-   Breeze no longer retaliates against attacks from the following mobs: Skeletons, Strays, Zombies, Husks, Spiders, Cave Spiders, Slimes
-   The above mobs will not retaliate when hurt by the Breeze's Wind Charge Projectile

### Copper Grates

-   Stonecutting Copper Blocks into Copper Grates outputs 4 Copper Grates

## Fixed bugs in Snapshot 24w04a

-   [MC-232489](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-232489) Retrieving a plant from a flower pot ignores inventory contents
-   [MC-266449](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-266449) Breeze doesn't attack or retaliate against mob on sight
-   [MC-266707](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-266707) Trial spawners ignore custom;;_;;spawn;;_;;rules
-   [MC-267925](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-267925) Retrieving an item from a flower pot while holding something causes the item to end up in your off hand
-   [MC-267937](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-267937) Shooting a breeze with a piercing crossbow makes the game crash
-   [MC-267938](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-267938) The world loading percentage value can get covered by the spawn chunk loading animation when the "spawnChunkRadius" gamerule is set to large values
-   [MC-267941](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-267941) The end portal kills mobs at spawnChunkRadius 0
-   [MC-267953](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-267953) No element is focused when opening the realms world backups menu using keyboard navigation

### Breeze

-   Updated the model, texture, and animation of the Wind Charge projectile to give it a more dynamic look and feel

## Fixed bugs in Snapshot 24w03b

-   [MC-266032](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-266032) Attempting to copy a "Copy of a copy" book in a Crafter behaves incorrectly
-   [MC-266577](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-266577) Some trial spawners in trial chambers spawn mobs without persistence

New year, new Snapshot - we're now releasing the third Snapshot of Minecraft 1.20.5. This time around, we're bringing some updates to the Armadillo, the Breeze, as well as accessibility improvements.

In addition to a big bundle of bug fixes, we're bringing some changes to how spawn chunks are handled.

The spawn chunks are an area of the Overworld located at the world spawn which are always loaded in memory. These are useful for some players but use more of your computer’s resources and make the game load and run more slowly. (You can read more about spawn chunks at the [community wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Spawn_chunk)!)

In this snapshot we made the size of the spawn chunks configurable by adding a new gamerule: `spawnChunkRadius`. The new default setting is 2 (which creates a 48x48 block area). This is 98% smaller than the previous area and will result in a noticeable performance improvement for most players.

If you would like to keep your spawn chunks working like they did before, you can use the game rule to change the spawn chunk radius value to 10. This will make your spawn chunks work the same as they did before, but you will miss out on the performance gains.

We're interested in hearing your feedback on this change and how the new default setting affects you.

[Let's talk about spawn chunks!](https://aka.ms/spawnchunksfeedback)

## New Features

### Armadillo

Armadillo visual update! We gathered feedback from the first Armadillo snapshot, and the next step in the look of the Armadillo, the Armadillo Scutes and the Wolf Armor are now here.

-   Armadillos now also spawn in Badlands

#### Armadillo Rolling Up Behavior

-   Spiders and Cave Spiders will run away from Armadillos not in a rolled up state

## Changes

-   Adjusted the texture of the Wolf Collar layer to be more consistent with the new Wolf Armor

### Accessibility

-   The default focus is now always set when entering or exiting any menu while navigating using tab or arrow keys

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 28
-   The Resource Pack version is now 24
-   Custom Villager trades can be configured to accept items that have different tags from the expected item by adding `ignoreTags: true` in the trade's NBT
-   When entities leave or enter the end the area they arrive in will now stay loaded for 15 seconds, matching the behavior of nether portals
-   Added transfer packets
-   Added cookie packets
-   Decreased the default size of the spawn chunks and made the value configurable

### Transfer Packets

-   Custom servers can now request that clients connect to another server with a new packet
-   When a client is transferred it will connect to the target server with a new transfer intent (id 3)
-   By default servers will not accept incoming transfers and will disconnect the client
-   This can be changed by setting the `accepts-transfers` property to `true` in the `server.properties` file
-   Resource packs are maintained across transfers
-   In the case of a transfer custom servers can skip authentication with a new flag

### Cookie Packets

-   Cookie packets allow custom servers to request and store data on a client
    -   Each cookie may be up to 5 KiB in size
    -   Cookies may be requested during login, configuration and play phases — but only stored during the configuration and play phases
-   Cookies are persisted across server transfers but are not persisted when the player disconnects
    -   This allows servers to pass along information such as authentication or custom game data to the new server

### Spawn Chunk Changes

-   The size of the spawn chunks changed from radius 10 (19x19 entity ticking chunks) to radius 2 (3x3 entity ticking chunks)
    -   This was done to reduce memory usage, loading times and CPU usage
    -   We opted to not fully remove spawn chunks to allow players who currently utilize this functionality to continue to do so
-   Added a new gamerule `spawnChunkRadius` to set the size of the spawn chunks
    -   Possible values are 0 to 32, where 0 completely disables the spawn chunks and 10 is equivalent to the functionality before this change
    -   Default value is 2, equivalent to 3x3 entity ticking chunks

## Data Pack Version 28

-   The `minecraft:sweeping` enchantment has been renamed to `minecraft:sweeping_edge`
-   Added Advancement Criteria trigger `default_block_use` which triggers due to the default interaction of a block by a player, such as opening a door
-   Added Advancement Criteria trigger `any_block_use` which triggers due to any type of interaction with a block by a player, such as using an item on the block or its default usage

### Tags

#### Item Tags

New item tags controlling what enchantments can be added to what gear:

-   `minecraft:enchantable/foot_armor`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/leg_armor`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/chest_armor`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/head_armor`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/armor`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/weapon`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/sword`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/mining`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/mining_loot`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/fishing`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/trident`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/durability`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/bow`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/equippable`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/crossbow`
-   `minecraft:enchantable/vanishing`

#### Entity Type Tags:

-   Added `minecraft:ignores_poison_and_regen` for entities that cannot be affected by Poison and Regeneration effects
-   Added `minecraft:illager_friends` for entities that Illagers will consider allies (unless on a different team)
-   Added `minecraft:inverted_healing_and_harm` for entities that have inverted meanings of the Healing and Harm effects
-   Added `minecraft:not_scary_for_pufferfish` for entities that will not cause Pufferfish to puff
-   Added `minecraft:sensitive_to_bane_of_arthropods` for entities sensitive to Bane of Arthropods
-   Added `minecraft:sensitive_to_impaling` for entities sensitive to Impaling
-   Added `minecraft:wither_friends` for entities that the Wither will not target and which cannot harm the Wither

## Resource Pack 24

-   The `ttf` font provider transforms have been adjusted to have more reasonable defaults
    -   `shift` is no longer applied double, and now directly represents a number of pixels in the game UI
    -   The font EM square is fitted to `size` pixels in the game UI, instead of between the font ascender and font descender
    -   The font baseline is positioned consistently with the default font (7 pixels below line top)
    -   This means that generally, any font with a `size` of 9 and no `shift` should look correct by default

## Experimental Features

### Breeze

-   Breeze now deflects all projectiles
-   Deflected projectiles now deflect in the direction of the shooter

### Trade Rebalance

-   In the Trade Rebalance Experiment, Villagers who buy armor now ignore durability and can buy damaged armor

Coming in hot, here is Snapshot 23w51b, fixing a crash in 23w51a.

## Fixed bugs in 23w51b

-   Fixed a crash that would occur when the nametag of a player was visible during sleeping, swimming or dying

---

We're now releasing Snapshot 23w51a, the first snapshot for Minecraft 1.20.5. This one comes with a present for your pet Wolf in time for the holidays - and the Armadillo.

Happy brushing!

## New Features

-   Added Armadillo, Armadillo Scutes and Wolf Armor

### Armadillo

-   The Armadillo is a new passive mob that:
    -   drops Armadillo Scutes periodically
    -   drops Armadillo Scutes when brushed
    -   spawns in Savannas
    -   its favorite food is Spider Eye

#### Armadillo Rolling Up Behavior

-   Armadillo rolls up when it detects a threat such as:
    -   a sprinting player
    -   a player in a vehicle or mounted
    -   undead mobs
-   It does not roll up when:
    -   it is fleeing
    -   in water
    -   in the air or
    -   on a leash
-   When an Armadillo is rolled up it does not walk, cannot eat, and will not be tempted by food
    -   It will continue to scan for threats: if none are detected for 3 seconds, it will unroll

#### Armadillo Scutes

-   Armadillo Scutes can be used to craft Wolf Armor
-   They are dropped by Armadillos
-   Dispensers can be used to brush Armadillo Scutes off Armadillos

### Wolf Armor

-   Using Wolf Armor on an adult tamed Wolf will equip the armor on the wolf.
-   Only a Wolf's owner can put a Wolf Armor on their tamed Wolf, and with this in mind; Dispensers cannot put Wolf Armor on wolves.
-   Wolf Armor gives the same protection as Diamond Horse Armor.
-   Using Shears on a Wolf that is wearing armor will make it drop the armor
-   Only a Wolf's owner can shear a Wolf Armor from it, and with this in mind; Dispensers cannot remove Wolf Armor from wolves.
-   If a Wolf dies while wearing armor, it will drop the armor.

## Changes

-   Renamed scutes that come from Turtles to Turtle Scutes
-   Llamas and Shulkers are no longer able to destroy armor stands

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 27

## Data Pack 27

-   Llamas now use a new damage type `spit` instead of `mob_projectile`
-   `FactorCalculationData` has been removed from mob effect instance tags
-   Added `generic.scale` attribute that can be used to rescale any living entity
-   Player reach distance can now be controlled with the `generic.block_interaction_range` and `generic.entity_interaction_range` attributes
-   The maximum number of blocks that an entity can step up without jumping is now controlled by the `generic.step_height` attribute

## Experimental Features

### Breeze

-   Added a new 'whirl' idle sound
-   Added a 'charging up attack' sound
-   Added a sound that plays while the Breeze is in the air
-   Added a projectile deflection sound
-   Tweaked existing sounds

### Trial Spawner

-   The Trial Spawner now has the same two default loot tables as they have in the Trial Chamber

This snapshot brings about a few redstone-focused changes. Notably, we’re tweaking the tick delay behavior of the crafter and the copper bulb while they’re still in experimental development.

With these changes, we aim to make the crafter more consistent with other blocks that drop or eject items, and the copper bulb with other blocks that react or change state when a connected redstone signal changes. As a result of this, some contraptions built during the last few snapshots may no longer work properly.

We're really excited about the tinkering opportunities both these new redstone blocks bring to the world. Please keep sending all your thoughts about them to Minecraft Feedback so we can keep building Minecraft together!

Enjoy!

## Changes

-   Updated Crafter textures

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 25

## Data Pack Version 25

-   Added individual display names for scoreboard entries

### Commands

#### `scoreboard`

##### Display names

-   Each entry in a scoreboard can now have a custom display name
-   Those values are kept separate per objective and score holder
-   If the name is not present, the score holder name is used (i.e. the old behavior)
-   If the score is reset or the whole objective is removed, the name is not preserved
-   Team decorations will still be applied to names as normal
-   Subcommands for managing names:
    -   `scoreboard players display name <targets> <objective> <text component>` - set display name
    -   `scoreboard players display name <targets> <objective>` - clear display name

##### Display name auto-update

-   To make display name management easier, objectives can also be configured to auto-update display names on every score update
-   This option is disabled by default
-   If a score holder has no display name (because it can't be attributed to any currently loaded entity), the current name is preserved
-   Command to control auto-update for objective:
    -   `scoreboard objectives modify <scoreboard> displayautoupdate [true|false]`

##### Number formatting

-   Scores in numeric form can now be formatted
-   Formats can be set for both objectives and individual scores
-   Scores with set formats will render the same in all context (sidebar, under player name, etc.)
-   Subcommands for managing formats:
    -   `scoreboard objectives modify <objective> numberformat <format>` - for setting default format for an objective
    -   `scoreboard objectives modify <objective> numberformat` - for clearing default format for an objective
    -   `scoreboard players display numberformat <targets> <score> <format>` - for setting format for a specific score holder
    -   `scoreboard players display numberformat <targets> <score>` - for clearing format for a specific score holder

Formats:

-   `styled <style>` - score will be displayed with selected style (like `{"bold":true}`)
-   `fixed <text component>` - score will be replaced with text
-   `blank` - score will not be displayed

We're happy to share another snapshot, this time offering an early look at some exciting new adventures waiting for you underground in the form of Trial Chambers!

Trial Chambers are designed to be challenging moments of combat and exploration hidden medium-deep below the surface of the Overworld. Trial Chambers bring new decorative and lighting blocks, new Trial Spawners to deliver a different style of multi-mob fights, and the bushy-browed Breeze, a new mob specific to Trial Chambers which will add quite a bit of chaos to your combats.

Happy Mining!

## Changes

-   Monster Spawner now renders their inner faces when looking inside

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 24
-   The Resource Pack version is now 21

## Data Pack Version 24

-   Added experimental Breeze mob
-   Added experimental Trial Spawner block
-   Increased maximum value of Jigsaw structure variable `size` from 7 to 20
-   Added `trial_chambers_copper_bulb_degradation` structure processor list

## Resource Pack Version 21

-   `uniform` font has been updated to use Unifont 15.1.04 (from 15.0.06)
-   The only supported texture format is now .png

### Breeze Mob

-   Added entity models and textures for experimental Breeze mob:
    -   `breeze`, `wind_charge`
-   Added shader:
    -   `breeze_wind`

## Experimental Features

### Added Breeze mob

-   The Breeze is a cunning, hostile mob that can spawn via Trial Spawner in some rooms within the Trial Chambers
-   The Breeze moves primarily by leaping around the target, sometimes jumping quite long distances
-   An aggressive adversary, the Breeze shoots volatile wind energy in the form of wind charge projectiles at its target
-   Wind charges deal a small amount of damage when colliding directly with an entity
-   After colliding with an entity or a block, wind charge projectiles produce a wind burst, which knocks back entities in the area by several blocks
-   Wind bursts also have the effect of 'activating' certain blocks:
    -   Non-Iron Doors and Trapdoors are flipped
    -   Fence Gates are flipped
    -   Buttons are pressed
    -   Levers are flipped
    -   Bells are rung and swung
    -   Lit Candles (both standalone and on cake) are extinguished
-   Wind bursts do not have any effect on Iron Doors, Iron Trapdoors, or any block being held in its position by a Redstone signal

### Trial Spawner

-   Trial Spawner is a new variant of Monster Spawners that ejects rewards upon completion and can have variable levels of challenge in multiplayer
-   The challenge level will increase for each new player a Trial Spawner notices nearby
    -   Challenge level will not decrease until it is reset during a Trial Spawner's cooldown
-   Unlike normal spawners, a Trial Spawner will spawn a limited number of mobs proportional to its current challenge level
    -   It can only spawn a mob at positions that are within line of sight
    -   It can spawn a mob regardless of any light level requirement the mob has
    -   Spawned mobs are persistent
-   Once all mobs are defeated, the Trial Spawner will eject a set of rewards proportional to the current challenge level
    -   After the rewards have been ejected, the Trial Spawner goes into cooldown for 30 minutes during which it will no longer spawn mobs
-   Trial Spawners cannot be crafted nor obtained by players in Survival - instead, they can be found naturally placed throughout Trial Chambers
-   Trial Spawners are extremely slow to mine and resistant to explosions, and will not drop even with Silk Touch
-   When placed in Creative, Trial Spawners have no mob type set by default
    -   The mob type can be set by interacting with it while holding a Spawn Egg
-   Creative and Spectator players cannot be detected or noticed by Trial Spawners

### Trial Chambers

-   Trial Chambers are a new structure in the Overworld where players can explore and take on combat challenges during the mid-game
    -   Trial Chambers are made out of a variety of Copper and Tuff blocks and can be found in different sizes from large to small
    -   Trial Chambers are a relatively common find throughout the Deepslate layer of the underground
-   The layout of each Trial Chamber is procedurally generated, and can include traps, reward chests and a variety of combat spaces
    -   Supply chests can be found between different rooms, and give you blocks and items which help you navigate your trials
    -   Reward chests are guarded by challenges in each room, and can be a source of many high level enchanted books and equipment
    -   The loot found in reward chests are still being iterated, and are absolutely not final
-   Each Trial Chamber will include Trial Spawners with a melee, small melee, or ranged category:
    -   Melee
        -   Zombie
        -   Husk
        -   Slime
    -   Small Melee
        -   Spider
        -   Cave Spider
        -   Baby Zombie
        -   Silverfish
    -   Ranged
        -   Skeleton
        -   Stray
        -   Skeleton with Poison Tipped Arrows
-   Each Trial Spawner category will only use one mob for the entire structure when generated, and these mobs are randomized for each Trial Chamber
    -   For example, one Trial Chamber might only spawn Zombies, Cave Spiders and Strays, while another might only spawn Slimes, Silverfish and Skeletons
    -   The exceptions to this are some Trial Spawners in unique rooms which always spawn Breezes

#### Known issues

-   The corridors sometimes end with a dead end
-   Aquifers, Lush Caves, and Sculk Veins sometimes intersect with the Trial Chamber

### Trial Key

-   An item that can only be obtained from Trial Spawners
-   Trial Keys do not currently have any functionality

In this week's Snapshot we're taking a break from new features to improve ones we've already added, including fixes to Commands and the ability to use Loot Tables with Decorated Pots.

## Changes

-   Copper Doors & Copper Trapdoors has updated textures

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 23

## Data Pack Version 23

-   Decorated Pots can now utilize loot tables and will read from the `LootTable` tag key
-   Additional changes to command functions

### Commands

#### `tick`

-   The `<time>` parameter in the `tick step` command is now optional. The default value is 1

#### `return`

-   `return run` will now always return
    -   If there are no valid results from returned command, function containing `return run` will fail (i.e. `success=0` and `result=0`)
-   `return run` will now propagate success value together with results value (previously it always set success to `1`)
-   `return run` now also allows storing values - that means `execute store ... run return run some_command` will both store value and return it outside function
-   New subcommand `return fail` is added to make whole function fail (i.e. return `success=0` and `result=0`)

#### `function`

-   If `function <function tag>` runs multiple functions in combination with `return run`, execution will stop after first `return` in any of the functions
-   A single call to the `function` command will always have return when run with `return run`
    -   For example, `return run execute [split context] run function <some function with conditional return>` will always return after processing the first context

#### `execute if|unless function`

-   `execute if|unless function` will no longer always fail if all functions had no return
    -   If there were no `returns` in called functions, `if` will fail and `unless` will pass
