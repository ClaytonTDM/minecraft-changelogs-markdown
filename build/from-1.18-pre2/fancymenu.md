# Minecraft 1.18 Pre-Release 2

The second pre-release for Minecraft Java is now available. In this pre-release, we've upgraded the Java version that is bundled with the game, and the game now uses Java 17. Other than this, we've mostly been busy fixing bugs.

Enjoy!

## Technical Changes in 1.18 Pre-Release 2

Minecraft now uses Java version 17. If you are using a default setup the Launcher will download and install the correct version. If you are using a custom Java setup or a third-party launcher, you will need to ensure that your Java installation is version 17 or above.

The first 1.18 pre-release is here!

From now on, you should mostly see bugs being fixed. In addition to that, pre-releases don't follow the regular snapshot cadence of releasing on Wednesdays, so keep an eye out!

That being said, this pre-release introduces biome blending, which means that you should no longer find harsh borders between new and old terrain. On top of that, we've also reintroduced the Amplified and Large Biome world types.

Happy mining!

## Changes in 1.18 Pre-Release 1

-   Amplified and Large biome worlds have been adapted to the new terrain and are now once again available in the Create World screen
-   Removed world types "Caves" and "Floating islands" from the world creation screen
-   The transition between new and old terrain is less "cliffy"
    -   Will surface height blend? Yes
    -   Will biomes blend? Yes
    -   Will caves blend? Your mileage may vary
