# Minecraft 1.18 Pre-Release 2

The second pre-release for Minecraft Java is now available. In this pre-release, we've upgraded the Java version that is bundled with the game, and the game now uses Java 17. Other than this, we've mostly been busy fixing bugs.

Enjoy!

## Technical Changes in 1.18 Pre-Release 2

Minecraft now uses Java version 17. If you are using a default setup the Launcher will download and install the correct version. If you are using a custom Java setup or a third-party launcher, you will need to ensure that your Java installation is version 17 or above.

# Minecraft 1.18 Pre-Release 1

The first 1.18 pre-release is here!

From now on, you should mostly see bugs being fixed. In addition to that, pre-releases don't follow the regular snapshot cadence of releasing on Wednesdays, so keep an eye out!

That being said, this pre-release introduces biome blending, which means that you should no longer find harsh borders between new and old terrain. On top of that, we've also reintroduced the Amplified and Large Biome world types.

Happy mining!

## Changes in 1.18 Pre-Release 1

-   Amplified and Large biome worlds have been adapted to the new terrain and are now once again available in the Create World screen
-   Removed world types "Caves" and "Floating islands" from the world creation screen
-   The transition between new and old terrain is less "cliffy"
    -   Will surface height blend? Yes
    -   Will biomes blend? Yes
    -   Will caves blend? Your mileage may vary

## Technical changes in 1.18 Pre-Release 1

-   `--report` option in data generator now creates full worldgen reference files instead of just biomes

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w44a

Another snapshot is now available. We've added new world generation below existing chunks, and blocks and fluids are now also part of the simulation distance setting. We also fixed a few bugs.

Keep in mind that we're still working on the world upgrades, so making a backup before upgrading is still a good idea.

Enjoy!

## New Features in 21w44a

-   New world generation is now inserted under existing chunks when upgrading a world to the new world height
-   Added an Online options screen where you can now find the Realms Notifications option and Difficulty when on a server
-   Added an "Allow Server Listings" option to opt-out of having your name displayed in server listings

## Changes in 21w44a

-   Sleeping now only resets the weather cycle if it was raining
-   Blocks and fluids are now also affected by simulation distance. It might be a good idea to test that the behavior of your Redstone contraptions remained the same
-   Optimized entity collisions

## Technical Changes in 21w44a

-   Servers can now set property `hide-online-players` to `true` in order to not send a player list on status requests
-   When JFR profiling is started from an external source, the JFR events for network packets are now aggregated instead of one event per packet

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w43a

Here's a snapshot from the blender! In this snapshot, world generation around the edges of an old world will now be adjusted for a smoother transition! This is the first iteration of this system which we expect to keep improving. Keep in mind that if you try it out now, the result will be saved to your world forever - which, as we know, is quite a long time. Better be safe than sorry. Make a backup before you try it!

Also - the space underneath existing chunks is now filled in, but only with deepslate. We will later be adding full cave generation in this place, so if you want that in your world, make a backup before you try it!

Due to some updates to terrain generation in this snapshot, seeds have shuffled once again so worlds will not look like they did in the previous snapshot. We expect world seeds to be stable after this snapshot.

Oh yeah, did we mention that it's a good idea to make a backup?

## New Features in 21w43a

-   The edge between old and new world generation is now adjusted when you upgrade a world

### Upgrading of old worlds

-   When generating close to old chunks hew terrain is adjusted to better match the existing terrain at the borders
-   In old chunks, if there is Bedrock at y=0, the column below will be filled with Deepslate
    -   Worlds upgraded in this snapshot will permanently have this deepslate, so if you want new caves under height 0 later, make sure to keep a backup before upgrading
-   The old Bedrock between y=0 and y=4 in old chunks gets replaced with Deepslate
-   A new Bedrock layer is placed at y=-64

## Changes in 21w43a

-   The Priority Updates video setting has been renamed to Chunk Builder
-   Reduced the amount of flooded caves near river and ocean coastlines
-   Aquifer water levels change less often, so you'll more often have larger areas with the same water level. This means slightly fewer underground waterfalls and slightly easier underground boat travel
-   Lava aquifers are slightly less common
-   Restricted Big Dripleaf placement to Clay, Grass, Dirt, Farmland, Moss, Rooted Dirt, Podzol and Mycelium

## Technical Changes in 21w43a

-   Some internal details of block and fluid ticking have been changed to improve save times. While it should behave exactly as it was, it might be a good time to test your redstone contraptions (on a copy of a world or with a backup, of course)
-   The Chunk format has been updated

### World Data: Chunk Format

-   Removed chunk's `Level` and moved everything it contained up
-   Chunk's `Level.Entities` has moved to `entities`
-   Chunk's `Level.TileEntities` has moved to `block_entities`
-   Chunk's `Level.TileTicks` and `Level.ToBeTicked` have moved to `block_ticks`
-   Chunk's `Level.LiquidTicks` and `Level.LiquidsToBeTicked` have moved to `fluid_ticks`
-   Chunk's `Level.Sections` has moved to `sections`
-   Chunk's `Level.Structures` has moved to `structures`
-   Chunk's `Level.Structures.Starts` has moved to `structures.starts`
-   Chunk's `Level.Sections[].BlockStates` and `Level.Sections[].Palette` have moved to a container structure in `sections[].block_states`
-   Chunk's `Level.Biomes` are now paletted and live in a similar container structure in `sections[].biomes`
-   Added `yPos` the minimum section y position in the chunk
-   Added `below_zero_retrogen` containing data to support below zero generation
-   Added `blending_data` containing data to support blending new world generation with existing chunks

## Fixed bugs in 21w43a

-   [MC-131930](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-131930) Deep warm ocean generates without coral and sea pickles
-   [MC-156616](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-156616) Badlands layers not generating properly

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w42a

It's time for a musical snapshot! We're now introducing new music for Caves & Cliffs: Part II. This time around we have a bunch of new tracks composed by the talented Lena Raine and Kumi Tanioka. These tracks are also available on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/7yQIrNTf3pBu0FdyAJqTqb?si=CC31NZyIQrOl-MNVCNYYkQ) for you to listen to, and they will soon be available on other services such as Apple Music and YouTube as well.

This snapshot also includes a few additional tweaks, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

**We still highly recommend backing up your world before loading it in this snapshot.**

## New Features in 21w42a

-   New music has been added to the game
-   Added world autosave indicator for single-player worlds

### Music

-   Added new music by Lena Raine and Kumi Tanioka to the Overworld (when playing in survival mode) and the main menu
-   Added a new music disc from Lena Raine titled 'otherside'. This can be found rarely in Stronghold corridor chests or much more rarely in Dungeon chests.

## Changes in 21w42a

-   World spawn selection algorithm has been reworked, now spawns player according to climate parameters
-   World generation tweaks

### World Generation

-   Lava springs can generate in mountains and snowy terrain
-   Water springs don't generate higher than y 192, and are slightly less common
-   Badlands gold generates higher up

## Technical Changes in 21w42a

-   Replaced `light` and `barrier` particles with `block_marker`

### Particles

**`block_marker`**

-   Renders with texture declared in `particle` slot for model assigned to configured block state
-   Summoned with same syntax as `block` particle (i.e. `block_marker wheat[age=2]`)

## Bugs fixed in 21w42a

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w41a

Have a random snapshot! In this snapshot, we've replaced the random number generator used for world generation, which makes more seeds come out as different... but it also moves everything around in the world, so expect all worlds to look different in this snapshot.

Another thing that we've replaced is the cubemap - the spinning image that you see behind the main menu. It's pretty sweet!

Also, in case you missed it, we're having our [annual Minecraft Live event](https://www.minecraft.net/live) this Saturday. Make sure to check that out!

**We still highly recommend backing up your world before loading it in this snapshot.**

## Changes in 21w41a

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w39a

Time for an Advanced snapshot! In this snapshot, you can also open worlds from previous versions again - with one big warning! The blending technology we intend to introduce for Caves & Cliffs: Part II is not yet available. If you open an old world in this snapshot it will be upgraded with air under the current bottom of the world and visible chunk borders to new areas.

**We highly recommend backing up your world before loading it in this snapshot.**

## New Features in 21w39a

-   Added Caves & Cliffs: Part II Advancements

### Advancements

-   Added "Caves & Cliffs" for falling from top to bottom of the Overworld
-   Added "Feels like home" for riding strider on lava for 50 blocks in the Overworld
-   Added "Star Trader" for trading with a villager at the build height limit
-   Added "Sound of Music" for playing music with a jukebox in a Meadow biome

## Changes in 21w39a

-   Tweaked peaks to make small mountains look more like proper jagged mountain peaks instead of flat hilly mounds
-   The lone trees in Meadows now always contain a bee nest
-   Drowned can spawn in aquifers inside dripstone caves
-   Zombies don't spawn in dripstone caves
-   Buried treasure chests can now contain water breathing potions
-   Changed default brightness to 50
-   Redesigned how effects look in the inventory screen, to allow them to show even with recipe book open

### Effects

-   Your list of effects are now shown to the right of your inventory, instead of the left side
-   When the inventory effects list is visible, it will be hidden from the game view to reduce screen clutter
-   There's now two modes of seeing the effect list: compact and classic
    -   Classic is the pre-existing list of effects, one after another
    -   Compact is a single icon for each effect, suitable for small screen estate
-   The game will automatically switch between the two looks to suit the available screen estate (including having the recipe book open)

## Technical Changes in 21w39a

-   Added `fall_from_height` and `ride_entity_distance` advancement triggers
-   Changed `nether_travel` to match other similar triggers
-   Added new loot table function `set_potion`
-   Changes to the on-disk chunk format
-   Resource pack format has been increased to 8
-   Standalone `server.jar` now bundles contains individual libraries instead of being flat archive

### Advancements

**New triggers**

**`fall_from_height`**

-   Triggered when a player lands after falling
-   Conditions:
    -   `player` - a player for which this trigger runs
    -   `start_position` - location predicate for last position before falling started
    -   `distance` - predicate for distance between `start_position` and player

**`ride_entity_in_lava`**

-   Triggered for every tick when player rides in lava
-   Conditions
    -   `player` - a player for which this trigger runs
    -   `start_position` - position where riding started (first tick on lava)
    -   `distance` - predicate for distance between `start_position` and player

**Changed triggers**

**`nether_travel`**

-   `entered` condition renamed to `start_position`
-   `exited` has been removed, since it was identical to `player.location`

### Loot Tables

**New functions**

**`set_potion`**

Sets `Potion` tag on any item

**Parameters:**

-   `id` - potion id

### World Data: Chunk Format

-   Chunk's `Level.Sections[].BlockStates` & `Level.Sections[].Palette` have moved to a container structure in `Level.Sections[].block_states`
-   Chunk's `Level.Biomes` are now paletted and live in a similar container structure in `Level.Sections[].biomes`
-   Chunk's `Level.CarvingMasks[]` is now `long[]` instead of `byte[]`

### Resource Pack format

-   `minecraft/textures/gui/container/inventory.png` now contains an extra sprite for a thin-layout version of the effect list in the inventory

### Server bundling

-   `server.jar` now bundles individual libraries instead of merging all the files into single archive
-   This change is meant to solve certain problems related to Java modules
-   On startup, `server.jar` will unpack libraries into directory configured by `bundlerRepoDir` (default: working directory)
-   To run different main class than server, use `bundlerMainClass` property (for example `java -DbundlerMainClass=net.minecraft.data.Main -jar server.jar --reports`) or unpack jar manually and use contents of `META-INF/classpath-joined` for command line

## Fixed bugs in 21w39a

# Minecraft Snapshot 21w38a

The second Caves & Cliffs: Part II snapshot is here! This snapshot mostly contains tweaks and bug fixes, but there are also some new technical additions such as a separate simulation distance slider and an increased thread count (no I'm not talking about the fancy sheets you're thinking about buying).

Oh, and you also seemed to enjoy Strongholds quite a lot, so we decided to add them back into the game. Enjoy!

## Known Issues in 21w38a

-   This snapshot is still not compatible with older worlds - to play in this snapshot, you will have to create a new world
-   World saving can sometimes take a very long time - if you see the world stop moving for a time, this is why

## Changes in 21w38a

-   Sprinting is no longer reduced to walking when gently brushing your sleeve against a wall
-   Fixes for the distribution of ores

### Ore distribution

-   Copper ore generates up to y 95 (as originally designed)
-   Increased the amount of copper
-   Lapis lazuli generates in blobs, like other ores (instead of spread out)

### Sprinting

-   Previously, any collision with a block would reduce sprinting to walking. Now, for very minor angles of collision with a block, players retain their sprint. For larger angles of collision, the old behavior is retained.

## Technical Changes in 21w38a

-   A new setting has been added: "Simulation distance"
-   Maximum amount of background threads increased
-   Added telemetry for world loading

### Simulation distance setting

-   Entities will not be updated outside of simulation distance.
-   Allows higher render distance with less CPU load.
-   A new slider in video settings on the client.
-   A new `simulation-distance` property in dedicated server properties.
-   We will continue working on it with a goal of simulation distance also affecting block and fluid ticking.

### Maximum amount of background threads increased

Various background tasks including worldgen are executed on a background thread pool. Its size equals the amount of available CPU threads minus one, but there was an upper limit of 7. Now this upper limit is 255. This should help higher-end machines with world-gen performance.

The upper limit can be overridden by `max.bg.threads` Java system property, for example when running multiple servers on a single machine.

### Telemetry

In this release, we are re-introducing diagnostic tracking, which was part of Minecraft: Java Edition until 2018. We are bringing it back to better understand our players and to improve their experience. Specifically, we hope to ensure stronger performance for the extremely heavy world generation in the second part of the Caves & Cliffs update later this year.

In practice, this can mean identifying technical pain points in the game, like how less powerful hardware performs in high-complexity terrain. This information will also help us prioritize various aspects of development, balance game features (by learning, for instance, that the goats are pushing every single player off the cliffs) and lend new Minecrafters a helping hand (after realizing that many of them get stuck at the same points). All data is treated according to GDPR and CCPA best practices and is used to develop a better-performing and generally more enjoyable Minecraft: Java Edition.

At this point the only implemented event is world load.

**World Load event**

-   Sent when loading singleplayer world or connecting to multiplayer server
-   Contains following information:
    -   launcher identifier
    -   user identitifer (XUID)
    -   client session id (changes on restart)
    -   world session id (changes per world load, to be reused for later events)
    -   game version
    -   operating system name and version
    -   Java runtime version
    -   if client or server is modded (same information as on crash logs)
    -   server type (single player, Realms or other)
    -   game mode

## Bugs fixed in 21w38a
