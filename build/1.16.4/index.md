# Minecraft: Java Edition 1.16.4

It's time for the 1.16.4 release! This release adds the new social interactions screen and fixes a few crashes.

If you missed it, we recently announced that Mojang accounts will be migrating into Microsoft accounts. This release prepares for that by having the game understand the settings and block-list of Microsoft accounts. You can read more about it over [here](https://www.minecraft.net/article/java-edition-moving-house), and you can find answers to questions you might have in the [FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360050865492), which will be continuously updated.
