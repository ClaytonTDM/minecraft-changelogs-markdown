# Minecraft Snapshot 20w28a

This week's snapshot introduces experimental support for custom biomes in data packs. This work has involved redoing some of the internal plumbing of things behind the scene, so it might be a bit leaky. We hope no important parts drip out, but if they do, pick them back up for us, please.

As always, make sure to make backups if you try a world in a snapshot.

## Changes in 20w28a

​

-   Villagers now emit green particles when joining a village, setting a home bed, or acquiring a job site/profession
-   Brewing stands can now be crafted with blackstone
-   Tweaked bartering loot
-   Totems of undying now give the fire resistance status affect for 40 seconds when activated

​

## Technical Changes in 20w28a

​

-   Custom worlds now support custom biomes
-   Dedicated servers can now rate limit clients

​

### Customized world generation

​

-   There is now experimental support for a `worldgen` folder in data packs
-   `worldgen/biome` can contain biome definitions
-   `worldgen/configured_carver` can contain definitions for world carver settings
-   `worldgen/configured_feature` can contain definitions for feature placements
-   `worldgen/configured_structure_feature` can contain definitions for structure placements
-   `worldgen/configured_surface_builder` can contain definitions for surfaces
-   `worldgen/processor_list` can contain sets of block processors

-   Custom biomes can now be used in the single biome/caves/floating islands world types (add the data pack containing the biome first)
-   Custom biomes can now be used in custom dimension generators

​

### Dedicated server packet limit

​

-   Dedicated servers can now kick clients that consistently send too many packets within a second
-   Controlled with the `rate-limit` settings in `server.properties`
-   The default rate limit of 0 means "no limit"

In this snapshot, we're adding support for custom world settings and custom dimensions. This is an early release to hear your feedback about this feature - do note that this support is considered experimental and unsupported. Any custom world settings may change from one snapshot to the next, and worlds using custom settings will be clearly marked as experimental in your worlds list. ​

## New Features in 20w21a

​

-   Added the ability to toggle redstone wire between a cross and a dot
-   Added import/export world settings functionality
-   Added a new disableMultiplayer command line option - when used, the Multiplayer button is disabled
-   Added a new disableChat command line option - when used, receiving and sending online chat is disabled

​

### Redstone Toggle

​

-   When right clicking a single piece of redstone, it toggles between a the cross and the dot
-   A dot of redstone will not power its surrounding blocks

​

## Changes in 20w21a

​

-   Piglins no longer walk around when admiring gold
-   If you hurt a piglin while it is admiring an ingot, the ingot will now disappear
-   Increased the chance of ores to generate in the Basalt Deltas to balance against the reduced amount of Netherrack in this biome
-   Lily pads are now considered junk fishing loot rather than treasure
-   Updated logos for Mojang Studios and Minecraft
-   Temporarily removed structure settings from flat level preset strings (workaround: use import/export settings functionality)

​

## Technical Changes in 20w21a

​

-   Added the ability to control the height of the `spreadplayers` command
-   Added custom worlds and custom dimensions

​

### Commands

​

#### `spreadplayers`

​ Added an optional argument to specify maximum height. New syntax: `spreadplayers <center> <spreadDistance> <maxRange> [under <maxHeight>] <respectTeams> <targets>` ​

-   `maxHeight` - Specifies the maximum height for resulting positions

​

#### `locate`

​

-   Structure names are now specified as lowercase

​

### Custom Worlds

​

-   Added experimental support for new custom worlds
-   Edit world screen now has an option to export world settings to a JSON file
-   During world creation you can import previously exported world settings
-   A bunch of new parameters are exposed, but marked as experimental, meaning you can play with them, but there is no guarantee that any of them will continue working (even in the next snapshot!)
-   Flat level preset string lost structure settings (they are now stored in a common format for all worlds), we will restore some form of this functionality soon
-   Buffet world can no longer be created from server.properties, flat level settings changed a bit; better support for custom world creation on the server is coming soon
