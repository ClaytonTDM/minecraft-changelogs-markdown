Time for another pre-release, this time with some final tweaks to candles and more fixes for bugs and crashes!

Note that a bug has snuck into this pre-release making the game warn about every world as if it was experimental. This will be fixed in the next pre-release.

# Changes in 1.17 Pre-release 3

-   Tweaked the textures of lit candles
-   Mobs rammed by goats will no longer retaliate
-   Axolotls and Glow Squids now only spawn in total darkness and where there's a natural stone block less than 5 blocks below the spawning space
