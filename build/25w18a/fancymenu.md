# Minecraft Snapshot 25w18a

Leads have become a hot commodity in the recent snapshots and this week they are getting an updated recipe, making it much easier to craft leads for all your leashing needs. The dried ghast is also getting a new recipe, based on soul sand and ghast tears. We have updated Unifont to 16.0.03 and this time we included glyphs from Unifont's Private Use Areas. That means creators will now be able to use scripts in the Under-ConScript Unicode Registry like Tengwar or Sitelen Pona.

## Changes

-   Splash Potions effect strength is now based on the distance of the hitboxes
-   The Slime Ball in the Lead recipe has been replaced with a String
-   Piglins can now give Dried Ghast Blocks when bartered with
-   The recipe for the Dried Ghast Block has been updated to now require a Soul Sand Block rather than a Bone Block

### Splash Potions

-   Splash Potions distance to affected entities now depends on the closest distance between the entity hitbox and the splash potion hitbox where it landed
    -   This means that if an entity is hit directly by the splash potion, it will receive the full effect of the potion
    -   If the entities are grouped together, they will receive the same effect strength

## Technical Changes

-   The Data Pack version is now 75
-   The Resource Pack version is now 59
-   All JSON files (in worlds, packs, configuration, etc.) are now parsed in strict mode

## Data Pack Version 75

### Entity Data

-   Added `home_pos` and `home_radius` fields to all mobs
    -   Mobs with set home position will limit their pathfinding to stay within the indicated area
    -   Some mobs, like Bats, Slimes, Magma Cubes, Phantoms and Ender Dragons may ignore it
    -   Interacting with leashes or riding may change the home position of the mob

#### Entity Tags

-   Updated `#followable_friendly_mobs` to include the Happy Ghast

## Resource Pack Version 59

-   Updated Unifont to 16.0.03

### UI Sprites

-   The `hud/locator_bar_arrow_up` and `hud/locator_bar_arrow_down` sprites are now animated with a standard `animation` definition in the corresponding `.mcmeta` files

### Font

#### Unifont

-   Updated Unifont to 16.0.03
-   Added previously omitted Unifont glyphs for Private Use Areas
    -   Those glyphs are loaded as a separate sub-font `minecraft:include/unifont_pua` and are not included in any normally used font
    -   Characters in those areas are managed by Under-CSUR (Under-ConScript Unicode Registry), which adds various scripts not present in official Unicode set, like Tengwar or Sitelen Pona

#### `unihex` Font Provider

-   Field `size_overrides` is now optional (defaults to empty list)
