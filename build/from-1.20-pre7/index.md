# Minecraft 1.20 Pre-release 7

Pre-release 7 for Minecraft 1.20 is now available in the Minecraft Launcher. This pre-release adds validation of symbolic links and fixes a bug.

### Changes

To improve safety, the game will now detect symbolic links used inside world directory. For a detailed explanation, check our [help article](https://aka.ms/MinecraftSymLinks).

-   If the target of a symbolic link is not on the user-configured allow-list, the game will not proceed with loading the world
    -   Note: world directory itself can still be linked
-   The list of allowed symbolic link targets is stored in file `allowed_symlinks.txt` in client or server top directory
-   The file consists of entries (one per line) with following formats allowed:
    -   Lines starting with `#` are comments and are ignored
    -   `[type]pattern`, where `type` can be `glob`, `regex` or `prefix`
        -   `prefix` matches start of path with given pattern (so for `/test` paths `/test`, `/test/` and `/test/foo.txt` would match)
        -   `regex` matches regular expression against whole path
        -   `glob` uses OS-specific path matching mechanism (for example `*.txt` would usually match files with `txt` extension)
        -   Note: paths will use OS-specific separators
    -   `pattern`, which uses default `prefix` type

## Fixed bug in 1.20 Pre-release 7

The sixth pre-release of the 1.20 update is here, yet again containing more bug fixes.

Happy mining!

## Technical Changes

-   `"item": "minecraft:air"` can no longer be used in datapack recipes
-   Ingredients in array form are now also allowed in `smithing_trim` and `smithing_transform` recipes on fields `template`, `base` and `addition`
    -   Those fields also allow empty arrays, which signalize that slot needs to be left empty

### Loot tables

#### Random sequences

The ID of the random sequence is now an optional field. If no sequence name is given, loot is drawn using a non-deterministic random source.
