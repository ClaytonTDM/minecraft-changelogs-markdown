# 25w07a

Frogday on a Thursday, who thinks of that?! In this week's snapshot we are updating trades for wandering traders and cartographers. We have also introduced new, biome-based spawn rules for sheep. It's time to go out and explore the world! Mojang's bug-tracker Mojira is migrating to the cloud and during the process bug reporting is unavailable. The new platform will soon be up and running, ready for players to log in, create accounts, and most importantly â€“ report bugs! During the downtime, try to keep the bug alive and report it once Mojira is back!

## New Features

-   Sheep have different rules for which wool color to have based on biome they spawn in

### Farm Animal variants

#### Sheep wool color in warm and cold biomes

-   Sheep have updated rules for which color of wool they have based on which biome they spawn in:
    -   Temperate Biomes: (these colors are unchanged from current behavior)
        -   Common sheep color is white
        -   Uncommon sheep colors are black, gray, light gray and brown
        -   There is a rare chance for a pink Sheep to spawn
    -   Cold biomes:
        -   Common Sheep color is black
        -   Uncommon Sheep colors are light gray, light blue, blue and cyan
        -   There is a rare chance for a pink Sheep to spawn
    -   Warm Biomes:
        -   Common Sheep color is brown
        -   Uncommon Sheep colors are gray, yellow, orange and red
        -   There is a rare chance for a pink Sheep to spawn

## Changes

-   A Bush only drops when broken with Shears or a Silk Touch tool and is replaceable when building
-   The look of both Mooshroom variants have been slightly updated to have an extruded snout
-   Ambient block sounds in Desert, Badlands and Pale Garden which are only used for ambience have been moved from "Blocks" to "Ambient/Environment" category
-   Cartographer and Wandering Trader has tweaks to their trades
-   Camels now spawn in Deserts
-   Bundles can now be found in some of the chests in villages
-   The breaking sound for grass sound type has been lowered affecting all blocks using this sound

### Cartographer and Wandering Trader Trade Rebalance

## Cartographer Trades

-   Cartographers now sell 7 new maps each pointing to a different village or other structures in a different biome. These maps can help players who want to quickly find a specific location
-   Cartographers from different village types will sell a different range of maps and colored banners
-   Some prices and quantities have also been adjusted

![Cartographers now sell maps to structures in different biomes (villages in Desert, Plains, Savanna, Snowy Plains or Taiga, the Swamp Hut in a Swamp or the Jungle Temple in a Jungle). Cartographers in different biomes will have a different selection of these maps, available at Apprentice level. The previously existing maps to Trial Chambers and Ocean Monuments are available at Journeyman level. Colored banners are sold at Expert level and the range is different in different biomes. A Woodland Mansion map is guaranteed at Master level along with the globe banner pattern.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/25w07acartographertrades.jpg)

## Wandering Trader Trades

-   The Wandering Trader now has better prices, more trades and a larger amount of stock for many items
-   They will also now buy basic supplies from players, so it's possible to get some emeralds by helping them prepare for their next journey even if you don't feel like buying anything
-   The Wandering Trader will offer to buy two items from this list:
    -   Water Bottle
    -   Water Bucket
    -   Milk Bucket
    -   Fermented Spider Eye
    -   Baked Potato
    -   Hay Bale
-   Wandering Traders now have a chance of selling these items (in addition to their previous trades):
    -   Logs (Acacia, Birch, Dark Oak, Jungle, Oak, Spruce, Pale Oak or Cherry)
    -   Enchanted Iron Pickaxe
    -   Potion of Invisibility

![Each Wandering Trader has two buying trades (buying Water Bottle, Water Bucket, Milk Bucket, Spider Eye, 4 Baked Potatoes or a Hay Bale) which give emeralds in return. They also have two 'special offers' where they sell Ice, Gunpowder, an Enchanted Pickaxe or any type of Logs, and five normal offers which are similar to the trades they had before this update.](https://launchercontent.mojang.com/v2/images/25w07awanderingtradertrades.jpg)

### Shaders & Post-process Effects

> **Developer's Note**: _Although it is possible in Resource Packs, overriding Core Shaders is considered as unsupported and not an intended Resource Pack feature. These shaders exist as part of the internal implementation of the game, and as such, may change at any time as the game's internals evolve. We understand that overriding Core Shaders is used for very cool Resource Pack features, many of which lack supported alternatives. We would like to provide better, supported alternatives in the future._

-   Shader program definitions for core shaders and post-processing effects as JSON files have been removed
-   The shader programs themselves are still available and can be overridden
-   The post-processing effects are still configurable as JSON

#### Post-process Effect Definitions

-   The field `program` was replaced with `vertex_shader` and `fragment_shader`
    -   `<namespace>:<path>` will resolve to `assets/<namespace>/shaders/<path>.<vsh|fsh>`
-   `type` is now a required field for each `uniform`
    -   Possible values are currently `int`, `ivec3`, `float`, `vec2`, `vec3`, `vec4`, `matrix4`
-   `values` in each `uniform` is now optional
    -   Leaving it unset is not recommended and is used for runtime configuration of the blur effect
-   Leaving a uniform unspecified results in undefined behavior, you must specify each one that will be used by the shaders

### Item rendering

#### Item Display

-   `firstperson_lefthand` and `thirdperson_lefthand` transforms are now rendered the same as when held in hand

#### Item Entity

-   When on ground, model size is now taken into account when determining hovering motion
    -   That means that models should never clip into the block below, no matter what size they are
-   Positioning of items in an item stack on ground now depends on model size and model type
    -   If model depth (Z coordinate) is below 1/16th of a block, item is rendered as flat stack of items
    -   Otherwise model is rendered as a cluster of items offset in all directions around center
    -   Previously, flat stack rendering happened only for models with `builtin/generated` parent
