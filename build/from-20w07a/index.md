# Minecraft Snapshot 20w07a

Ahh, a freshly baked snapshot! It undoubtedly smells better than the piglins that we just added...

## Features in 20w07a

-   Endermen can now pick up some of the new Nether blocks
-   Endermen will no longer pick up Netherrack
-   Gave Hoglins some actual functionality
-   Added Piglins
-   Netherite blocks can be used as the base of a beacon and Netherite ingots can be used as the fuel for a beacon. Weird flex but ok.

### Advancements

-   Piglins and hoglins are now required for Monster Hunter and Monsters Hunted

### Hoglins

-   Hoglins are big aggressive beasts that live in crimson forests in the nether
-   They attack players on sight, so be careful, they can easily knock you off a ledge!
-   Hoglins drop pork and sometimes leather, but not willingly
-   You can breed hoglins by feeding them crimson fungi, but do so at your own risk
-   Hoglins get hunted by piglins sometimes, but they don't go down without a fight!
-   Despite this, hoglins and piglin aren't enemies - they are more like an ecosystem
-   Baby hoglins like to pretend they are tough - but don't worry, they are more like angry puppies with no teeth
-   Want to keep hoglins off your back? Pro tip: Hoglins hate the smell of warped fungi!

### Piglins

-   Piglins are an aggressive civilization that live in the nether
-   They mostly hang around in the crimson forest, but you might find some in the nether wastes too
-   They think of players as target practice and will attack on sight
-   However if you dress appropriately they will see you as a respectable figure, or tolerable at least
-   Piglins are suspicious of strangers and if they see you opening a chest, or mining a block of gold, they will assume that you're stealing and will treat you accordingly
-   Piglins LOVE gold and get very distracted by gold items
-   Gold ingots are currency to piglins and you can throw ingots at them or right-click them with an ingot to barter for various goods
-   Piglins sometimes get hungry and hunt hoglins for food. Or they try at least. They results... vary.
-   Piglins prefer to hunt and fight in groups, and when a fight is happening everyone wants in
-   Piglins that somehow end up in the overworld become zombified fairly quickly
-   Piglins are creeped out by soul fire and zombified piglins, and will stay clear whenever possible
-   Wither skeletons are a historic enemy and piglins will attack on sight
-   Baby piglins are not as dangerous, but they can be mischievous so watch your back
-   ... and they like to play with baby hoglins

## Features in 20w06a

-   Added new Nether blocks!
-   Knockback resistance is now a scale instead of a probability
-   Added Crimson Forest biome to the Nether
-   Added Hoglins - they don't do much yet, but they have cute flappy ears!
-   Patrols no longer spawn when the player is close to any village
-   Added Netherite!
-   Added Soulsand Valley biome to the Nether
-   Walls do not have gaps anymore when stacked vertically
-   Added Warped Forest biome to the Nether

### Blocks

Many new block types have been added!

-   Two new wood-like materials - Crimson Stems and Warped Stems
-   Basalt blocks - you can find them as pillars but they can be placed in any direction
-   New ground surface blocks: Crimson Nylium and Warped Nylium
-   New vegetation: Nether Sprouts, Crimson Roots and Warped Roots
-   Two types of Fungi: Crimson and Warped - try using bone meal to grow them!
-   Warped Wart blocks
-   Weeping Vines that grow from the bottom of a block downwards!
-   A new natural light source: Shroomlights
-   Added Soul Soil! Whenever fire burns on Soul Soil, it burns with a blue flame!
-   Soul Soil can be used to craft Soul Torches - and those can be crafted into Soul Lanterns!
-   Using bone meal on Netherrack can now spread Nylium

### Crimson Forest

Crimson Forests can now be found in the Nether!

-   Crimson nylium carpets the cave floor with all kinds of strange new vegetation
-   Huge Crimson Fungi make up the "trees" of this forest, with Shroomlights lighting up the forest floor
-   Weeping Vines grow from the cave ceilings and fungi
-   Hoglins wander these Forests
-   Crimson spores swirl through the air

### Netherite

-   A new high level material found in the Nether. Use it to upgrade your diamond gear!

#### How to make Netherite

-   Mine Ancient Debris in the lower depths of the Nether. At own risk. No insurance coverage for that.
-   Refine it into Netherite Scrap in a furnace (although that's kind of slow so you might want a Blast Furnace).
-   Combine 4 Nether Scrap with 4 Gold Ingots in a crafting table to make a Netherite Ingot.

#### Netherite effects

-   Netherite items float in lava. So you don't lose all your gear after that unplanned lava bath.
-   Netherite items have higher enchantment value than diamond (but not as high as gold).
-   Netherite tools work faster and last longer than diamond.
-   Netherite weapons do more damage than diamond.
-   Netherite armor have higher toughness and durability than diamond.
-   Netherite armor gives you knockback resistance, so you barely get knocked back at all when hit by arrows and such.
-   And it looks cool!

### Soulsand Valley

Soulsand Valleys can now be found in the Nether!

-   An open space made mostly of Soul Sand and Soul Soil
-   Basalt pillars span from floor to ceiling
-   Fossile remains of unknown creatures from the past litter the valley
-   Ash falls through the air
-   A light blue glow envelopes the valley
-   Beware of Skeletons here

### Sounds

-   Ghasts sounds are now heard at shorter range
-   Updated block sounds for Bone Blocks, Netherrack, Soul Sand, Netherwart, Nether Bricks and Quartz Ore

### Warped Forest

Warped Forests can now be found in the Nether!

-   Warped nylium carpets the cave floor with all kinds of strange new vegetation
-   Huge Warped Fungi make up the "trees" of this forest, with Shroomlights lighting up the forest floor
-   A dark blue fog covers the forest!
-   Warped spores swirl through the air
-   The Warped Forests are strange, but also the least hostile place of Nether

### World Generation

-   The old Nether biome is now called Nether Wastes
-   Made shipwrecks and ocean ruins a bit less common, so you get more excited when you find one!

## Technical changes in 20w06a

-   Added a `locatebiome` command

### Commands

#### locatebiome

New command that locates a specified biome. Useful in creative mode when you're looking for a specific biome and don't want to fly around randomly searching for it. Syntax: `locatebiome <biome>` Parameters:

-   `biome` - The id of the biome to find

### Particles

-   New particle types: ash, crimson\_spore, soul\_fire\_flame and warped\_spore

### Rendering

-   Nailed Entity shadows to the ground.
